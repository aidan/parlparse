		    <p class="H3SectionHeading">Assembly Business</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. During last Tuesday&rsquo;s debate on the draft  Budget, the Minister responsible for the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety (DHSSPS) moved to the Back Benches in order to speak out.  However, instead of speaking as a constituency Member, he spoke as a Minister.  Will you look into that matter and give a ruling on it, Mr Speaker?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I thank the Member for that point of order. I have already written to the  Minister reminding <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">him of the conventions  and practices when a Minister is</span> called  as a private Member. I have dealt with the matter.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Future Delivery Arrangements of the Community Festivals  Fund</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure that he  wishes to make a statement regarding the future delivery arrangements of the  community festivals fund.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr Poots)</strong>: I welcome this opportunity to make a  statement on the future delivery arrangements for the community festivals fund.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Community festivals have for some time been important  vehicles for local communities to celebrate their social and cultural heritage  and the talents of their people. They entertain us, educate us and enrich our  lives. Many community festivals have grown from modest beginnings as a result  of the vision and efforts of dedicated volunteers who encourage and inspire  others to make things happen. They instil a sense of belonging among  organisers, performers and audiences and play a vital role in knitting together  the fabric of communities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The scale and nature of those events are extremely varied.  One of the oldest and best known is the West Belfast F&eacute;ile, which began some 20  years ago in the difficult circumstances of those times. It is now one of the  biggest community festivals in Europe and attracts internationally renowned  artists and provides a programme of events that appeals to a wide audience,  including visitors to Northern    Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the number of participants and the size of  the audience, the biggest event is the Twelfth celebrations, with the largest  parade in Belfast  and local events throughout the Province. I know that efforts are ongoing on  the part of the Orange Order and others to promote the day as a family-friendly  festival that benefits the economy through exploiting the potential for  cultural tourism.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many other colourful re-enactments of important events in  our history are celebrated year on year. There are also smaller festivals in  which local communities expound their culture and talents through music, the  arts, sport and heritage &mdash; for example, the Glasgow&shy;bury Music Festival, held  in the Sperrins near Drapers&shy;town, which brings together emerging performers  and fans of contemporary music from all parts of the community and further  afield.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Another example is Country Comes to Town, held in  Portadown, where the town centre is taken over for <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">a day by displays of farm animals, agricultural machinery</span> and all  things rural. In my constituency, there is the culinary sophistication of the  Hillsborough Oyster Festival. The Lady of the Lake Festival,  based in Irvinestown, has been running for many years and is an important date in the calendar for boating  enthusiasts on both sides of the border. There are also festivals emerging that are organised by ethnic minorities,  which raise awareness of their cultures among the general community,  thereby enhancing mutual understanding and good relations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that Members will all agree that this is an  eclectic mix, and I have mentioned only a few of the community festivals  organised across the country. All these events, in some way or other,  contribute to <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">major Government initiatives  such as &lsquo;A Shared Future&rsquo;.</span> The organisation of such events builds  confidence and develops skills and capacity that may be used to address other  issues facing those communities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, as with all such activity, it costs money to  organise community festivals. In the past, small pockets of funding were  available from a number of Departments, but this was not widely known and, with  a lack of capacity in new and emerging festivals, the funds were not easily accessible.  Only a small number of specified festivals were supported from public funds.  These included the West Belfast F&eacute;ile, the Ardoyne Fleadh and the Greater New  Lodge Festival.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Following a review of community-festival funding and  consultation with stakeholders, it was clear that a more transparent, fair and  equitable funding policy was required. From  this process emerged the community festival fund, which came into  operation in April 2006. The main purpose  of the fund is to improve the capacity of community festivals, so as to  make them more sustainable and less reliant on public funding. The fund enables  community organisations to celebrate their cultural identity and to strengthen  community relations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The budget for the community festivals fund is a relatively modest &pound;450,000 per annum. The  Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) entered into a two-year  agreement with the Northern Ireland Events Company (NIEC) as the delivery agent  for the fund. In 2006-07, the fund supported 42 festivals from all parts of Northern Ireland,  the majority of which had not previously received public funding. In 2007-08,  the fund has so far supported 40 festivals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Part of the community festivals budget has also been used  to provide training for festival organisers, the vast majority of whom are  volunteers. The skills developed through this training become embedded in local  communities, thereby increasing their confidence and building capacity to  address wider issues. Demand for this was high, particularly in the first year  of the <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">fund, reflecting the lack of  capacity in many communities</span>. This  support for the development of skills and knowledge is a sound  investment for the future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During the second year of operation, NIEC commissioned an  independent evaluation of the community festivals fund, which was carried out by Community Evaluation Northern Ireland. The  report concluded that the fund is  making a valuable contribution to the realisation of a number of key  Government policies and priorities, including promoting good relations and  social cohesion. It also concluded that the events supported make a significant  contribution to community life and that, given the number of communities  benefiting from the fund, the diversity and range of activities and events  supported and the considerable level of voluntary input, the fund represents  good value for money.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The evaluation also highlighted a number of areas where the administration of the fund could be  improved, including the introduction  of a less complex application process for smaller grant awards. The  application process was seen to be dispro&shy;portionate to the amount of grant  sought, and was likely to inhibit some of the least able groups from applying  for support.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the light of that, I have concluded that the community festivals  fund provides positive benefits to local communities at a relatively modest  cost to the public purse. The fund will, therefore, continue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">However, I have  reviewed the future delivery arrange&shy;</span>&shy;ments, taking into account the  emerging findings from the review of public administration (RPA). Under the  RPA, the work undertaken by NIEC was to transfer to the Northern Ireland  Tourist Board (NITB) on 1 April 2008. Never&shy;theless,  it was not envisaged that community festivals would be part of that  transfer, as that function is not central to NITB&rsquo;s remit. It is recorded in  the RPA that the community festivals fund should transfer as a function to  local government and, in the most recent paper from my colleague Arlene Foster,  Minister of the Environment, on the emerging findings and next steps, that  position remains.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The vision of the Northern Ireland Local Government  Association (NILGA) for new local government <strong>is</strong>:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to develop vibrant and cohesive local communities, in  which all citizens have a voice and opportunities to shape the service which  contribute to their quality of life.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that the logical home for the community  festivals fund is with local government. Local councils already have  departments that deal directly with local communities,  and officers who specialise in community development. That direct  interface means that councils are best  placed to build capacity at grass roots level, and to identify the events that will benefit their  communities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My intention, therefore, is to transfer the delivery of the  community festivals fund to local authorities from 1 April 2008. It is a  pressing issue, as there is a significant lead-in time for the funding  application process. In most cases, planning for festivals in 2008 is already under  way, and organisers need to know their budgets to enable them to book artistes,  venues and equipment well in advance. By transferring admin&shy;istration of the  fund to local government, it becomes much  closer to the community and the people it supports, making it more  responsive to differing local needs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of the  Environment has confirmed that, given the pressing need to inform  festival organisers of funding  arrangements, she fully supports my proposals. My Department has taken legal advice, and I  under&shy;stand that there is no legal impediment to an early transfer of  the functions to local authorities. No legislation is required, as local  authorities already have statutory powers to  fund local events. Indeed, many local councils are already involved in  funding festivals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department has consulted with the Department of Finance  and Personnel (DFP) on the mechanics of trans&shy;ferring  the fund to local government. The preferred option is that DCAL retains responsibility for community  festivals policy, and that the Department makes an annual allocation to each  council under a specific grant process. That model is successfully operated by  the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister to award grants to district councils for their community-relations  programmes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Councils will be required to take account of the  Department&rsquo;s policy and guidance framework on community festivals. However,  consistent with the ethos of devolving decisions to local councils, they will  have considerable flexibility to develop their own application processes, with  local criteria. As councils already operate a number of small grant schemes,  that should not be onerous to administer. Furthermore, I anticipate that the  application process will be much less onerous for festival organisers, and I  know that they will welcome that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is my view that councils should support local community  festivals from their own resources; there&shy;fore,  I shall seek match funding. Many councils already fund community  festivals, and will continue to do so, and pooling of the community festivals  fund and local support will maximise the benefit. The Department will liaise  with NILGA on the detailed arrangements for implementing the scheme.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I intend to move quickly to transfer those functions to  local government, because local councils will need lead-in time to publicise  the new arrangements and to process applications for events that are to be held  in the spring and summer of 2008. I am confident that the House will agree that  that is the best way forward for the delivery of the community festivals fund.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McElduff)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh r&aacute;iteas an Aire. I welcome  the Minister&rsquo;s bringing the state&shy;ment to the House. I agree with him that  community festivals play a vital role in our social and economic life. I am  pleased that he referred to F&eacute;ile an Phobail, and to the scale of that  particular community-based festival. In the past, the organisers of F&eacute;ile an  Phobail often felt that fine words were not matched by appropriate funding  levels, but I shall leave that issue to one side for now.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also note that responsibility for the community festivals  fund is to transfer to local government, which, as the Minister has said, is  its logical home. In 2006-07 and 2007-08, how many projects west of the Bann  received public funding or support from the Events Company? How was that  funding administered and rolled out?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Do the Minister and the  Department intend to increase the overall budget for the community  festivals fund? It currently stands at a relatively modest &pound;450,000, but are  there any plans to increase that figure? Moreover, the community festivals  fund&rsquo;s profile was never high enough in rural areas. Can the Minister confirm  whether the Ulster Fleadh Cheoil, which was held for two years in a row in  Coalisland, received any support or funding from the community festivals fund?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The following councils west of the Bann received  public funding: Omagh District Council applied for funding for two events and received &pound;7,000, although Omagh  will now get considerably more than that; Limavady Borough Council applied for  funding for three events and received  &pound;12,000; Londonderry&rsquo;s council applied  for funding for four events and received &pound;38,000; Coleraine is on the Bann, and Coleraine Borough  Council applied for funding for five events and received &pound;15,500;  Cookstown District Council and Strabane District Council did not receive  anything; Fermanagh District Council applied for funding for three events and  received &pound;13,200; and Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council applied for  funding for four events and received &pound;12,090. I suppose that Craigavon is also  on the Bann, and Craigavon Borough Council received &pound;24,400, having applied for  funding for four events. Almost all those councils will receive an increase in  funding as a result of this morning&rsquo;s announcement. Those local authorities  will be able to liaise closely with individuals to deliver that funding.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson asked whether additional funding would be  made available. I want councils to match the budget of &pound;450,000. Many councils  already contribute to festivals, so they will not be asked to give more.  However, money is to be given out on the basis that councils at least match  whatever we give them. If, for example, a council were to get &pound;20,000 from us,  it must match that &pound;20,000. Should councils wish to put more into festivals,  that is totally their decision.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>: I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Under direct rule, funding  of festivals was inequitable and discriminatory. Year after year, preferential  treatment was given to the three nationalist &mdash; indeed, republican &mdash; festivals  in north and west Belfast.  Those three festivals were locked into funding, to the exclusion of other  festivals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What was the breakdown of funding for festivals last year,  particularly for the aforementioned festivals? Will the Minister assure us that  we will see a change and that funding of festivals will be an equitable and  equality-driven process?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Festivals that were perceived as being nationalist festivals, based on the  community-back&shy;ground designation on funding application forms, received  &pound;120,242.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Festivals that were perceived as cross-community in  character received funding of &pound;113,015. Festivals that were perceived as unionist in character received funding of &pound;45,150. Indian festivals received funding of  &pound;5,000, and Turkish festivals received funding of &pound;3,000.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. The measures that he has announced are  innovative and in keeping with forward thinking.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister provide details of what the  specific-grant system and match funding mean for the proportion of funding that  will be available to each council &mdash; particularly for Ards Borough Council, Down  District Council, and Castlereagh Borough Council in my constituency of  Strangford?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  do not have to hand the details for each council, but funding will be based on  population and levels of deprivation. Deprivation has already been taken into  account by the Department in deciding on the distribution of funding. It is up  to councils what to do thereafter, but they are not under any obligation to  consider deprivation in their distribution of festival funding because the  Department will already have done that. That is the legitimate and correct  thing to do, and that is worth emphasising.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Ards Borough Council would receive a considerable amount of  money as a result of the measures that I have outlined &mdash; without being  specific, that will probably be roughly &pound;40,000 in match funding.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I also wish to commend the Minister on his statement and on his leadership in  such a short period of time, which will give comfort to groups that have great  worries and concerns. Perhaps, at a later stage, he can deal with the issue of  community sport.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that funding will be allocated on the  basis of population distribution and deprivation levels. In common with other  Members, I share the view that the return on such small investment is enormous, in respect of acknowledging and  recognising people&rsquo;s cultural and historical backgrounds.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Are figures available on  the grants that were awarded by the Events Company over the past two  years? One would imagine that the idea of a community festival is to encourage  others to come forward with ideas for new festivals &mdash; it cannot just be the  usual suspects all the time. We must be innovative in allowing other cities and  community groups to take advantage of funding. What has the Minister in mind in  that respect?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I particularly welcome funding for the Maiden City  Festival, the Gas Yard F&eacute;ile, an Gael&aacute;ras, and the Golden Links Festival. We  want those events to continue, but it is important that others have similar  opportunities.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Funding was introduced to assist communities to develop festivals, to introduce  fresh revenue streams, to help groups liaise with &mdash; and secure sponsorship from  &mdash; the private sector, and to allow groups to demonstrate to the private sector  that festivals can bring significant benefits.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not the view of my Department that festival funding  should remain with the same groups. Once a festival is established and up and  running, it may still require some funding &mdash;  and most of them will. How&shy;ever, as capacity develops, festivals should  be able to develop a greater capacity for introducing funding from the private  sector, because they should be able to demonstrate the ability to organise a  good-quality festival that will bring many local people into an area and bring  real benefits for that community, and for the business sector. The training  work that took place in the past year should have assisted in that, and should  help smaller groups to get established.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We want to see festival funding continually moving so that  more groups and new festivals are introduced and brought on stream, widening  the scope of such funding.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  very much welcome the Minister&rsquo;s new approach, which will also be welcomed by  many communities that, in the past, when  applying for funding for community festivals, had to approach their  local council, the Events Company, and various sponsors.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I think that the new approach will simplify the process. My  concern is that if it is cost-effective, we will need to increase the pot of money; first, from the Department of  Culture, Arts and Leisure and, secondly, using match funding from councils.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">How will the process work as regards the councils? Do they  all have the same capacity to provide full match funding or would some of them  be discouraged from providing such funding?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: As  regards the latter point, for my own council, it would mean finding a sum of  between &pound;25,000 and &pound;30,000 from a rate base of &pound;25 million. It should be  remembered that most councils already contribute to festivals; therefore, it  will be relatively easy for them to provide match funding.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, it will be for councils to decide whether to take  advantage of the funding that is on offer, and funding will be redistributed to those councils who wish to avail  of it. I am minded to skew such a redistribution &mdash; if it takes place, because some councils do not see the value of community festivals &mdash; to areas that have  taken the greatest amount of festival funding in the past.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, which again shows that the Assembly, at  ministerial level, is delivering for local communities. Today&rsquo;s announcement is  good news.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister confirm that the community festivals fund  will be spread across the 26 council areas? Ards Borough Council has received  no funding in the past either through community festival funding or directly  from the Government. There are many community festivals in the Ards borough and  other events, such as the Ballygrafton Horse Trials and the BASC Northern  Ireland Games Fair, as well as the Twelfth of July celebrations, which,  collectively, have the potential to bring a lot of people to the area. Has TSN  been applied to each of the council areas? If so, will the Minister confirm  that Ards Borough Council will be the recipient of financial assistance from  the community festivals fund?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Yes, I can confirm that the TSN criteria have been applied and that Ards  Borough Council will benefit. I have no doubt that the Member will be very  quick to inform groups about the opportunities that may exist &mdash; I know him  quite well. His colleague from Strangford Mr McNarry asked how much money would  be going to the Ards area. If Ards Borough Council is prepared to provide match  funding, &pound;18,000 will be provided by the Department. Match funding will raise  that sum to &pound;36,000, to be distributed in an area in which, previously, no  money was distributed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This is a great opportunity for many areas across Northern Ireland  &mdash; five council areas, three of which are unionist and two of which are  nationalist &mdash; to benefit from festival funding. I think that that is good for  the people of Northern    Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his statement,  but I do not know whether I welcome it because some issues need to be further  teased out.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In one of his remarks,  the Minister said that if council areas do not take up the offer of  match funding, festivals in those areas will not receive funding. That is a  flaw. I am not sure whether the Minister has spoken to all the councils. If he  has not done so, that is also a flaw and it must be addressed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the  Minister mentioned F&eacute;ile an Phobail at the start of his statement. Like  him. I recognise the importance of that festival. In earlier comments, the  Minister stated that some groups may be being hindered and restricted as  regards funding because they have been organising for many years and funding  has been reduced. That issue needs to be addressed also. Some of the most  important festivals have had their funding restricted over the years &mdash; by half  on some occasions.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member please ask his question?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Has the Minister discussed the issue with all the councils?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: We  have not discussed the issue with the 26 councils, although we have spoken to  NILGA representatives. Through the review of public administration, we have  consulted local authorities, and it was clearly identified that  community-festival funding would come under their remit, as is stated in the  emerging findings paper.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to match funding, this is a tremendous  opportunity to ensure that festivals are expanded, not diminished. Councils  must not use these moneys to replace moneys that had previously been allocated  to festivals. Councils have a chance to enhance festivals, with only a modest  impact on their rates base.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Will the  Minister acknowledge the fact that, historically, cultural festivals have been driven from a narrow  culture base? How does he intend to ensure an equitable distribution of  future community-festival funding? Will criteria be established to ensure  consistency across councils? To what extent  will the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure be involved in  overseeing the fund?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure will set the overarching policy and  guidance framework, which will outline broad  criteria for funding festivals. However, councils will have considerable  flexibility in determining their own processes and detailed criteria. The  Department will issue letters of offer to each council, monitor how the funds  are drawn down and ask local authorities to publish their assess&shy;ment criteria,  application processes and procedures for making awards. Local authorities will  have control over funding decisions and  funding levels. I am confident that no one is better placed than public  representatives on local authorities to gear festival funding towards local  community needs. I am also confident that our local councillors will identify  the projects that are best suited to, and most beneficial for, their areas.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and the proposals that will allow local  authorities to deliver community-festival funding. Will the Minister assure the  House that measures will be put in place to ensure that groups that do not come  from the majority section of a local community will receive fair access to that  funding?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  All equality provisions and safeguards that apply to local authority decisions  will also apply to community-festival funding. I am sure that, if a local  authority discriminates against people on the basis of their being members of a  minority group, the local community will make its voice clearly heard. It is not in the best interests of a local authority to  discriminate against any section of  a community. In recent years, there has not been much evidence of that  happening, and I trust that that will continue to be the case.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister  for his statement, but I do not welcome its  content. The Benches opposite have missed the point entirely; there is  not enough money for community-festival funding. I declare an interest, because  I am a director of F&eacute;ile an Phobail, and I thank the Minister for his  complimentary remarks about that f&eacute;ile, which he recognises as being one of the  largest. In recent years, funding for that f&eacute;ile has been slashed, and the  community festival fund owes it &pound;30,000. We are now in a situation where  &pound;450,000 will be available for 40 community festivals. Can the Minister tell  the House whether there are guarantees to ensure that local councils will match  funding? Will efforts be made to increase funding? Will the community festival  fund repay the &pound;30,000 that is owed to F&eacute;ile an Phobail?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  cannot guarantee what individual local authorities in Northern Ireland  will do &mdash; thankfully, for everyone, I do not have that authority. Ultimately,  Members will seek to influence their local authorities in the best interests of  their communities. I do not think that there is a strong case for anyone not to  accept the funding being offered, provide match funding and create the best  opportunities for their communities to develop festivals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The West Belfast Festival has been very successful, and its  success should lead to more private-funding streams. As that festival moves  towards receiving more private-sector  funding, having demonstrated its success, opportunities can be created  for new festivals on the basis of the funding being distributed across Northern  Ireland &mdash; west of the Bann; east of the Bann; in nationalist and in unionist  areas. My Department is not discriminating  against people; funding is being allocated on the basis of population  and deprivation, and this is an opportunity for everyone to get a slice of the  cake. The larger festivals have the capacity to move forward, and, hopefully,  smaller festivals will come on stream that  can also move forward and benefit from the funding that might not have  been available to them previously.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  thank the Minister, and I welcome his statement. He will be aware that this  year&rsquo;s Belfast Festival at Queen&rsquo;s was very successful and attracted many  visitors to Northern Ireland.  Will he assure me that that festival will continue to get funding through  today&rsquo;s announcement?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I am looking at a different mechanism of funding for the  Belfast Festival at Queen&rsquo;s. As the Member is aware, the festival is arts-based  and already receives funding from the Arts Council, and I hope that the Arts  Council will continue to fund the festival.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There was some pressure, particular this year, on the  festival, and there was concern about it. First, I hope that there will not be  any concern about the Belfast Festival at Queen&rsquo;s continuing &mdash; I want to remove  any uncertainty about that. Secondly, I want to see the festival expanding, and  I will both work with the private sector  and ensure that public money is main&shy;tained to grow the festival and make it an even more significant event  that will bring huge benefits to the community.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the establishment of objective  criteria; the Minister is approaching the issue from the right direction.  Despite the progress that we can record in our communities, some comments from  the Minister&rsquo;s own Benches reflect a shared concern about how the policy will  apply in individual council areas. It should be acknowledged that there have  been problems in some council areas. Will the Minister outline the checks and  balances that will accompany the regulations to ensure that a fair and  equitable approach is taken?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: As  the Member is aware, the equality regulations that apply to local authorities  will continue to apply in this case.  Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and other equality measures  will help to ensure that funding will be distributed on an equitable basis and  that people are not discriminated against. Ultimately, local authorities will  draw up the criteria.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I do not get the feeling, nor have I for a long  time, that local authorities are out to discriminate against sections of their  own communities. Local authorities are  there to serve their communities, and they do so well. Those who suggest  that local authorities may choose to discriminate against their communities in  some shape or form do not reflect their true nature. It is a somewhat  disparaging suggestion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and his commitment to the shared future  initiative. However, he referred to the Belfast F&eacute;ile, which began some 20  years ago, as one of the oldest community festivals in Northern Ireland.  I inform the House that the Portaferry Gala, which is held annually in my  constituency in the second week of July, has just celebrated its fortieth  birthday, and it gets better every year. Any Member of the House who has not  been to the gala is more than welcome to come this year.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: Will the Member <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">come  to the question?</span></span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Indeed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In his statement, the Minister acknowledges that most of  the festivals in question are run by community volunteers, and the acquisition  of funds is vital to their activities. Can the Minister assure the House that,  by handing over the funding of community festivals to local councils, and  taking into account the future amalgamation of councils, festival organisers  will not be disadvantaged or squeezed out from receiving sufficient funds,  because the new larger councils will be further removed from local communities?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Perhaps the Member should refer that question to the Minister of the Environment,  who was sitting beside me a moment ago, because part of her Department&rsquo;s remit  is to ensure that, when the new local authorities are established &mdash; and they  may not be as large as Mr McCarthy thinks, although that remains to be seen &mdash;  they take cognisance of those communities that are smaller or are on the  periphery of the council areas. Much responsibility falls to the local  representatives, and, if they state their communities&rsquo; case strongly and  cogently, I am sure that their council colleagues will listen.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the  Minister&rsquo;s statement and particularly his commitment to giving local government  a greater role. As a local councillor, I declare an interest. Will the Minister  leave a provision for those councils that may not have community structures in  place to avail of the new community festival fund? Last year, local councillors  in Dungannon found that sufficient funding was not available for the Flight of  the Earls festival, given that it is a sizeable event. It is important that  local government has the facility to fund such events.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Councils must develop funding criteria. The community festival fund is, by its  very nature, community-based. However, if  it is a matter of reaching out to communities and working in conjunction  with them, with the council taking the lead, my Department will examine  establishing criteria for that. There will be overarching policy guidelines,  but the Department is prepared to work with local authorities on the development  of their criteria. If that best meets the needs of a particular area, it can be  considered.</p>
		    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair"><strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt; font-style:normal; ">Outline  of a Vision &nbsp;for our Education System</span></strong></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Education that she wishes to make a  statement on the outline of a vision for our education system.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a Cheann Comhairle. When the Administration came into being on 8  May 2007, Ministers in the Executive from every Department faced unique  challenges and opportunities. Local Ministers who are accountable to local  people are now taking decisions. Unlike under direct rule, local Ministers are  accessible, available and, most importantly, working on the ground. One of the  principal &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I will take the point of order after the Minister&rsquo;s statement.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the principal challenges facing education has been  the need to reform a system that was constructed more than 60 years ago and  that is still in place today. For decades, successive Education Ministers  talked about dealing with the issue of the 11-plus &mdash; and for decades, all we  have got is talk.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2002, Martin McGuinness, in his capacity as Minister of  Education, announced the end of the 11-plus.  We now have an opportunity to truly transform our system into one that  is world class and fit for the twenty-first century. In recent months, I have  spoken to teachers, parents, pupils and administrators, and there is a real  appetite out there to embrace change, to improve our system and to end the  two-tier culture that brands so many of our young people as failures at the age  of 11.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I relish the challenge of transforming our outdated and  unequal education system into a modern, flexible one that places equality of  opportunity for every child at its core. Such a system will not only continue  to deliver academic excellence for the few but can deliver it for all. That is  what local decision-making is all about. The previous lack of local  accountability is one of the reasons why no action was taken to change a system  that was put in place in the late 1940s and that is still expected to deliver  for our children in 2007.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This is an Executive with an agenda for change at its core:  this is an Executive that has been mandated to transform our society for the  better. As I proceed in carrying out the changes to our education system,  equality is my watchword; equality of access and equality of educational  opportunity. I plan to bring our education system into the twenty-first century  and lay down a foundation that will ensure educational excellence and greater  participation in the future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My proposals are ambitious. They require further work at a  detailed level, but the direction in which I wish to travel is now clear, and  the time is right to share that with you.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Central to the 1947  education system, through which children in today&rsquo;s primary schools are  still being processed, has been the 11-plus transfer test. Following  consultation on the Burns Report, Martin McGuinness announced the ending of the  transfer test in 2002. Subsequently, direct rule Minister Jane Kennedy  announced that the final transfer test would be held in 2008. That means that  the final children to transfer under the existing system will commence post-primary  school in September 2009. The Education (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 causes  the current admissions arrangements to lapse for September 2010 admissions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is the context in which I have been focused; the  creation and delivery of a fundamentally exciting new vision for the education  system in the North. The changes proposed  will, with proper planning and effective implementation, have an immediate and positive effect. I have  written to my Executive colleagues outlining my  vision and I have briefed the Education Committee. I was to have a  meeting with the Chairperson of the Committee for Education, but he did not  make it, as he was held up in traffic. However, he will be glad to know that  under my new arrangements there will be less traffic on the road, and children  will no longer pass each other on buses. My colleague Conor Murphy will also be  delighted with that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have reflected long and hard on what has been said to me  over the past six months. Additionally, I have taken detailed and considered account  of the changing environment in which our  education system is expected to  function. I am conscious that the debate on education has become  narrowly focused on the contentious issue of academic selection as the basis  for transferring to the post-primary sector. That narrow focus by sectoral  interests has been a matter of considerable concern to me because the debate is  really about delivering a vision for a world-class education system reflecting  the needs of all our children equally.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am an advocate for dynamic and effective change in  education. Today, I am outlining a clear vision that moves us all beyond the outdated concept of the two-tier education system that has failed so many of our  children.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Such a system will have to provide our children with the  life skills required for today&rsquo;s complex, rapidly transforming, socially  changing and globalised world. That system must also provide children with the  qualifications and skills required in a modern and dynamic economy. The  blue-collar and white-collar world has gone, and with it the primary rationale  for a two-gear post-primary system. It is imperative that we develop a more  flexible and agile post-primary system. Surely, in 2007, we can develop  sophisticated models of school organisation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The reformed post-primary system that I am outlining will,  quite properly, have to take account of the full reform agenda that is already  affecting the education system in the North. For example, the revised  curriculum is being introduced over the next three years. The entitle&shy;ment  framework within the curriculum will introduce new and exciting opportunities  for our young people. Before and after GCSE, we envisage access to a broad  range of academic, professional and technical courses.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have seen the revised curriculum, which is being  delivered in classrooms across the North, beginning to work. Teachers are  energised by the revised curriculum and children are stimulated by it, and that  combination is helping to ensure that our children get the best possible  education. Those changes will be supported by the significant reform of  education administration and the establishment of the education and skills  authority. The development of area-based planning will play a key role in that.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite agam roimhe sa Tion&oacute;l go mbeinn s&aacute;sta molta&iacute; a thabhairt chun  tosaigh at&aacute; d&iacute;rithe ar a chinnti&uacute; go mbeidh f&aacute;il chothrom ag gach p&aacute;iste ar an  oideachas iarbhunscola&iacute;ochta is fearr. T&aacute; s&eacute; l&eacute;irithe agam freisin go  dtabharfaidh m&eacute; chun tosaigh molta&iacute; chun an c&oacute;ras oideachais a mh&uacute;nl&uacute; ar leasa  an ph&aacute;iste in &aacute;it an p&aacute;iste a mh&uacute;nl&uacute; ar leasa institi&uacute;ide oideachais &eacute;igin.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On several occasions, I have stated in the Chamber that I  would bring forward proposals aimed at ensuring that all the children in this  society have equal access to high-quality post-primary education. I have also  made it abundantly clear that I will bring forward proposals to mould the  system around the interests of the child, instead of a system that matches the  child to the interests of a particular educational institution. That is the  direction in which the Department will proceed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Children and parents  must be able to have confidence that their local post-primary schools  will offer the quality and depth of educational provision that they want, need  and deserve. I am determined that my Department  &mdash; in partnership with all educationalists &mdash; will ensure that every school is a good one, is sustainable and  has a clear focus on high standards. That is why I have brought forward my  revised school-improvement policy, &lsquo;Every School a Good School&rsquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I intend to mobilise and co-ordinate the resources at my  disposal to build a modern and flexible education system, which moves us away  from the outdated 1947 institutional model that divides children aged 11 years into just two school types &mdash; grammar and  non-grammar.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A twenty-first century model will transform that unequal  and outdated approach by matching children of all aptitudes to the full breadth  of provision that they want, need and deserve to fulfil their maximum potential  as citizens and members of society. However, the key principle that underpins  the new model of educational provision will be equality. No longer will any  child be at a disadvantage because their parents cannot afford tuition or  coaching, and no longer will the potential of any citizen be undermined  because, as a small child, aged 11 years, he or she fell through the cracks of an  unequal two-tier system that was born 60 years ago.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Geallaim don Teach inniu go mbeidh cearta comhionanna gach  p&aacute;iste ag cro&iacute;l&aacute;r an ch&oacute;rais &uacute;ir. My pledge today is that the equal rights of  all children will be at the heart of the new system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During the past six months, I have been told that we have  the best education system in the world. Undoubtedly, the capacity of our  education system to deliver high-quality academic excellence is widely &mdash; and  correctly &mdash; celebrated. However, regardless of the selective presentation of  figures for the academic achievement of one section of our children, the cold  reality is that the system still fails a high proportion of our young people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A system that does well for some and does not deliver for  the rest is unacceptable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am the Minister of Education for all children. I cannot &mdash;  and will not &mdash; ignore the fact that every year 4,000 young people leave school  after 12 years of compulsory education without the appropriate basic literacy and numeracy skills. I believe that it is  possible to develop a system that will not only continue to deliver  academic excellence for the few but will deliver it for all.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To those &mdash; particularly on the unionist Benches &mdash; who still  believe that our system is not broken, I <strong>ask</strong>:  look at the situation in many working-class areas. Unionist working-class  communities such as the lower Shankill, Mount Vernon and Tigers Bay  have been left behind, and many are completely disconnected with the education  system before they reach the age of 16. The same can be said for many  working-class nationalist communities whether they are in the Falls,  Downpatrick, Strabane or Derry. That is the  reality; and it is a reality that I am not prepared to stand by and allow to  continue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; m&eacute; ag iarraidh c&oacute;ras oideachais a chumadh ina mbeidh  f&aacute;il ag gach p&aacute;iste ar r&eacute;imse cothrom de roghanna ardchaighde&aacute;in sna point&iacute;  critic&uacute;la ina bhforbairt oideachas&uacute;il. Creidim gurb &eacute; ceithre bliana d&eacute;ag an  aois is critic&uacute;la.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me be very clear; I am not advocating a  one-size-fits-all system. Rather, I am seeking to devise an education system in  which all children will enjoy access to an equal range of high-quality choices  at the critical junction points in their  educational development, the most significant of which is at age 14.  That will involve building a system that will sustain a range of schools and  provision and that will value all of them equally. We want to retain everything  that is good about our current system &mdash; including academic excellence &mdash; and  improve on its performance so that it will cater for the needs of all our young  people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Making fundamental educational determinations for children  at the age of 11 is wrong; and such decisions, for most children, become  irreversible. By moving the point of transition to age 14 and by introducing  more flexibility and agility into the structures, we will make it possible for  the transformed education system to facilitate the deserved and diverse needs  of children &mdash; reversing the negative demand of slotting children into a system  that has historically branded some as failures and others as, potentially,  successes. The key point is not that academic selection is unjust, but that it  is unnecessary and unjust. I firmly believe that we can collectively deliver  all the benefits of academic excellence without the trauma of academic  selection at the age of 10 or 11.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In my vision, young people will enjoy equal access to their  post-14 educational pathway in a number <strong>of  ways, as determined by the planning of education in their local areas. They  will include</strong>: access within an 11-19 school; transfer to an alternative  11-19 school; access through an 11-19 school or a post-14 school, which offers the entitlement framework in  collaboration with other schools in a learning community. A local area  may offer general provision in 11-14 schools followed  by specialism and diversity in 14-plus provision.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">An academic pathway will remain that will be accessed by  intelligent, well-informed and mature election and available through modern,  organisational flexibility. Testing is not the best way to inform admissions  decisions at 14 about a young person&rsquo;s educational and career pathway. Such  decisions should be based on a process of formal, structured election: it will  take account of the outcomes of three years of post-primary education and  teacher and parental guidance, in addition to careers education, information,  advice and guidance resulting in the matching of children to suitable  provision. Contrast that with the way in which our current system approaches  matching pupils to provision &mdash; by using two one-hour tests sat by 10- to  11-year-olds to determine entrance to one of two types of school.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Through the entitlement  framework, academic courses can be well integrated with challenging  professional and/or technical courses, providing a much better base for many future third-level entrants, which is more  properly tailored to the requirements of a modern economy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That framework will also ensure the capacity to deliver  high-quality professional and/or technical pathways, accessed by choice,  available through modern organisational flexibility, and, above all, enjoying  parity of esteem.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some may criticise the structural change that my vision may  entail. However, it is a fact that structural change will be required, regardless  of my approach to post-primary education. After 10 years of dramatically  falling pupil numbers, we have an increasing problem with school sustainability  and surplus places, resulting in 50,000 empty desks &mdash; and that figure will  increase over the coming years.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Structural reform is unavoidable. George Bain&rsquo;s independent  review is clear about that. Far from being a matter of unnecessary structural  change, it is a matter of embracing the  massive potential that this opportunity offers us to modernise our service  provision and education system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Structural change need not mean vast amounts of new  capacity. By reorganising the existing capacity within the framework of my  vision for education, I intend to deliver not only effective education, but  efficient education. For example, extended  access to professional, technical, general and academic courses could be  achieved through the process of school and further education collaborations,  and the careful management of the schools estate at a time of falling school numbers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; an dr&eacute;achtChl&aacute;r Rialtais soil&eacute;ir sa mh&eacute;id seo, n&oacute; dearbha&iacute;onn s&eacute; go mbeidh na focail  &ldquo;cothroime&rdquo;, &ldquo;cuimsi&uacute;&rdquo; agus &ldquo;comhionannas&rdquo; mar fhocail faire ag an  Choiste Feidhmi&uacute;ch&aacute;in agus &eacute; ag sol&aacute;thar a chuid polasaithe agus ina chl&aacute;r.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Programme for Government is explicit in declaring  that the watchwords of the Executive, in delivering all its policies and  programmes, will be fairness, inclusion and equality.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The 1947 education system, which encompasses a post-primary  transfer system that brands 11-year-old children as failures, is not fair,  inclusive or equal. Because of that, it is my intention, following a period of  consultation, to bring forward regulations governing the operation of  post-primary transfer for 2010, and for the subsequent interim period before  the implementation of a 14-plus system of election.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There will be no 11-plus transfer test in the 2009-10  school year. Pupils transferring to post-primary school in September 2010 will  do so overwhelmingly on the basis of  preference for certain schools, in much the same way that primary  schools and preschools are chosen now. From 2010, the criteria will include  community, geography and family.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am conscious that many grammar schools have been  admitting a wide ability range for some years now, and will receive all their  pupils in September 2010 without regard to academic assessment. Some grammar  schools may need some time and assistance to adjust to the new system that I  have outlined today, and, in my forthcoming discussions with them, I hope to be  able to reach an agreed way forward to facilitate that transition. I hope that  all grammar schools will see a positive future for the continuation of academic  excellence in my vision for education. If any school, however, chooses to  operate independent admission arrangements that lie outside the new system of  transfer, I want to make it clear that there is no obligation on my Department  to assist with funding.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the transfer from primary to  post-primary education be as seamless as possible. I am confident that we can  find the best way forward to meet the needs of all our children, based on a  vision that places quality educational outcomes and equality of educational  opportunities for each and every child at its epicentre.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Next year will be the last year of the 11-plus. There will be no 11-plus in 2009, nor will I be asking  primary school educators to ever again disrupt or interfere with the  teaching of the revised curriculum in furtherance of a transfer test.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Children in year 5, their parents and their teachers can  now focus on the job in hand &mdash; educating our young people and concentrating on  the curriculum in a way that allows each and every child an equal opportunity  to fulfil his or her full potential as citizens in the future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise the  critical role that principals and teachers will play in implementing my  proposals, and I know that we will work together in the best interests of our  children and young people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have outlined today how we  are to proceed in the years ahead. Let the construction of a new  education system now begin. This is no longer a debate about the merits of  academic selection. My focus now is on delivering a world-class education  system for all our children. I ask Members to join with me in building that  education system, which will benefit everyone. I believe that these proposals  offer us the road map to get there. Tos&oacute;imid anois ar an obair th&aacute;bhachtach  seo.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. It is my  understanding that, where a matter is of significance or where there are  important cross-cutting issues, it should first be brought to the Executive.  Can you give a ruling on whether it is appropriate for the Minister to bring  this significant issue to the Floor of the House without having first brought  it to the Executive?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I am responsible for ensuring that business in the House is conducted within  Standing Orders. The Minister&rsquo;s only requirement in Standing Orders is that not  less than two and a half hours&rsquo; notice of a statement is given to the Speaker.  That requirement was met by the Minister of Education yesterday. I also  understand that the Whips were contacted immediately.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Further to that point of order, will Mr McCrea confirm whether the Ulster  Unionist Party is a member of the Executive?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That is not an appropriate point of order. I call Lord Morrow for a further  point of order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Will Sinn F&eacute;in confirm whether it intends to  discuss this matter seriously?</p>

		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. If there is doubt that a section of the  Minister&rsquo;s statement is inaccurate, should it not be brought to your attention?  The Minister said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I have written to my Executive colleagues outlining  my vision and I have briefed the Education Committee.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When did the Minister write to her Executive colleagues?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I hope that Lord Morrow will be able to put that question to the Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker, as a ministerial colleague, I did not receive any  corres&shy;&shy;pondence from the Minister. I informed my Executive colleagues  that I intended to make a statement on community festival funding, and I gave  them a week to respond. The Minister has  not given us the same privilege. She should realise that she will not be  able to implement such policies &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I say to all sides of the House, I am not responsible for Executive  protocols and who enforces them. As the Speaker, I am here to protect the House  and its protocols, and that is as far as my responsibility goes.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. In respect of what you have just outlined, and  in deep appreciation of it, the House finds itself in a similar position to  when the Minister for Social Development took a step that resulted in a legal  question being asked about her actions, to the extent that I cannot talk about the  issue because it is sub judice. Is it in your interests to rule that, in the  interests of the House, there may be legal complications about the Minister&rsquo;s  statement and that the House should reflect on that?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have already said that I received notification of the Minister&rsquo;s statement  yesterday. The Minister has followed all  protocols, and my responsibility ends with that. Whatever happens within  the Executive happens within the Executive,  and it is for them to resolve.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My main duty is to protect the House and its procedures,  and that is what I have done this morning.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I call Mr Sammy Wilson to ask the Minister a  question, I advise Members that there is a full list of people who also wish to  ask questions. Therefore, I ask Members to refrain from making speeches and to  keep their questions short and to the point. By doing so, they will increase  their colleagues&rsquo; chances of asking a question.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: I thank the Minister for  prior know&shy;ledge of her statement, which  she made available to me before the  sitting. I understand that some of her Executive colleagues may not feel  the same way. I apologise for that, because it is perhaps due to the fact that  I rushed her into making today&rsquo;s statement in advance of the motion that is  tabled for next week.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As usual, the  Minister&rsquo;s statement contains a plateful of platitudes but only a spoonful of substance. Therefore, I  have several questions, and, given that the Minister has had from May to  contemplate the matter, I trust that we will get some answers from her this  morning, rather than being told that we must wait until the consultation period  is over.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">First, given that there will be a gap between the old and  new arrangements, between 2008 and 2011, how will the Minister reassure school  principals and parents about what will happen during that period?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, after 2011, how will places be allocated if  schools are oversubscribed?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, given that the Minister emphasises the  geographical context of transfers, how will she ensure that her vision of  equality and fairness will be met and that people will not simply buy a house  close to the school to which they wish to send their children?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that significant structural changes will  be necessary. What will those changes entail? How many schools that currently  accept pupils aged 11 to 18 will be required to change in order to accept  children aged 11 to 14 or children aged 14 to 18? How much will those  structural changes cost?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, given that the Minister has ignored the political  reality that such changes require cross-community support, as well as ignoring  the views of 70% of the public, 65% of teachers, and half of the House, how  does she intend to get those proposals through the House?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Go raibh maith agat  le haghaidh na ceiste sin. First, I confirm  that I sent a letter to all my Executive colleagues, and it might be  wise for Executive members to check with their officials &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Minister has the Floor. Give her some order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: On  a previous occasion, when I sent a letter to the Minister of Culture, Arts, and  Leisure, he wrote back to say that he had not received it, but subsequently  confirmed that he had. Executive members will find that the letter has been  sent.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Sammy Wilson for his comments. I am disappointed  that we did not have a chance to talk this morning; nonetheless, his comments  are welcome.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There will always be popular and oversubscribed schools. We  must ensure that every school is a good school, with good leadership, and that  children attend the nearest local school.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On the question about a postcode lottery &mdash; what do we have  at the moment? We have a life lottery in which we are playing with our  children&rsquo;s lives using two one-hour tests. Is that fair? Is that right? I  believe that it is fundamentally wrong that generations of our young people  have been put through two one-hour tests, which amount to a life lottery.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to build a new vision of an education system. We  need to transform our education system for every child. I welcome the fact that  young people are here today. For the first time, they will be at the centre of  the decision-making.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For the first time, their voices are going to be heard. It  will not be other people &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  For the first time &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am answering the question. For the first time, it will  not be other people making decisions for them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to geographical &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, Members. Allow the Minister to answer.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  She is not answering the question.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: I am not responsible for how a Minister answers a question.  Members ought to know that.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  On a point of order &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  No points of order will be taken. The Minister is on her feet. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Member to take his seat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Is there a time limit as to how long the Minister can take to answer a  question?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I was actually asked aon, dh&aacute;, tr&iacute;, ceithre, c&uacute;ig, s&eacute;  ceisteanna. I was asked six questions, and I am answering the six questions. I  want to go through the questions that I was asked by the Cathaoirleach &mdash; the  Chairperson &mdash; of the Committee for Education.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Regarding the geographical issue, I am bringing forward a  school-improvement policy in which every school will be a good school.  Regarding structural change and cost, to paraphrase Oscar Wilde, it appears  that some politicians in the Assembly know:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the price of everything, and the value of nothing.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I intend to deliver not only effective education,  but efficient education. Structural change need not mean vast amounts of new  capacity, but, rather, by the reorganisation of existing capacity and the careful  management of the schools estate &mdash; at a time of falling pupil numbers &mdash; we will  be able to deliver a better education system, which is the most important thing  that we can do for our children. What price do we put on our children&rsquo;s  education?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will be consulting on my proposals, and, as a Minister, I  will comply with all my requirements and duties. I want to find the way  forward. Political consensus is important to me, as is the agreement of parents, teachers, children and  educational admin&shy;istrators. We will have many discussions about our  vision for education, and I look forward to those discussions with people from  every political creed.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il  leis an Aire agus taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt di &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Is it appropriate for one Member to refer to  another as a &ldquo;lapdog&rdquo;?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I am not taking points of order during questions to the Minister. I will be  happy to do so afterwards.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Maith th&uacute;, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane for her statement. This  is a historic and momentous day for our education system. The statement is good  for children, parents, and the education system. It sets out a vision for  transforming the education system from one which has been dominated by academic  selection to one in which academic excellence will be achieved. The new system  will give every child and young person an opportunity to leave school with  qualifications. The best education system is one that caters for, and gives  opportunities to, all children.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has said that key decisions will be taken at  the age of 14, rather than, as now, selection at 11. Will that fundamental  change to the education system result in children being better equipped to make  those choices at 14, and able to select a pathway by which they can leave the  education system and go into the workforce?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, Paul. There is broad consensus among educationalists that age  14 is a key decision point for young people. Under the current system, that is  the age at which young people make important decisions about their courses of  study and future career pathways.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At 11, pupils have not completed their formative core  curriculum, and dividing them into academic and non-academic categories by two  one-hour tests &mdash; or, indeed, by any other means &mdash; lacks educational  justification.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">An individual&rsquo;s decision on his or her post-14 pathway  should be taken within a framework of choice and flexibility, informed by  parents, teachers and the career strategy that Reg Empey, the Minister for  Employment and Learning, and I have jointly  put out to consultation. Ask any young person today what they like, what  they are good at, what they want to do more of and what they want to do less  of. Informed, mature election at the age of  14 is the way forward, and many educationalists will agree with that.  There is consensus in the House around that.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Does the Minister accept that, had she come to the House and asked for more  resources for early-years education to help tackle educational  underachievement, she would have had its full support? Had she talked of  increasing parental choice and effort, or asked for more resources for under&shy;performing  schools, she would have had the full support of all Members. Is it not somewhat  ironic that, instead, someone who chastises the high-stakes, winner-takes-all  approach has brought measures to the House that are confrontational, do not  build consensus and are unlikely to help?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Instead of tackling the issues that she brings &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Where is the question?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Minister undertake to fully involve the House and give it an  opportunity to debate her proposals? She does not have the support of this half  of the House or of the people of Northern Ireland. She will destroy  the education system. This will be the ruination of &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  went before the electorate with our policies in relation to academic selection.  I have been out and about in every part of the North of Ireland over the past  six months. I have met people and visited many different areas; I have met  school principals, from every community, who are crying out for change. We are  debating the proposals now, and we will have many more debates, which I look  forward to, as I look forward to working with all Members in building a new,  dynamic education system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member described the present system as world-class: I  do not accept that. Pupil numbers are falling dramatically. Each year we fill  grammar schools with an increasingly mixed-ability intake, and we leave many of  the rest of our children to suffer the consequences of shrinking, unsustainable  and potentially failing schools. That is despite the best efforts of principals  in those schools. Our 69 grammar schools represent 30% of the 229 post-primary  schools, but they now educate 42% of post-primary pupils, and the latest NISRA  (Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency) figures show that in 2013-14,  that will be 45%. Our system is changing negatively and drifting. I am looking  to galvanise it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said, I am not prepared to allow the system to  continue to fail young people throughout the North. It is unfair. It is unfair  to working-class communities, and it is not good for our economy or for the  development of life skills among young people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have to move forward. We cannot put our heads in the  sand and pretend that there is no problem. There are difficulties here, but we now have the opportunity to change. It is a unique opportunity. Instead of  squabbling, let us move forward together and build the world-class  education system that some think we have now.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. T&aacute; c&uacute;pla ceist agam don Aire. Is it  not the case that the age of 14 was suggested as pivotal by the DUP at the  Programme for Government Committee&rsquo;s Subgroup to Consider the Schools Admission  Policy? After becoming Minister of Education, Ms Ruane abandoned the  recommendations of the Costello Report, initiated by her colleague Mr  McGuinness, and went along with the DUP&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, what plans does the Minister have to ensure  that pathways that are chosen at the age of 14 genuinely reflect the ability  and aptitude of pupils, rather than primarily coinciding with social and  economic advantage? How can she reassure the public that the new system will  not replicate the worst effects of academic selection and social disadvantage?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  have given the reasons that explain why 14 is a key age to choose a pathway,  and I have stated that there is consensus on that among all parties, not just  the DUP. The Member sat on the Committee that discussed that matter, and the  consensus was that 14 is a key age for young people to make decisions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We will do everything possible to ensure that every child  is given a fair chance. We will ensure that every child&rsquo;s needs are met within  our education system, and that they are matched to suitable provision. However,  choice is a key principle &mdash; young people know what they want, along with their  teachers, career advisers and parents. There is a much better way to make  decisions than the one that was used in the past. We do not need academic  selection at 11, or 14, to make decisions. Young people and their parents can  do that, helped by the good careers guidance that is crucial to those  decisions.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: The  Alliance Party broadly welcomes the Minister&rsquo;s statement, as far as it goes. It  is a vision statement, so we shall await concrete proposals. On the last page  of the Minister&rsquo;s statement, there is a reference to what would happen if  grammar schools opt for independent admission arrangements:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;If any school, however, chooses to operate  independent admission arrangements that lie outside the new system of transfer,  I want to make it clear that there is no obligation on my Department to assist  with funding.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For those of us who like things to be absolutely clear, is  the effect of the statement that there is no obligation on the Department to assist  with funding related purely to the setting up and administration of those  tests, or is there an implied threat to the funding of grammar schools?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister comfortable with the proposed timescale?  2011 may appear to be far away, but that is no time, and to work within that  short timescale will be an achievement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the statement, reference is made to the develop&shy;ment of  area-based planning, which plays a key role and which the Alliance Party  welcomes, but how will that be developed within the proposed timescale?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, to repeat a question that has been asked by two  Members, but which has not yet been answered: do the Minister&rsquo;s proposals  require cross-community support or not?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  The transfer of the majority of children in the North will occur as it has  always done. Most children transfer on the basis of non-academic criteria. I  intend to discuss with grammar schools my proposals to move beyond the 1947  selective system, and I am committed to persuading them that academic selection  is no more necessary to enable children to have access to an academic  education, than vocational selection is necessary to enable children to have  access to professional and technical courses.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that some grammar schools may need time to adjust to an intake that is based on  non-academic criteria &mdash; the system to  which I am committed. There&shy;fore, I am keen to explore with those schools  transitional arrangements that build  on existing practice. In the new year,  I shall make a further statement on progress towards an agreement for  transfer arrangements in 2010. On securing the agreement, I will prepare draft  regulations to underpin it, and I will bring that to the Committee for  Education, and the Executive, for consideration.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If any school chooses  to operate independent admission arrangements  that lie outside the new system of transfer, I want to make it clear  that there is no obligation on my Department to assist with funding.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I do not welcome the fact that the Minister has come to the  House with proposals that add to the confusion that already exists. She said  that her proposals will:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;require further work at a detailed level before a  number of questions can be answered&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Therefore, the Minister is not even in a position  to answer questions in the House. If the statement was as well prepared as the  one that she made on the amal&shy;gamation of two schools in my constituency &mdash; St  Joseph&rsquo;s Primary School in Ahoghill and St Patrick&rsquo;s Primary School in  Aughtercloney &mdash; in which she made a fundamental error that is now being  reviewed, there will be serious consequences for the announce&shy;ment that she has  made today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister state how she intends to deal with her  proposals in a legislative framework? Has she any plans to consult with parents,  whom she ignores, and their children, for whom she alleges that she has a  conscience? I do not know from where Sinn F&eacute;in has suddenly got its conscience  about children. Will the Minister tell the House what plans she has to consult  with parents, so that Members know exactly how parents have reacted to her  proposals? When will flesh be put on the bones of the skeleton proposals that  the Minister has put forward?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: At  present, there is confusion and mess &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  There is confusion and mess amid dramatically falling pupil numbers. I will  repeat what I have already said, because I do not believe that the Member heard  me. Each year, grammar schools are filled with an increasingly mixed-ability  intake. Many other children are left to suffer the consequences of shrinking,  unsustainable and potentially failing schools. Our 69 grammar schools represent  30% of the 229 post-primary schools. However, they educate 42% of post-primary pupils. I want to galvanise that  provision. I have made proposals that will fundamentally change the  system and improve it for all children, by matching them to suitable provision  rather than to institutions.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Minister answer the question?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  am answering the Member&rsquo;s question. The programme of change will be structured,  phased in over several years and locally developed. Of course, parents will be  part of that, as will teachers, trade unions, different education sectors and  the various Churches. Everyone in society has a stake in this, and it is  essential that all their voices be heard.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement,  not least because I am the parent of a child who is due to transfer to  post-primary education in 2010. However, I welcome it not only on my child&rsquo;s  behalf but on behalf of all children, who have the right not to be deemed  failures at a young age.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister confirm that she will ensure that those  excellent rural primary schools that are not, at present, in close proximity to  secondary schools will not be adversely affected by what many people describe  as a &ldquo;postcode lottery&rdquo;?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat. I understand the Member&rsquo;s concerns. However, I can assure her  that the vision that I have outlined will  ensure that her concerns do not come to pass. As I said in my statement,  pupils who transfer to post-primary education in September 2010 will do so  overwhelmingly on the basis of their preference of school, in much the same way  in which children&rsquo;s parents choose their primary schools and preschools at  present.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The permitted criteria that are issued to schools include  family, community and geographical details. A section that deals with feeder  primary schools is contained in the community and geographical criteria. The  quicker that the move is made towards area-based planning, the quicker that the  concerns about a postcode lottery can be put to bed.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  The Minister of confusion and mess has said that substantial structural change  will be needed and that she will &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>: She has said that she will require the <span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">co-operation of the controlled sector, the maintained sector</span>, the  voluntary sector and the integrated sector in order to change the nature and  number of their schools and the method of  their admissions. How does she intend to ensure in her vision the co-operation of all those sectors?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Does she intend to enforce structural change on those sectors? Amidst what she said earlier, the  Minister did not actually answer Mr Lunn&rsquo;s question on her threat to  remove funding. Which aspect of funding will she not give to those schools who  do not comply with her new system?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: As  I said earlier, area-based planning will be the way forward. Part of area-based  planning, as the Member will know, is about working with all education  stakeholders. I am also chairing a high-level group of chairpersons, from all  education sectors, to consider how we can move forward with all aspects of  education reform.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have answered the question on funding. The Department is  under no obligation &mdash; let me give my exact words so that I am not accused  wrongly. I said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;If any school, however, chooses to operate  independent admissions arrangements that lie outside the new system of  transfer, I want to make it clear that there is no obligation on my Department  to assist with funding.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>: I  heard that.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  know that you did. However, I am saying it again because you obviously did not  listen to what I said.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I am not going to welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement this morning. However, I  will note it. I note that her message is contrary to that of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister, who are currently in America where they are praising our  education system and trying to sell it to the Americans as a basis for  investment. That is a bit of a mixed message, Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s statement  is high on clich&eacute;s, platitudes and phrases, and all that that is leading  to, and it has been referred to again and again by other Members, is confusion  for parents, teachers and children. That is not fair to any of them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The way in which the Minister has brought her statement to  the House is reminiscent, for those of us who have served in local councils, of  those edgy &mdash; and Mr Speaker, I am coming to my question and I will save you  from the effort of getting to your feet &mdash; planning applications that are  presented just before Christmas, Easter or the Twelfth of July. Members in the  House will know exactly what I mean.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister tell  us whether she really consulted with her colleagues in the Executive? In  particular, did she consult with the Minister for Social Development and the  Minister for Employment and Learning? Will she also tell me why she feels that  she can bring these proposals to the House when she cannot get cross-community  support in her Committee and is also unlikely to get the required support in  the House by bringing the matter forward in the manner in which she has done?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  welcome the Member&rsquo;s comments on the economy: it is essential that our  education system is built for the dynamic economy that will be created by the  Executive. I welcome the fact that the First Minister  and deputy First Minister are in North America,  where they are promoting the North. That is very important.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will know that I met with the Institute of Directors (IOD), the CBI and other organisations  that under&shy;stand the importance of the economy and the role that the  education system plays in it. I know that they will be pleased by the proposals  that I have brought to the House today. We  are sending out a new message that says that we have a vision of a  world-class education system, a vision in which equality for all our children  is the cornerstone, and a vision in which life skills and job skills are  matched to the needs of the economy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a good time for the North; it is a good time for this  island, and it is a good time for relations between this island and England, Scotland  and Wales.  We can be part of bringing about change in the North for all our children and  not just for some.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I hope that many Members in the Chamber agree that we have to do something  about the present education system, which labels and stigmatises so many of our  young children as failures. Having looked  at the flowery language of the Minister&rsquo;s state&shy;ment, there are some worrying matters. I am certain that in  September 2010, there will be confusion and chaos.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister not recognise that, even with the  criteria that were outlined today, there will be a free-for-all that will suit  the grammar schools but do serious damage to secondary schools? That will sound  the death knell for many secondary schools. It is very worrying that, in her  statement, the Minister makes much of her contact and discussions with the  grammar schools. Will she give an assurance that she will take steps to protect small schools and the rural  communities that support them, and that children in rural areas will not  have to travel excessive distances to urban centres?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  do not accept that there will be a free-for-all. This will be carefully managed  change. I would not use the term &ldquo;flowery&rdquo;; I would use the term &ldquo;visionary&rdquo;. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are creating an education system that places the child  at the centre. Unfortunately, to date, the children have not been placed at the  centre of the system. We will now be doing that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I share the Member&rsquo;s view on secondary schools. They have  borne the brunt of demographic decline. I have been out and about in secondary  schools right across the North, in all different communities, and they are  crying out for change. I ask the Members across the Chamber to listen to them;  they need to listen. At the moment, we have chaos and the secondary schools are  bearing the brunt of demographic decline. It is not fair. We need change.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to small schools and rural schools, there will,  for the first time, be area-based planning. The people involved in the local  education sectors are best placed to put that provision in place. In fact, in  many cases, the work has already started, and those people are leading the way.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Order. I ask the Member to take his seat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. As a secondary-school  teacher for 35 years, I saw all that was wrong with the 11-plus selection  system. I want to ask the Minister, with regard to &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. A number of meetings are taking place around the Chamber.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  There seems to be a feeling that the 11-plus decided how many excellent  youngsters &mdash; youngsters well capable of academic education &mdash; there were. In  fact, the number of people who passed the 11-plus depended much more on the  number of grammar-school places that were available &mdash; as the Minister has said,  about 30% of the total school capacity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The 11-plus started life as a way of providing &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Where is the question?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Can the Member get to his question?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>: I  am going to ask a question now. I am just trying to think of one. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="Italic"><strong><span style="font-style:normal; ">Mr  S Wilson:</span></strong></span><span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; "> He has worked himself up to it.</span></span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  The 11-plus started life as a means of giving scholar&shy;ships to poor youngsters  so that they could get into secondary education. However, when secondary  education became compulsory and free, everybody was able to get it, and the  11-plus, unfortunately, was used &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Question.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>: I  am going to ask a question.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I ask the Member to come to his question.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Some Members took much longer to ask their questions than I am taking. Anyhow,  my question is &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  He has forgotten it now.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the day of the grammar school is now gone, given  that grammar schools now go out to the  highways and byways to gather up anyone whom they can so that they can receive further funding?</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat as an cheist sin. I believe firmly that we must have academic  excellence in our education system. I look forward to working with all schools,  including grammar schools, to ensure that the future arrangements &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Answer the question.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  am answering the question. I wish to ensure that the future arrangements that I  will introduce will guarantee academic excellence in the education system.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  will try to bring a bit of calm to the Chamber. I am glad that the former Sinn  F&eacute;in MLA recognised the reality of the situation over the weekend: namely that  &mdash; just as an Irish language Act needed DUP support &mdash; to get rid of academic  selection, which is safeguarded in the legislation that came about as a result  of the St Andrews Agreement, Sinn F&eacute;in needs my party&rsquo;s support, and that of  this side of the House. That is not going to happen, and the Minister knew that  it was not going to happen. Therefore, it was her responsibility to put  proposals that could secure the support of everyone in the House. She has  failed to do that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In her statement, the Minister said that she had spoken to  teachers, parents, pupils and administrators, and that she plans a further  process of consultation. I do not know in which language she conversed with  those people, because in successive polls and surveys, and among people to whom I have spoken, the message is clear:  there is public support for the principle of academic selection. Parents  support it, as do teachers. My question is a simple one that requires only a  yes or no answer. Does the Minister believe  that her proposals will secure the  support of the people of Northern    Ireland, the Executive and the House?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  do.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Will the Minister&rsquo;s proposals narrow the gap between respect for vocational  qualifications and academic qualifications? It is important, as we go forward,  that greater respect is accorded to vocational qualifications.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  Sin ceist an-mhaith. We must ensure that all children have access to various  pathways, and that equal respect is afforded to whatever pathway is chosen. It  should not be an either/or situation; it can be both. We can provide for choice  between professional, technical or  vocational qualifications, and the academic route. If a young person  wants to be an engineer, is it not better  that he or she can study technology alongside maths and sciences? That  is common sense.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In line with the current curriculum, one third of all  courses in all schools must be either academic or professional and technical.  The Member has raised a fundamental point: if our economy is to thrive, it is essential that vocational qualifications be given  respect.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  It is very clear on this side of the House that we give the Minister&rsquo;s  proposals a grade F for failure, and that her report card would read, &ldquo;must do  much better.&rdquo; She has given no consideration to the current legislation, which enshrines academic selection, nor has  she given any consideration to what happens between 2009 and 2011, nor the need  to achieve cross-party consensus in the  Chamber for her proposals. What consideration has the Minister given to  the inevitable cost of the upheaval that her proposals will cause &mdash; proposals  that are doomed to fail?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  thank the Member for the F grade. The Irish word for vision &mdash; f&iacute;s &mdash; starts with  the letter f, so I will take that as a compliment. I hope that we will achieve  consensus; that is my plan. I hope that we will agree a way forward and create  an education system that values all our children.  I have answered the question on cost. I believe that we can transform  our education estate within the resources that I have, and bring about the  changes that are necessary.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The Minister has not provided much clarity. Has the Department carried out any  work on valuing the schools estate, and has  it assessed the work that needs to be done? Since the Minister is so confident that she can secure cross-community support,  will she give an undertaking to the Assembly that Members will have the  opportunity to vote on her proposals?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: My Department and I have been working on these proposals for  the past six months. Therefore, the answer to the Member&rsquo;s first question is  yes. I forget his second question. Perhaps he will repeat it.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>: Will there be an opportunity for the Assembly to vote on the  proposals? I shall ask another question: where are the Minister&rsquo;s officials  today?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="Italic"><strong><span style="font-style:normal; ">Mr  McNarry:</span></strong></span><span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; "> Yes, where are the Minister&rsquo;s officials?</span></span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Please allow the Minister to answer.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: My  officials, who have been working closely with me for the past six months, are  working today. They are busy, because this is a very exciting day for the  education system in the North. I am grand here on my own. I know what my vision  is.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In answer to the second part of Mr McCallister&rsquo;s question,  I will make a further statement in the new year on the progress being made towards agreement for transfer in 2010.  I will prepare draft regulations to underpin the securing of agreement. I will  then bring the proposals to the Executive and to the Committee for Education  for consideration and comment before engagement. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Does the Minister believe that the focus on transfer at the age of 14 brushes  under the carpet some of the problems about transfer at the age of 11? There will still be problems with  oversubscription and possibly selection by postcode. What steps are being taken to avoid selection by postcode and the  related pressures on the housing market? Although Francie Brolly has  declared that grammar schools are gone, I want to ask whether secondary schools  will be able to obtain funding to make them  equal to grammar schools.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: Rather  than creating a postcode lottery, I intend to abolish a life lottery. As I said  earlier, under the old regime, that life lottery gambled with the lives of  children and the futures of families, based on children of 11 years of age  completing two tests lasting one hour each. Under my new vision, the watchword  will be &ldquo;equality&rdquo;. Many families do not have the wherewithal or the personal  desire for additional tuition or academic coaching for their primary-school  children. Those considerations will no longer be necessary. We have here the  outline of a vision that is based on local and area-based planning. The  resources for the schools in that system will be allocated in a fair and equal  way.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>: Having listened to what the Minister has said and read some of  the stuff in her statement, I have to say  that it is no wonder that the entire education system is totally  confused. She says that she wrote to her colleagues. In fact, she wrote to one  colleague and delivered the letter today at 10.50 am. That is the consultation  in which the Minister believes. However, that tells Members something: the  Minister knows perfectly well that there is no hope of her proposals going  through. Those proposals have come from a narrow, sectarian, political  viewpoint &mdash; the Minister&rsquo;s sectarianism drips from her. We have news for her:  not only will she not get her proposals through the Assembly, but she has no  chance of getting them through the Executive. That is why she refuses to  consult her Executive colleagues. If the Minister thinks that this stuff &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to come to the question.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  If the Minister thinks that this stuff is going to anywhere in the Assembly, we  can tell her today that it is going  absolutely nowhere. She had better learn that and learn it quickly. She  has introduced proposals and manifestly made an attempt to close all  post-primary rural schools in County   Fermanagh. She talks  about equality, but, in fact, she is going to round up people in Fermanagh &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member please come to the question.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I am coming to the question now.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">She intends to round up people in rural areas and send them  all into Enniskillen town. Will the Minister tell the House where the rural  equality is in her proposals? She should hang her head in shame.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: This is a proud day for me. I am delighted with the outline of  the vision that I have presented. It will give every child a fair chance in an  education system that matches children to suitable provision. The proposals that  the Member mentions in relation to Fermanagh have been brought forward by the  boards.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  And?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  And it is very important that all political representatives read them carefully  and engage with the process. I do not know where the Member lives, or what  world he is living in. Maybe he should visit some of the secondary schools in  the unionist community, talk to the principals, and hear directly from them how  they are being affected under the current system. I have had meetings with  principals from all kinds of schools &mdash; all the different sectors, all the  different creeds and all the different politics. They tell me that we need  change. We need an education system that is fit for the twenty-first century.  We need a system that puts the children at the centre, and that is what I am  going to do.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Maybe the Member is willing to live in the past and condemn  4,000 young people to poor literacy and numeracy skills, but I am not. I am the  Minister of Education for every child in the North of Ireland, and I am going to ensure that every child has  opportunities.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to ending the 11-plus, but I am extremely  disappointed, as many of those disadvantaged by the current system will be, by  her proposal to sustain a range of different types of school. In effect, that  is selection, slotting children into schools. It brands the schools as failures  or successes. This vision is a new system of social selection, which represents  a missed opportunity for the Minister. She has abandoned Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s former  policy and she has abandoned the most disadvantaged children in society. It is  a missed opportunity to create one system &mdash; not a two-tier or two-gear system,  but one of equality in schools and education that values each child equally.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that a &lsquo;ChuckleVision&rsquo; view of  education does not create a tiger economy? East or west, tiger economies are  not based on academically selective systems. Will the Minister outline &mdash; and  other Members have talked about it this morning &mdash; what discussions she has had  with her Executive colleagues and with other parties in the Assembly on these  proposals, and how she proposes to secure the broadest community support for  them?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  First of all, every area is different, as Members will know. One size does not  fit all. We are going to look at a range of  provision, and I do not accept that it is a postcode lottery. We are  going to look at access to an 11-19 school, transfer to an alternative 11-19  school, access through an 11-19 or post-14 school, and transfer to a 14-19  school. The Member needs to understand that everywhere is different. Rural  areas are different from urban areas. I will be seeking the views of all the  different stakeholders in relation to the provision that we will be having. It  is important that we do not go down the road of one size fits all. No child  will be disadvantaged, and all children will have access to a wide range of  subjects and pathways.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome today&rsquo;s statement and the  debate that it has begun. It is simply a statement of fact and reality that there is no consensus for the current  education arrangements, particularly the transfer system. Therefore,  change is required and inevitable. Does the Minister agree that the challenge  for Members of this Assembly is to give leadership on this issue, to embrace  change and to reject the failed status quo, not to behave as the dysfunctional  product of a failed education system? Is she listening carefully to the Shankill Road  principals&rsquo; consortium and its rejection of academic selection and transfer  tests?</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  absolutely agree that we must show political leadership to match that of the  principals and teachers in our schools, who are crying out for it. They  understand the impact on secondary schools of 50,000 empty desks, of changing  the review of public admin&shy;istration, of creating the education and skills  authority (ESA), and of demographic decline. I am confident that we can bring  forward proposals that will have the  support of the vast majority of secondary and grammar schools. I ask all  the political leaders here to show the necessary leadership; we can either hide  our heads in the sand and pretend that there is no problem or we can lead by  example. With that in mind, I welcome the question.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have been in many different communities, one of which was  the Shankill. I have met the principals&rsquo; forums and the north Belfast controlled sector forum. I have been  to Millburn in Coleraine, and to Ballymena, Derry,  the Falls Road &mdash; all over the North &mdash; and, by and large, the current system is  failing working-class pupils. There must be change, and I ask you to work with  me, rather than fight that change every step of the way. I will fight if I must,  but I would like to work with Members to create the system that is needed.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  would have been happy to join in welcoming the Minister&rsquo;s vision for education.  However, this morning, the problem is that we have a right to expect something  more than a vision that could have been expounded a few months ago. There is a huge amount lacking in her statement. For  example, can she explain how she  will make area-based planning meaningful when, in many areas &mdash; such as  Antrim, in my constituency &mdash; the education and library board on one hand and CCMS on the other have already gone through  a rationalisation process? The problem of empty desks remains.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In a rare moment of unity with Miss McIlveen &mdash; and my  colleague Trevor Lunn &mdash; I repeat a point that the Minister made and ask what  the implications are:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;If any school, however, chooses to operate  independent admissions arrangements that lie outside the new system of transfer  &hellip; there is no obligation on my Department to assist with funding.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Does that relate solely to the funding of the new  transfer arrangements, or is there an implied threat to those schools in  general?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I have already answered the last question, so I will not do so  again.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Area-based planning is fundamental. It must be &mdash; and will  be &mdash; put in place with the support of all the education partners.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  Listening to Radio Ulster  on the way to Stormont this morning, I was looking forward to an important  statement on education. Something along the lines of Dickson academic selection  at 14 was being flagged up, and I thought  that that meant some progress, with an announcement that could receive  cross-community and popular support for our future education system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What disappoints me about the Minister&rsquo;s statement is its  total lack of content and clarity. I therefore ask for a precise answer to a  precise question. Referring to the future, she mentioned &mdash; after the Irish bit  &mdash; the introduction of regulations, following a consultation process.  Regulations are clearly understood to be under her executive authority as a Minister. Are we, therefore, about  to see the destruction of our grammar schools and academic selection by Martin  McGuinness mark II, or will that be blocked  by the authority of this House? Can she be clear: is it to be  regulations or legislation?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I,  too, listened to Radio Ulster  today. The principal of Portadown   College spoke, and her  vision was interesting. She said clearly that the area in which the Dickson  method operates has been much more effective than other areas in the North. I  differ from the current system in that I do not believe that academic selection is necessary at 14; it is unjust and  unnecessary.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We can create a system of academic excellence by matching children to suitable provision. I have  answered the Member&rsquo;s question already, so I do not know how much  clearer that I can be. I will bring my proposals to the Executive, and I will  work with my colleagues in the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement. Speaking as someone who was a teacher for  more than 30 years, predominantly in Northern Ireland grammar schools, I fully endorse the principles behind the  changes, which reflect the need to provide an appropriate educational  pathway for every child, and an equal opportunity  for every child to realise his or her potential.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If places in heavily subscribed schools are allocated on  the basis of residential location &mdash; the proximity of a child&rsquo;s home to a school  &mdash; does the Minister accept that that will lead to property hot spots and,  ultimately, to a system in which money talks? Surely a system that allocates  school places according to how much money a child&rsquo;s parents have is even more  unjust than one that allocates according to academic ability. Will the Minister  guarantee to the House that she will avoid, at all costs, a system that  reserves places at the most desirable schools for those who are better off?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  First, I say go raibh maith agat to the Member for his initial comments. There  will always be pressure on popular schools in our education system. However, we  now have an opportunity, because of excess places in our school system, to be  more responsive in future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the focus on admissions will shift. The post-14  provision in local areas will be flexible and agile in order to enable all  children to be matched to suitable provision through the organisational  capacity of larger or collaborating institutions. The key point to make is that  no doors will be closed to children.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I hope that I have more success than other Members have had in getting an  answer from the Minister, after the  party-political spoof that I have heard from her today. On what does she  base her suggestion that her announcement  will have the support of children, teachers  and parents? It is certainly not what the opinion polls have indicated  up to now.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: As I have said, I have been out and about, and I have met with  many groups and sectors. An increasing number of people understands that we  need change in our system; an increasing number of people understands that we  need to create an education system that is fit for the twenty-first century;  and an increasing number of people understands that choices for children should  not be based on the outcome of two one-hour tests. Opinions on academic  selection are shifting. I ask that Members go out and talk to their  communities. I have been out talking to them, and opinions are shifting.  Members should talk to the IOD, the CBI, all the teachers&rsquo; unions, and the  various boards and education sectors &mdash; they might hear something that they  would not expect to hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  As someone who belongs to a party that has been totally opposed to the 11-plus,  one would have loved to have come to the Chamber today to say congratulations  to the Minister. She has said that this should be an exciting day, because she  is presenting her vision for the future of our education system. However, it is  a sad day, because the Minister has created only more confusion and a further  lack of clarity on the future of our education system. The Minister has talked about there being a range of  schools and a range of options. Surely that is antipathetic to the ideal  of equality for people in education.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  &ldquo;Equality&rdquo; and &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; are closely linked words. I am disappointed that the  Member does not understand the range of provision. My proposals offer local  solutions, because different areas have different needs. I urge Members not to  stay in their constituencies but to go out into other constituencies to see the  differences that operate at different levels. Equality does not mean that  everything need be the same. Equality is a celebration of diversity but with a  fair system put in place.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  The Minister&rsquo;s proposals are far-reaching. Can those changes be made within the  existing education budget, or will the Minister require more finances to  complete the task that lies ahead?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  Many of the changes are far-reaching, and I will use the existing resources to  bring about maximum change in the system.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  No more Members wish to ask questions. That brings to an end questions on the  ministerial statement. The Business Committee has arranged to meet immediately  upon the lunchtime suspension.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Standing Order 60(1)(e) relates to the use of  unparlia&shy;mentary language. When Paul Butler rose to his feet to ask a question,  the word &ldquo;lapdog&rdquo; was called out in the Chamber. Will you rule, Mr Speaker, on  whether that is parliamentary language, and if it is not, will you ask the  Member responsible to withdraw the comment?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I continually say to all sides of the House that there are debates that can  give rise to some tension in the House. I have always said that Members must be  mindful of the language that they use. I will study the Hansard report and  return to the House on the matter.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I was trying to say before I was interrupted on a point  of order, the Business Committee has agreed to meet immediately upon the  lunchtime suspension. I propose, therefore, by leave of the Assembly, to  suspend the sitting until 2.00 pm.</p>

		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: No, not if the Member has an objection, in which case I will  suspend the sitting until there is a quorum.</p>

Therefore, the 2005 international  health regulations, which the World Health Organization issued, seek to  strengthen the defences against a wider range of threats, such as chemical and  radiological contamination.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is necessary to enable ports in Northern Ireland to implement the new inspection and  certification regime. The Bill simply amends the regulation-making powers in section 2A of the Public Health Act (Northern<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> Ireland</span>) 1967. That section deals with the control of certain diseases. The Bill  has two clauses. By adding new paragraph (c) to section 2A(1) of the 1967 Act,  clause 1 will extend my Department&rsquo;s power to make regulations to prevent:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the spread of infection or contamination by means of  any vessel or aircraft leaving any place,  so far as may be necessary or expedient for the purpose of carrying out  any treaty, convention, arrangement or engagement with any other country&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">Clause 2 sets out the Bill&rsquo;s short  title.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In order to be able to comply with the international health regulations, the Public Health (Ships)  Regulations (Northern Ireland)  1971 and Public Health (Aircraft) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1971 must be  amended. The international health regulations were remade in 2005 and agreed  with the United Kingdom.  Northern Ireland  is therefore obliged to provide a legislative framework to implement our international  obligations under those regulations. This  will allow new ship sanitation control certificates to replace deratting  certificates, which will have no  international validity after this month.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The new certificates deal with infection and with rodents that  can carry human disease, and, for the first time, chemical and radiological  contamination will be addressed. The Bill is necessary so that the Port of Belfast,  for example, can have the same certification power as Liverpool and can impose  the same sanitation standards as Shanghai or Liberia. We  must put in place new regulations for Northern Ireland in the form of subordinate legislation, which requires parent  legislation. Having examined the 1967 Act, I concluded that its powers are inadequate for that purpose. Amended  ships and aircraft regulations will,  therefore, have to be made under the 1967 Act&rsquo;s new powers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must act quickly by passing the Bill, in order to enable our ports to once again carry out those  functions that are required under  the World Health Organization&rsquo;s regulations.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  As the Minister stated, the Public Health (Amendment) Bill is very short. It  consists of one main clause and a further clause that sets out the short title.  The Minister advised the Health Committee that he intended to introduce the  Bill, and I am grateful to the officials who  came to the Committee on 15 November to explain its background and  purpose. The officials explained, as has the Minister today, that it is a  technical Bill, and that it is necessary to allow the Department to respond to  new international requirements. It is designed to enable the Department to  comply with international health regulations introduced by the World Health  Organization. The Bill will give the Department power to make regulations that  are aimed at improving and modernising the way in which public health checks  are carried out on ships and ports.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The explanatory and financial memorandum states that the  introduction of the Bill was the only option available to allow the Department  to comply with international health regulations. This type of single clause  legislation must surely be a costly way in which to proceed, from the perspective of both the Department and the  Assembly, and given the time and resources that must be devoted to it. It is a  process that should be used only in exceptional circumstances.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What options, other  than legislation, were considered to allow the Department to meet its  obligations in that regard? If legislation is the only option, when did it  first become apparent that a change in legislation was required? It appears  from the explanatory and financial memorandum that the Department has been  aware of the issue for at least a year, as it states:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;stakeholder engagement has been taking place since  the beginning of 2007.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If that is the case, what consideration was given  to including such provision in any other Bill?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill, if agreed, will come before the Committee for  detailed consideration. I note from the explanatory and financial memorandum  that the consultation with stakeholders produced no concerns or comments. I am sure that the Committee will wish to examine the  nature and extent of that consultation. I trust that the Minister will  make all the paperwork relating to the consultation available to the Committee.  Subject to a satisfactory explanation from the Minister, I am content to  support the general provision of the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  As a member of the Health Committee, I welcome the Bill. The Minister drew  attention to the Port   of Belfast, and, as a  member of the Committee for Regional  Development, I am well aware of the necessity for our ports to meet  international standards. Therefore, I have no problem in welcoming the Bill and  supporting the measures contained therein.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I will deal with  some of the points made by the Chairperson of the Health Committee. As far as  legal advice is concerned, it was not possible to simply amend the existing  ship and aircraft regulations, as they were made under powers contained in  section 143 of the Public Health Act 1936. Although the Act did not extend to Northern Ireland, section 143(9) entitles the  provisions of that section to be extended to Northern Ireland only in so far as  they relate to regulations with respect to matters on which the Parliament of  Northern Ireland has no power to make laws. Therefore, the steps that we take  are correct, according to legal advice.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The World Health Organization&rsquo;s regulations were passed in  2005. The process began at that time, and it has been under discussion and  consultation since the beginning of this year. The formal consultation on  marine and public health interests in Northern Ireland has elicited no comment or concerns. The only  concerns expressed to my Department relate to the failure of Northern Ireland to come into line with England and  meet our international obligations, which we now do.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><em>Question put and agreed to.</em></p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion"><strong><em>Resolved</em></strong><em>: </em>That the Second Stage of the Public Health (Amendment) Bill (NIA 8/07) be  agreed.</p>

		    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: The Business Committee has agreed to  allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for the debate.  The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other  Members who speak will have five minutes.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly, in view of the increase in &lsquo;spiking&rsquo; of  drinks, calls on the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to  provide for date rape prevention kits to be made available free of charge.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The motion  calls on the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to provide  date rape prevention kits free of charge, and I hope that it gets the full  support of the Assembly. One purpose behind the motion is to raise public awareness that drink-spiking has  happened; is happening, and can happen to anyone.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is timely that the motion is being debated today as  Christmas is three weeks&rsquo; away. Christmas is the time of year when we, as a society, go out more, attend more parties and &mdash; unfortunately &mdash; drink more. Sadly  some people see that as an opportunity to ruin lives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Last year, the Rape Crisis and Sexual Abuse Centre received  a number of reports from women who feared that  their drinks had been spiked. Dozens of similar cases have been reported throughout the year.  Overindulgence in alcohol does play a big part in the problem, and in  some cases people have not had their drink spiked but have just drunk too much.  However, in other cases drinks have been spiked; figures from the Rape Crisis  and Sexual Abuse Centre indicated that there were 40 reported incidents of  drug-related rape and sexual abuse in the North in 2006, which is an increase  on previous years.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Advisory Council on  the Misuse of Drugs clearly states that drug-facilitated sexual assaults  &mdash; including the use of alcohol &mdash; are a significant problem. I congratulate the  Health Promotion Agency and drug and alcohol support groups for accepting that  there is a problem with people having their drinks spiked, and for developing  an advertising campaign that includes putting up posters in pubs and clubs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Education is a key factor in ensuring that people can protect themselves &mdash; every effort must be made to  alert people to the issue. As I said, the Advisory Council on the Misuse  of Drugs highlights a number of issues and offers good advice.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The advisory council states that advice that will minimise  the risk of drug-facilitated sexual assaults should be targeted at secondary  schools, as well as further and higher educational establishments. <strong>Further&shy;more, that advice should, as  appropriate, include the following message</strong>: plan journeys to and from home;  avoid going alone to a club, pub or party; make sure that someone knows where  you are going and what time you will be back; stay aware of what is happening  around you, and avoid situations in which you feel uncomfortable; do not accept  a drink from anyone that you do not trust; do not share or exchange drinks; and  do not leave your drink unattended &mdash; even when going to the toilet, take it  with you.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That final piece of  advice has been made more difficult by the introduction of the smoking  ban, because most pubs and clubs do not allow their customers to take their  drinks outside. Everyone should follow that advice from the advisory council,  and doing so will minimise the risk of drink-spiking.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although some organisations &mdash; including the advisory council  &mdash; have said that the public should be made aware that the so-called drug  detectors cannot be relied on, they will help in making people aware of the  issue. The advisory council also states that further research should be  promoted. The motion calls on the Minister to provide date-rape prevention kits  free of charge, but that does not mean that finance should come solely from the  Health Department&rsquo;s budget. Pubs, clubs and the vintners&rsquo; associations have a  part to play, because public houses are where most drink-spiking takes place.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Door staff also have a part to play in ensuring that people  are safe. They must accept that drink-spiking takes place, and they need to be  trained to deal with the issue. Door staff should not assume that someone is  drunk; they have a duty to ensure that people are safe and feel safe in their  premises. They must also ensure that people feel safe when they leave  establishments and are not in a vulnerable state, as is so often the case. I  urge the Minister to organise a meeting with the relevant bodies as early as  possible to ensure that drink-spiking prevention kits are provided free of  charge. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  I support the motion. I do not drink or frequent pubs and clubs; nonetheless, I  am concerned about the increase in assaults and rapes on women. This is an area  in which we should exercise zero tolerance. Drink-spiking receives a lot of  media attention, and anecdotal evidence suggests that it is very much on the  rise. It is <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">not possible to know whether the  stories are always true</span>, but it is true to say that many young people  are fearful about falling victim to having their drinks spiked.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some figures suggest that Northern   Ireland has a problem, and for a region of the United Kingdom  that <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">has a population of only 1&middot;7 million,  we have an incidence</span> equal to or higher than other regions that have a  much higher population. Therefore we cannot dismiss the problem as the result  of exaggerated stories or pretend that  drink-spiking does not happen to people in Northern<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> </span><span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">Ireland</span>. Although we must remain aware of the dangers  of drink-spiking, we must also remember  that, whatever the incidence of drink-spiking, alcohol is a drug that  remains the main contributor to date rape. Whatever steps are taken to ensure  that nothing is added to a drink, the effects of the alcohol &mdash; when consumed in  the quantities often associated with today&rsquo;s binge-drinking culture &mdash; can leave someone open to the same types of assault as any of the so-called  date-rape drugs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The drinks that are popular among young people &mdash;  particularly young women &mdash; can allow for drink-spiking. Strong flavours and  bright colours can mask any tastes or colours that could be telltale signs that a drink has been spiked. It is much better  to attempt to prevent drink-spiking from occurring, and many women take  many of the simple steps that can prevent their drinks being tampered with. By  ensuring that they do not leave a drink  unattended, they are taking a simple step to reduce the chances of  anything happening to their drink. However, it is difficult to ensure that  there is no opportunity during a night out for someone to tamper with the drink  at some stage of the evening.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Improvements are being made. Public awareness is strong,  and some good initiatives are being introduced by pub and club operators.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms S Ramsey: I thank the Chairperson of the <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">Committee for Health, Social Services and Public  Safety</span> for her support for the motion. Raising awareness is a key issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my opening remarks, I forgot to mention men, who are  also being targeted and are having their drinks spiked for other reasons. I did  not mean to give the impression that it is only women who are victims, because  young men&rsquo;s drinks are also being spiked.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs I Robinson: I thank the Member for her comments,  with which I agree. I am talking about women specifically, and I have been in  contact with the Rape Crisis and Sexual Abuse Centre. However, that does not  preclude the fact that men&rsquo;s drinks are also being spiked.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the main times that a drink is left unattended is  when someone is in the toilets, so some premises have installed small lockers  where drinks can be deposited and locked away. The measures that I have  mentioned so far can be taken either by an individual or by the drinks  industry, which can help to put extra safeguards in place.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls on the Minister to make date-rape  prevention kits available free of charge, and although the provision of  anything that helps to prevent such terrible abuse of an individual will be  welcomed, we must ensure that any prevention campaign does not lead to  complacency and people ignoring the fact that alcohol itself can be as powerful  a drug as the one that may be placed in their drink.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Small plastic stoppers that can be fitted onto the top of  bottles are a relatively cheap, but effective, way to prevent substances being  added to drinks. Whether the Department provides the stoppers or simply works  with the drinks industry to encourage their provision, that measure is only one  part of an overall strategy to reduce the incidence of drink-spiking.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Kits that are supposed to detect whether a drink has been  tampered with may play a role, but there are questions about their reliability.  Therefore, prevention of spiking in the first place is the ultimate goal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that today&rsquo;s debate will ensure that people will  take extra care over the Christmas season so that we can prevent even one  person&rsquo;s drink being spiked.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to consider seriously the role that the  Department can play and how the availability of some relatively inexpensive  measures could help to reduce the problem even further.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong><span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">Mr McCallister</span></strong>: I thank the Members who tabled this important motion, if only  to give the House an opport&shy;unity to debate some of the issues that surround  it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Roofie Foundation is the only specialist agency in the UK that deals  with the issue of drug rape. The Northern Ireland branch runs in  conjunction with the Rape Crisis and Sexual Abuse Centre. The foundation was  established by Graham Rhodes after he had conducted research in spring 1996  into the subject of drug-related rape and sexual abuse. Statistics issued by  the foundation show that 68% of date-rape drugs were administered in pubs, clubs, wine bars or bistros, which is 6,285 out of a total of 9,260 incidents. Those  statistics point overwhelmingly to the need for a solution that involves  premises being regulated.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are not dealing only with sexual offences. The Roofie  Foundation believes that there may be up to 2,000 cases of drug-assisted  robbery, compared with 900 incidents of drug-assisted rape, to which some  Members have already referred.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The prevention measures fall short of legislation, but they  could be combined with minimal legislation. Although the police and voluntary  groups have issued a number of guidelines on drink protection that include  urging people to watch their drinks, refusing to allow strangers to buy them  drinks and not leaving drinks unattended, there are devices on the market that  seek to prevent drink-spiking. They come in two main varieties: those that  prevent a drink being spiked in the first place; and those that prevent a  spiked drink being drunk.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those include the Drink Detective, a matchbox-size test kit  for drinks, which indicates clearly whether a drink  has been spiked. The kit can be used by paramedics and club and bar  owners to test any suspicious drinks. SafeFlow,  which has been tested by police forces across the UK, is another  system that relies on prevention rather than detection. A packet of six  SafeFlow bottle tops costs around &pound;2. A cap is placed on the top of a bottle,  which cannot be removed easily, and the drink can  be accessed only through a straw. Spikey is another device that  emphasises protection.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must stress also the  responsibility of the bar owner. A  duty of reasonable care must be placed on bar owners, who, after all, profit from the sale of drink.  They should be expected to provide a safe environment for their  customers. Pub and club owners are responsible for enforcing licensing laws, so  they should be responsible for administering safety laws in respect of pub and  club users.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In response to a question tabled in the House of Commons,  the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary <strong>of  State at the Home Office, Caroline Flint, stated</strong>:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;While bottle caps and drink holders may reduce the  potential for drink-spiking, they too can provide a false reassurance of  safely, given evidence that it is the consumption of alcohol, rather than  drink-spiking, which more commonly increases vulnerability to sexual crime&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That brings me back to  the problem of binge drinking, which Mrs Robinson has already mentioned.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on the measures that  his Department is taking with regard to binge drinking.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Binge drinking leaves young women vulnerable to sexual  predators and young men vulnerable to other forms of crime. The problem is not  just about drink-spiking, but about how much alcohol a person drinks. Positive  steps must be taken against bar and club owners  who boost drink sales through special promotions, in which highly  alcoholic shots are sold at a heavy discount. We must have dialogue with the  drinks and entertainment industry. I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s  comments.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  support the motion, and I thank Sinn F&eacute;in Members for bringing the matter to  the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This issue must be addressed by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS)  and others. However, the whole drink culture is an associated issue, and  it must be addressed urgently. Excessive drinking and binge drinking &mdash; abusing  alcohol and consuming it irresponsibly &mdash; are ongoing problems in Northern Ireland,  and the negative effect that that has on  physical and mental health cannot be underestimated. The dangers of  alcohol abuse must be made clear and prioritised by the Department, as too many  lives are being ruined.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In response to a question for written answer to the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety about alcohol, I was  told that more than 8,000 people in Northern   Ireland received hospital treatment for alcohol-related  illnesses last year and that treatment over  the last three years cost Northern    Ireland &pound;35 million. The misuse of  alcohol is a major public-health issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Numerous problems arise when alcohol is abused. People  spike drinks for several reasons; the intention being to sexually assault, rape  or rob the person whose drink has been spiked. Sometimes the only motivation is  to see what effect the drug will have. All types of people have become victims  of drink-spiking, but the majority of  victims appear to be young women. The act of spiking a drink is a  criminal offence and can gravely endanger a person&rsquo;s life. If that person has a  serious reaction to the drug and dies, the person responsible for spiking the  drink could face a murder charge.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">These attacks often go unreported, and, therefore, the  issue may be more serious than we realise.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that staff in bars and clubs &mdash; where the  majority of drink-spiking occurs &mdash; pick up on what is happening, report any  incidents, and are trained to deal with  victims. Likewise, accident and emergency staff must be on hand to deal  with cases, which are most likely to be seen in the early hours of the morning  when A&amp;E departments are crammed with patients.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As with binge drinking or drink-driving, approaches to dealing with drink-spiking come back to the  need for better education and  putting out clear messages to people who  drink irresponsibly. I am aware that campaigns are running, and they  must continue. However, to reduce the prevalence of drink-spiking, even if we  do get the date-rape prevention kits, messages such as &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave your drink  unattended&rdquo;, &ldquo;Never let someone that you don&rsquo;t know buy you a drink&rdquo; and &ldquo;When  you buy a drink, watch the barperson pouring it&rdquo; must continue to be hammered  home.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Even if one does these  things to prevent drink-spiking, there  is still a risk, and I understand the reasoning behind date-rape  prevention kits. However, if such kits are recommended by the police or the  Department, it is important that they be  foolproof and give accurate results.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am worried by a recent University of Ulster  report suggesting that excessive drinking is a factor in the rise of sexual attacks and rapes. Although I do not  blame the victims for such attacks,  it is fair to say that responsible drinking could improve women&rsquo;s  well-being and safety, especially that of younger women, who may be particularly vulnerable. Sex attackers often take  advantage of situations and perpetrate opportunistic assaults as a  result of victims&rsquo; voluntarily drinking themselves into helplessness.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The risks associated with the rise of binge drinking are  plentiful, and drink-spiking is another example of the dangers. The Minister of  Health has told the Health Committee that he will prioritise health education,  and the University  of Ulster report suggests that the  Depart&shy;ment must sustain that  prioritisation if we are to high&shy;light the risks of binge drinking and  drink-spiking and reduce their frequency in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank Sue Ramsey and Jennifer McCann for bringing such an important issue to  the House, particularly in light of the fact that the festive season is  approaching.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a Pioneer, a teetotaller, and a person who knows little  about what goes on in drinking environments, I have no problem supporting the  motion if it contributes to increased safety for those who wish to socialise  and consume drink in a public place. However, the motion does not consider the  cost to the taxpayer of providing free date-rape prevention kits. Perhaps that  issue might be addressed in the winding-up speech.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms S Ramsey: I did not for one minute suggest that money should come from the Department&rsquo;s budget,  which I know is under pressure.  Pubs, clubs and vintners have a responsibility and must play their part,  because, as John McCallister said, they make big profits. I ask the Minister to  ensure that the costs impact collectively on those groups that have a duty and  responsibility to deal with the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McCarthy: I thank the Member for that clarific&shy;ation.  Even if such kits were to be supplied free of charge, would they be used? Would  they justify the expenditure, and how could the usage and results be monitored?  Many questions must be answered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is also a problem with the escalation of drug use. If  such kits are provided, and then new or different drugs appear, will the kits be  fit for purpose, or will they be useless and thrown on the scrap heap?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party  believes that &mdash; as other Members have  said &mdash; education is more important. We encourage the use of publicity  campaigns and help from drinking establishments &mdash; as Sue referred to just now &mdash;  in order to get the message home and put the  responsibility on to those people who are at risk.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A big responsibility rests with young people who have  little or no experience of what might go on in certain establishments. More  could be done to make people aware of the dangers that they might encounter on a night out. As other Members have said, the  message must be that people should  never leave a drink unattended, even for a second, and should not accept  drinks from people whom they do not know or trust or, in some cases, even from  those whom they might trust.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Alliance Party&rsquo;s health spokesman, I support any  measures that might prevent people ending up in a GP&rsquo;s surgery, a hospital  accident and emergency unit or worse. If all else fails, and if it can be  proved that the date-rape prevention kits are a cost-effective and appropriate  answer, I will support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: Before I call on the next Member to  speak, I ask all Members to check that their mobile phones are switched off, as  someone&rsquo;s phone is affecting the recording equipment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Buchanan: I apologise on behalf of the Chair&shy;person  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Mrs Robinson,  who has had to leave to go to London.  She would have liked to stay for the rest of the debate but has asked me to  convey her apologies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the sentiments of the motion that is before the House. Drug-related rape and sexual abuse  through&shy;out Northern Ireland  are clear indications of the changing face of the sinful society in  which we live. Stories of unsuspecting victims having their drinks spiked for  nefarious purposes have become a sickening trend, which is on the increase, and  such crimes must be tackled to protect the vulnerable in society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members have mentioned, it is important to point  out that the problem affects men as well as women. However, it must be said  that, irrespective of any measures that may be taken, there will always be  predators who will target and prey upon unsuspecting victims in order to  satisfy their lusts and desires. Therefore, the message of safer and more  responsible drinking, alongside increased awareness and vigilance from friends  and bar staff, will be most effective in increasing  the safety of people who might be vulnerable to drink-spiking. That is  why education is a key factor in alerting people &mdash; young and old &mdash; to the  dangers of drink-spiking.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Bouncers and bar staff have a responsibility to be  vigilant, and they should be trained to recognise the difference between the  tell-tale signs of someone who has been drinking and someone who has been  drugged. Nevertheless, it must be recognised that some respons&shy;ibility lies  with those who consume alcohol and leave themselves in very vulnerable  situations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A survey conducted by the University of Ulster on 8 May  2007 revealed that young women in Northern Ireland are making themselves  vulnerable to rape or serious sexual assault through their binge-drinking  habits. The survey&rsquo;s findings demonstrated that the average alcohol levels at  the time of alleged assaults were almost three times higher than the  drink-driving limit. That is real cause for concern among Members, especially  for members of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the motion calls on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to make date-rape prevention kits available free of  charge, the Minister must focus on a much wider issue. Drink-spiking is not a  matter just for the Minister and the Department. The various statutory bodies  and stakeholders should take a co-ordinated  approach. There should be joined-up action from the vintners, local  district councils, community safety partnerships, district policing  partnerships, the PSNI and other bodies in order to provide the kits at little  or no expense to the Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCarthy asked whether the kits would be fit for  purpose; if they were not, the Minister and other bodies would not be  introducing them. I wish to alleviate the Member&rsquo;s concerns; we will not bring  forward measures that are not fit for purpose, because that would be a waste of  money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, although the Minister should take the lead role, it is important that the other bodies  be brought into the equation to help to eradicate the problem and to  provide a much safer environment for society. I support the sentiments of the  motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I thank Members opposite for proposing the motion, which I  fully support. I also thank the Member who proposed the motion for clarifying  her position regarding pubs and clubs taking their share of the responsibility  in dealing with this issue. Perhaps the Minister will also take on board the point  regarding DPPs and councils.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The term &ldquo;date rape&rdquo; was first used in a magazine article  in 1982. The term refers to rape perpetrated by a person who is known to the  victim. Date rape is a brutal, and, sadly,  common crime. It is evil and cowardly. Incidents of date rapes are  rapidly increasing and must be treated seriously. Drugs are also being  increasingly used to render a victim incapable of resisting &mdash; or even  remembering anything about &mdash; an attack.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People from all walks of life need to be made aware of the  drugs that are increasingly used in instances of rape. Drugs such as ketamine &mdash;  which was developed as an animal tranquiliser and anaesthetic &mdash; affect the  central nervous system and can take effect in 10 to 20 minutes when added to  alcohol. Rohypnol is another example; it has a sedative effect, can be  administered as a powder added to a drink, and is also used as an anaesthetic.  Its effects are also intensified when added to alcohol.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Gamma hydroxy butyrate (GHB) is a drug that is odourless,  colourless and is perhaps the most dangerous of all. It affects the brain and  induces dizziness, incoherent speech, and, if too much of it is consumed, it  can even induce coma and heart seizures.  GHB can be created by an amateur chemist using advice that can, unfortunately,  be downloaded from the Internet. It is a dangerous drug, and those who use it  are aware that it can be a killer drug.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the most dangerous drug of all is alcohol. In modern society, pub crawling and clubbing,  associated with the consumption of large amounts of inexpensive alcohol,  is part of almost eery young person&rsquo;s social experience.  The price of alcohol needs to be considered, not just for general  health, but also in order to help to address this issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sexual predators can easily find soft targets. It is sad to  think that young people are being stalked by evil people who have no remorse,  no moral component, no regard for their defenceless victim and no fear of the  law or the courts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Educating young people is important, especially as to the  dangers of alcohol and heavy drinking. They must receive timely warnings and  advice on self-protection. There are various date-rape prevention kits, some of  which include personal alarms, Mace sprays and  a variety of devices to prevent drinks being tampered with. It is each young person&rsquo;s to responsibility  to avail of &mdash; and provide themselves with &mdash; the protection that they may  need.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As public representatives, we can ensure that young people  are offered help, support and advice. We can support and further develop  awareness programmes that impress on young people the need to take sensible  precautions when going out to pubs or clubs. Advice that can be offered  includes: go out with friends and come home  together with friends; keep an eye on friends during the evening; never  leave drinks unattended; never accept an open drink from a stranger; and call  the police immediately if there is a suspicion that someone has been drugged.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Rape is one of the most  serious offences that a person can commit. Often, it goes unpunished  because the victims are afraid to go to the police. They feel a sense of shame;  they fear having to describe and relive the event; they fear that their family,  friends or employers will treat them in an unsympathetic or even hostile  manner; and they fear being mocked by their attacker as they stand in court,  reliving the horror of the attack. Rape sentences the victim to a lifetime of  fear, damage and distress. More often than not, the predator walks away  undiscovered, unnamed and unpunished. It is a brutal crime that is made even  worse when drugs are used to make the victim  unable to resist or offer defence.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is not enough for Members to stand in the  Chamber and offer informed and sympathetic advice;  it is not enough to simply debate the availability of date-rape kits; it  is not enough to offer our sympathy after the event. It is time to take the war  to the enemy. We need to put fear of retribution in the mind of the  perpetrators. There is little evidence that those who commit sexual crime can  be successfully rehabilitated. The victim is sentenced to, and has to endure, a  life sentence of psychological and emotional damage.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When people are convicted, we must do all in our power to ensure that retribution is related to  the enormity of the crime. We must ensure that those who have been  brutalised can have confidence in the police and in the justice system when  they have the courage to report such crimes. The system must do more to protect  the victim, and much more to punish those responsible for such crimes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If devolution is to mean anything, we must have the power  to treat sexual predators, date rapists and those who prey on innocent children  with the severity that those offences  merit. We must ensure that the Assembly spells out its intention to work  in every possible way to support victims of  crime and ensure that the punishment fits the crime.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  The SDLP supports the motion. However, although we recognise that there is some  evidence of an increase in the use of date-rape drugs, we share the concerns of  many Members about a culture of binge drinking.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Recent research by the University of Ulster, and an article  in the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; in November last year about a study of drug rape, indicate that the overwhelming majority of people who had come forward with  allegations of rape had been between two and three times over the legal  alcohol limit for driving.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Minister and his colleagues will look to  the Investing for Health strategy and bring together Departments to try to  educate not only children &mdash; as many Members have said &mdash; but parents. I am sure  that, in every constituency, stories circulate of parents purchasing alcohol  for young children. Some think it acceptable that alcohol should be provided  for young children and under-age drinkers. Shame on them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have seen a great campaign aimed at educating people  about the dangers of tobacco and smoking, but a similar message has still to be  driven home about the long-term impact of alcohol abuse. I ask the Minister to  consider the establishment of a forum to take forward such work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All parties represented in the Assembly have the  opportunity to have their say on the provisions of the draft Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland)  Order 2007, not only with the respect to date rape, but in respect of the  definition of when a rape has occurred. If someone is so drunk that they cannot  give rational consent, that should be considered when deciding whether consent  was given or whether sexual assault or rape has been committed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members commented on the type of detection kits that  are available. The Minister is aware that community-safety partnerships &mdash; at  least in Craigavon &mdash; supplied bottle stoppers two years ago.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a need for interdepartmental co-operation, but the NIO&rsquo;s community safety unit also has a  respons&shy;ibility because it may have money to put towards such projects.  The proposers of the motion recognise the difficulties of providing such kits,  free of charge, from the health budget, and have stressed that that is not what  they are asking for. However, the NIO could be a source of money for that  purpose, because a precedent has already been established, and it has  considered that measure in the past.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure whether  the Minister&rsquo;s Department runs the current television advertisements  about Christmas parties and how people are getting out-of-their-minds drunk. Perhaps the money for those advertisements  comes from some other source. However, that advertising campaign appears  to be driving the message home. Does the Minister have any plans to establish  such a campaign on a longer-term basis, to drive home the message about date  rape, the undue influence that alcohol has on behaviour and the consequences of  being unable to make informed decisions when drunk?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP, therefore, supports the motion, but would welcome  a cross-departmental strategy to tackle the societal problems that binge  drinking poses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I commend the Department of the Environment on  its campaign against drink-driving. Reports have shown that drugs are  increasingly involved in such cases.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>Date rape is not  just connected to unusual drugs used specifically for that purpose</strong>: people  also take recreational drugs and prescribed medication, which affect alcohol  uptake and physiological interactions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Thair hes aye been badness i this worl&rsquo;, fae the faa thon furst tim&rsquo; i Eden&rsquo;s  Gairden. A wus raired i tims tha&rsquo; mae gran&rsquo;parents alloed wurnae laike thair  day, an&rsquo; yet leukin beck oan thaim the day they leuk tae bae idyllic compeered  tae quhat oor young fowk the day cum ap agin. Hit leuks laike thaim wi&rsquo; evil  notions hae mair tools than iver afore tae heft thaim tae cairry oot thair  disgustin&rsquo; purposes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There has always been evil in the world, since the first  fall in the Garden of Eden. I grew up in times that my grandparents bemoaned as  not the same as their era, yet as I look back on them they seem idyllic in comparison to what young people face today. It  appears that those with evil intentions have more tools than ever to  help them carry out their disgusting purposes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the proposers for tabling the motion. I am aware  of the circumstances of certain people in my area and of what nearly happened  to them, which could have been worse but for the actions of their friends.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Due to the rising number of rape cases in the UK, a scheme  was implemented in schools whereby girls of 15 and 16 were given self-defence  classes in PE. The scheme made sense; it gave participants the tools to fight  off an attacker, scream and run for help. As with everything else, that is no  longer enough. The self-defence classes were laudable, but not sufficient to  provide a fighting chance against someone with evil intent towards a woman, who  must deal with not only brute strength but drinks spiked with drugs that make  her pliable and forgetful.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not a chemist, and I will not even attempt to  pronounce some of the ingredients that are used in the drug cocktails; other  Members have already said what they are. There are 27 drugs that may be used to  spike drinks; the main problem is that many of those drugs are tasteless and  colourless, and even those with taste and colour may be masked by putting them  in a strong cocktail, so that in many cases the victim is none the wiser.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is highlighted consistently through the medium of TV  advertisements and, to some extent, through soap operas. In recent years, the  publicity around date-rape drugs has been stronger. I do not watch soap operas,  but my wife does, and she tells me that those issues have been addressed in  &lsquo;Emmerdale&rsquo; and, for the younger audience, in &lsquo;Hollyoaks&rsquo;. I am reliably  informed by the girls in my office that the soaps have given advice in a manner  that also shows the dangers of the abuse of alcohol in those situations, as  well as offering practical advice such as ensuring that your journey is  pre-planned and that others know where you are, what you are doing and when you  are going home.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is backed up in certain schools where teachers are  taking the time in class to explain the dangers and signals of alcohol overuse  and drug use. Pupils are also given invaluable advice, such as to stay in  groups. In 2006 in Northern    Ireland, some 40 cases were reported to the  Roofie Foundation, although it must be pointed out that the majority of women  and men who are sexually attacked do not tell anyone, especially if they feel  somewhat to blame, as is the case with many girls.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been shown that of those who have rung the helpline,  only 10% to 15% will inform the police and take the case further, which also  gives cause for worry and concern. The Rape Crisis and Sexual Abuse Centre  estimates that up to two women a week are raped using drugs in Northern Ireland.  The number of times that drugs are used to attack girls is unquantifiable. It  is estimated that in the UK  some 754,000 women over the age the 16 have been the victim of drug-related  sexual assault. It is unclear how many of those happen in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are prevention kits; one gadget, referred to as a Spika Stoppa, seals a bottle to allow liquid to  come out through a straw but nothing to go back in. I ask the Minister to implement a push of that type of  gadget into clubs, to ensure that the  clubs work alongside the Minister so that people are protected and are  drinking sensibly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have read conflicting opinions about the usefulness and  accuracy of the drug-testing kits on the market. However, research suggests  that the drink-tester used by the police was much more accurate than other  detectors. Therefore, the Minister should implement research to determine the  effectiveness of the police test and, if necessary, introduce such testers into  clubs and bars as a priority.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not so naive that I would believe that tests alone  will stop all attacks. A combination of tests and publicity to raise awareness  among people of all ages, which is not just directed at young people, is  needed. It has been shown that those who are most at risk include women who are  at house parties, not necessarily clubs, and who are in their thirties. Such an  awareness and advice campaign must be combined with a concerted effort by the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to provide any device  that would lessen the risk. I urge Members  to support the proposal.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  It is a strange experience to debate the need for such kits, which can detect  drugs that leave those who are unfortunate enough to take them so physically  incapable that assaults of such heinous proportions can occur. I condemn  outright the perpetrators of such cowardly attacks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although there is no question of the necessity to legislate  to outlaw some of those substances, it is also sensible to make people aware of  the problem of so-called date rape. Date rape is rape &mdash; it as simple as that.  One case is no different from the other when it comes to the trauma that it  causes the victim. Society must get the message, loud and clear, that that is  not acceptable. Some people may wonder why  the Assembly is discussing the issue. If anyone thinks that, he or she  should speak to a rape victim, who may have been drugged as well. It is also  worth noting that although rape is usually  considered to be a crime against women, men can also be victims.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although prevention  kits are a useful tool in tackling that crime, some research has not  been supportive of them. The 2005 &lsquo;Drink-spiking Report&rsquo; by Liverpool John   Moores University  into the effectiveness of the proposed kits found that they cannot be relied  upon. Research was conducted for the study under laboratory conditions. That makes the results even more  frightening. If the kits show poor reliability under ideal conditions,  it casts doubt on their effectiveness in the settings in which they are <strong>designed to be used. That does not mean that  they should not be used</strong>: however, any kit&rsquo;s usefulness must be evaluated before it is issued to ensure that  it serves the purpose for which it is designed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Advice on people&rsquo;s drinking habits should also be more firmly emphasised and available. I appreciate  that young people, in particular, consider those who offer such advice  to be killjoys and fail to understand that there is genuine concern for their  personal well-being and safety. If people must drink, they should be aware that  they are more susceptible to crimes such as rape.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Research that was published by the University of Ulster  in October 2007 indicates that alcohol, either alone or combined with  prescription drugs, is a major factor in assaults. The study also found that  during the six-year period that it covered, there were no cases of the use of  GHB, Rohypnol and ketamine in toxicology reports. That is why a multi-stranded  approach should be employed to tackle such  despicable crimes. Certainly, well-tested and reliable detector kits  should be made available. However, the message must be put across that alcohol  is a major factor in many rape cases. I urge young people and others to be as  vigilant as possible when out socialising in nightclubs and pubs &mdash; particularly  at this time of the year &mdash; so that that heinous crime can be detected and  eradicated. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety (Mr McGimpsey): At the outset, I want to  make it clear that anyone who spikes another person&rsquo;s drink or food  behaves in a wholly unacceptable and disgraceful way. That behaviour must not  be tolerated by society, especially when it is used to take advantage of  someone and to commit a serious sexual assault, such as rape.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Spiking someone&rsquo;s food or drink is a crime and a breach of  trust that may affect the victim&rsquo;s mental health and well-being for the rest of  that person&rsquo;s life. Drink-spiking and the use of date-rape drugs should be everyone&rsquo;s concern. I thank the two Sinn F&eacute;in  Members who raised the issue for giving the Assembly the opportunity to  discuss it in more detail. It is a complex subject. The Assembly must ensure  that any action that is taken by Government is effective and worthwhile.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although spiking drinks can take place for a range of  reasons, including a so-called &ldquo;prank&rdquo; that is played on friends, it is usually  seen as an attempt to take sexual advantage of someone. The relatively new term  &ldquo;date rape&rdquo; is appalling, and is one of which modern society should be ashamed.  The term refers to rape, or non-consensual  sexual activity, between people who are known to each other, and it can  be either spontaneous or premeditated. In some cases, date-rape drugs are  slipped into food or drink in order to remove a person&rsquo;s resistance or render  him or her unconscious, so that the perpetrator can assault his or her victim.  Those drugs, whether they be gammahydroxybutyrate (GHB), ketamine, Rohypnol or  alcohol, can often affect the victim&rsquo;s memory of the event and make it  difficult to prosecute the perpetrator.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Police in Northern    Ireland do not record statistics for rapes that are alleged to have  been drug-assisted. There is anecdotal information that levels of  drink-spiking have increased. However, when one considers the nature of the  subject, it is extremely difficult to get any measure of the current level of  drink-spiking, or to determine whether it is a growing trend. Therefore, it is  important that we make the best assessment of the degree to which it is a  problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A UK  study found that 2% of a total of 1,014 rape victims actually had their drinks  spiked. Most victims of that type of sexual assault go to the police, or for a medical evaluation, hours after the incident has  occurred and, usually, after waking up the next morning. A time lapse of 10 to 12 hours is common. By that point,  in many cases, evidence of drugging may be gone. In other cases, the incident  may not be reported at all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the lack of evidence of the level of drink-spiking  does not mean that there are not significant risks, or that we should not be taking  it seriously. I take the issue very  seriously and it is one that my Department has been addressing over many  years. I am conscious that a lot of time, energy and money is being spent in  making Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  towns and city centres safe for entertainment and socialising. It is vital that  all our citizens, male and female, are able to go out and enjoy themselves  safely.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since 2000, my Department has funded the Health Promotion  Agency to develop and roll out information campaigns on drink-spiking. A series  of high-profile posters have been designed and located in prominent places in  bars and clubs throughout Northern    Ireland. When  those posters were being designed, the experiences and views of the  target group &mdash; the young people who go to pubs and clubs &mdash; were taken on board.  Two posters deal specifically with keeping safe. One carries the strapline,  &ldquo;Never leave your drink unattended&rdquo;, and a  more recent poster, which specifically targets women, highlights how  excessive use of alcohol or drugs can make a person particularly vulnerable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Both campaigns encourage people to look after one another and watch over each other&rsquo;s drinks.  Evaluations of the campaigns have been very promising, and the message  that one should not leave drinks unattended has been picked up by the young  adults who were surveyed as part of the evaluation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My impression is that young adults are, in general, aware  of the risks and that most take the necessary precautions. The message, &ldquo;Never  leave your drink unattended&rdquo; strikes a chord among the generation who frequent pubs and clubs. Excessive use of alcohol  leaves people in the position in  which they are unable to protect their  drinks. Apart from any concerns about drugs, there is increasing concern that spiking drinks with  additional alcohol is becoming a more significant problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Excessive alcohol  consumption by males and females makes them more vulnerable to unwanted  attentions and can also alter their ability to make decisions. Research by the  University of Ulster, which examined alleged sexual assaults over the period  1995 to 2005, concluded that young women in Northern Ireland are leaving  themselves vulnerable to rape or serious sexual assault because of their binge  drinking. The research findings showed that the average alcohol level at the  time of an alleged assault was almost three times that of the drink-driving  limit. The study also failed to find any trace of specific date-rape drugs such  as GHB, Rohypnol or ketamine. However, the  report did caution that delays in reporting alleged assaults and in  taking samples of bodily fluids, could mean that such drugs might no longer be  detected.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must acknowledge that excessive alcohol consumption  increases a person&rsquo;s tendency to take risks and to put themselves at greater  risk from others.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To that end, further to  the successful public-awareness campaign,  we are also working with the drinks industry, particularly on efforts to  encourage bar staff to refuse to serve alcohol to someone who has clearly  already had enough. My Department is implementing the new strategic direction for alcohol and drugs, and  the strategy&rsquo;s aim is to reduce the level of alcohol- and drug-related  harm. It also focuses on young people&rsquo;s drinking.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>It is important to  note that 70% of all adults in Northern Ireland drink</strong>: 75% of men and 67% of women. Some  43% of male drinkers and 33% of female drinkers currently binge-drink,  and those figures increase to 63% of males and 50% of females among  18-year-olds to 29-year-olds. Therefore,  one of the Department&rsquo;s key focuses is on reducing excessive alcohol  consumption. Binge drinking carries with it a range of risks, which is why we  have undertaken a regional public-information campaign to tackle it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Shannon mentioned how times have changed. Over the past generation, the range of alcoholic  products and the number of outlets that sell alcohol have grown  dramatically, yet the relative cost of alcohol has decreased dramatically.  Those factors, combined with powerful advertising campaigns for alcoholic  drinks, mean that we, as a society, are drinking much more.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that several  date-rape prevention products are on the market, and I understand the  strength of feeling that is out there. However, I must also point out that  there is a lack of evidence on their performance. In June 2005, Liverpool John Moores   University&rsquo;s centre for  public health published its &lsquo;Drink-spiking Report&rsquo;. Two date-rape prevention  products were assessed: Drink Detective, which costs &pound;2&middot;95, and Drink Guard.  The report stated:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Neither testing kit was consistently successful.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It went on to say that both kits failed to detect the  presence of drugs on occasions, and that they also returned false positives  when no drug was present. The report concluded:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Based on these findings we do not believe that either  Drink Detective or Drink Guard should be recommended for use.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therein lies the problem, which is to find a drinks-testing  product that works. There are clearly serious ramifications if a test shows  that a drink has been tampered with when it has not been, or if it shows that a  drink has not been tampered with when it has been. That could lead to serious  problems, so that key hurdle must be overcome if we are to provide safe testing  kits.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The other problem is that the overwhelming drug of choice  for spiking drinks is alcohol. Bottle stoppers were also mentioned. They are  available and have been successful. However, most people drink out of glasses  rather than bottles, and that makes preventing drinks being spiked more  difficult.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sue Ramsey mentioned the need to gather relevant bodies  together, and that is important. We are working on that; in fact, the regional  alcohol and drug forum will meet next week.  That body is an important vehicle, and it can be effective, as can the  binge drinking advisory group.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is that people drink too much. The drinks  industry is very powerful, so, in order to address the problem, we must attempt  to work with the industry and to educate individuals about the damage that  excessive alcohol consumption causes. Alcohol misuse has serious consequences,  and the heavy price of excessive alcohol consumption is borne by the Health  Service and society. Figures show that alcohol misuse resulted in 246 deaths in  2005, and it results in around 7,000 admissions each year to acute hospitals. I  take seriously the problem of alcohol misuse. I am always looking for ways in  which to move forward, and drinks-testing kits may be part of a solution, if we  can find products that are absolutely effective.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, education, advertising, the promotion of better and healthier lifestyles and the proper  and sensible use of alcohol will  offer a more productive way forward for the Health Service.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms J McCann: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. I thank my colleague Sue Ramsey for opening the debate. Many  relevant points have been made, and I hope  that I will be able to cover all of them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The addition of alcohol or drugs to someone&rsquo;s drink in  order to render them semi-conscious and facilitate rape or sexual assault is  commonly known as drink-spiking. It has become an increasingly worrying trend  in recent years. Very often, the unsuspecting victim will not be aware until it  is too late that his or her drink has been spiked. Incapacity may be mistaken  for drunkenness, which allows the predator who spiked the drink to go  unchallenged when he or she leaves with the individual concerned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the suggestion made by a Member that training of  bar staff, particularly doormen, might help to address the situation. The most  commonly used drugs in drink-spiking  incidents are GHB and ketamine, but alcohol is often added to  non-alcoholic drinks. Some Members mentioned people going into bars, but not  everyone who goes into a bar takes an alcoholic drink. It is important to  remember that some people go in for a soft drink, which can often be spiked  with an alcoholic drink.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The long-term devastating effects of rape and sexual  assault are well documented. People must be aware of the dangers of  drink-spiking, and measures must be put in place to protect them. Mr Buchanan  said that a joined-up approach was required  to move things forward. His colleague Mr George Robinson pointed out  that men, as well as women, can be victims of drug-related rape. Those are  important points.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Shannon talked about the perpetrators; another Member  criticised the sentences handed down to people convicted of such criminal  offences, and said that we should send out a clear message. I concur with that  sentiment; sentences for convicted rapists are not stiff enough.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We ask today that Government play their part in this  campaign, and take the lead in providing drink-spiking prevention kits, free of  charge. Some Members have asked for a joined-up approach &mdash; that the vintner&rsquo;s  associations and the owners of bars and nightclubs should take responsibility to ensure that their customers are  protected. Although drink-spiking prevention kits can help to detect whether  something has been added to a drink, they are not meant to be used as  protection against drink-spiking. People must take their own preventative  measures.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members mentioned binge drinking. Mrs Kelly and the  Minister pointed out that it is not always perceived as being as big a problem  as drugs misuse. Although binge drinking is a problem, the debate today  concerns drink-spiking and the related use of alcohol and drugs. Other Members have made valid points about educating  young people, and the Minister mentioned his Department&rsquo;s drugs and alcohol  strategies. It is important that those campaigns continue, and that people are educated about the dangers of binge  drinking.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ms Ramsey pointed out that the kits that we ask for are prevention  kits. They should provide information on preventative measures as well as  practical items. Several Members mentioned the plug that is on sale for 50p  from some of the drug and alcohol misuse centres. Many young people who drink  in bars use that plug, which fits on the top of the bottle so that the contents  can be drunk only through a straw.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A project in England allows people who feel that  they, or a friend, have had a drink spiked to text the number of an  organisation that can give them access to help straight away. That might be  another initiative that we could consider introducing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People should never leave their drinks unattended, and if  people need to go somewhere without their drinks, they should ensure that  someone that they trust watches them until they return. If that is not  possible, the drinks should be discarded. People should not let a stranger buy  them a drink, and they should be watchful of the person who is serving the  drinks because there have been cases in which drinks have been spiked by the  person who was serving behind the bar.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although things can be done to prevent drinks from being  spiked, people may still be at risk. Going out with other people and watching  out for one another can help. Last year, an initiative in west Belfast encouraged women to travel home  together and to ensure that their friends  were dropped off at their front doors. Such small initiatives are preventative measures that people  can take.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members said that particular attention must be paid  at Christmas. At that time of year, people tend to let their guard down and  relax more. Simple steps can be followed. If someone is behaving out of  character and seems to be really out of it, friends should not simply assume  that the person is drunk, as they may need immediate medical assistance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The use of legal and illegal drugs to spike drinks is a big  problem because they are so readily available in local communities. The  problems associated with ketamine have been publicised in recent weeks. It is important to point out that most people who are  involved in community-drugs  programmes will say that drugs are more  widely available now than they were a year ago.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In summary, the points that were made during the debate  were positive, particularly the call for joined-up thinking on this issue. That  means that all citizens, male or female, have the right to be safe. The poster  campaign that the Minister mentioned, which is targeted particularly at young people, has been evaluated as  being highly beneficial.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank all Members for taking part in the debate, and I am  glad that the motion seems to have  cross-party support, and perhaps the full support of the Assembly. I  hope that the motion is passed. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><strong>Resolved</strong>:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly, in view of the increase in  &lsquo;spiking&rsquo; of drinks, calls on the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety to provide for date rape prevention kits to be made available  free of charge.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="5"></a>Royal Commission &mdash; United Kingdom</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: The Business Committee has agreed to  allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion  will have 10 minutes to propose and 10 minutes for a winding-up speech. All  other Members who are called to speak will have five minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Two amendments have been received and published on the  Marshalled List. The proposer of each amend&shy;ment will have 10 minutes to  propose and five minutes for a winding-up speech.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Savage: I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly believes, following devolution in Northern  Ireland, Scotland and Wales, that a Royal Commission should be appointed to  review the steps that need to be taken to maintain the unity of England,  Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s election manifesto of 2007  stated that our party was:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Advocating a Royal Commission to strengthen the Union  &mdash; and build the partnership between Westminster  and the devolved Administrations.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Along with my party, I am interested &mdash; if not concerned &mdash;  about the constitutional composition of the United Kingdom. It is deeply  concerning that every devolved Government in  the United Kingdom  is headed by nationalists of some type. In Wales, Plaid Cymru is in  coalition with Labour. In Scotland,  the SNP forms a minority Government, and in Northern Ireland, the Executive  comprise an uneasy collation of Ulster nationalists and Irish nationalists.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For that reason, the Ulster Unionist Party wants to ensure  the continuance of the Union, which lies at the core of being a unionist. One  of our central aims is to promote, strengthen and maintain the Union.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Salmond and the Scottish National Party represent the  greatest threat to the maintenance of the United Kingdom.  The SNP&rsquo;s website has a section dedicated to independence, in which it  is argued that <strong>it is time for the  Scottish Parliament to have</strong>:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;full control over Scottish affairs and the right to  decide when to share power with others.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The SNP believes that despite devolution, the &ldquo;new  level of democracy&rdquo; is &ldquo;limited&rdquo;, and that restricts how much can be achieved  for the people of Scotland.  The following quote from the SNP is most worrying:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The 300-year old  Union is no longer fit for purpose. It was never designed for the 21st  century world. It is well past its sell by date and is holding Scotland back.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That displays  an interesting logic. Many academics and scholars consider that the constitution of the United States  is not fit for purpose: it is old, vague, and, in some parts, oblique. However,  there are few, if any, calls to scrap the US constitution.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In August 2007, a White Paper entitled &lsquo;Choosing Scotland&rsquo;s  Future: A National Conversation: Indepen&shy;dence and Responsibility in the Modern  World.&rsquo; was published. The following comment from an Irish home ruler Charles  Stewart Parnell appears at the start of the document:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;No man has a  right to fix the boundary of the march of a nation; no man has a right  to say to his country, &lsquo;Thus far shalt thou go and no further&rsquo;&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The summary of the section entitled &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Moutray: Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Savage: No, I will not. There will be plenty of time  for the Member to speak when I have finished.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The summary of the section entitled: &ldquo;Extending Scottish  devolution&rdquo; states:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Significant powers  are currently reserved to the United Kingdom  Parliament and the United    Kingdom Government. Further devolution  in these important areas would allow the Scottish Parliament and Scottish  Government to take their own decisions on these issues in the interests of Scotland and reflecting the views of the people  of Scotland.  In some areas, further devolution could also provide greater coherence in  decision-making and democratic accountability for delivery of policy.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The document outlines a variety of areas to which  it is hoped that devolution can be extended, examples of which include taxation  and spending responsibilities; anti-terrorism legislation; legislation on  firearms; misuse of drugs; the level of pension for the older population; the regulation of the major health professions;  the taxation of tobacco and alcohol; and the Civil Service in Scotland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That list clearly indicates the intention of the SNP&rsquo;s  Administration to attempt to use devolution to <strong>weaken the Union. In last night&rsquo;s &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo;, Alex Salmond said</strong>:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;When Scotland  becomes independent, England  will lose its surly lodger and gain a good neighbour.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I urge Members to look up the definition of  &ldquo;surly&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 03 July 2007, the Westminster Government published a  Green Paper entitled &lsquo;The Governance of Britain&rsquo;, which sought to address two  basic questions: how to hold to account those in power, and how to uphold and  enhance the rights and responsibilities of the citizen. Paragraph 143 states:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Devolution does not cede ultimate sovereignty. The  decisions Parliament takes have consequences for all the people of our nation.  The great strength of our constitution is its effectiveness. It can accommodate  difference and rough edges in support of wider goals of national unity,  affiliation to the institutions of the state and the service of those  institutions to the public.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">&lsquo;The Governance of Britain&rsquo; Green Paper restates the supremacy and sovereignty of Parliament.  However, it fails to address adequately the relationship between Westminster and the  devolved Administrations. For that reason, a Royal Commission should be  appointed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>Gordon Brown has  gone on record as saying</strong>:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There is a debate to be had about the future of the United Kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, when one considers the arguments, family  ties, economic connections, shared values and history of our relationship, which has lasted for over 300 years, people  will decide that we are stronger together and weaker apart: united we stand,  divided we fall; what we have, we hold. I have one simple message for those who  wish to destroy and dismantle our most excellent union: no surrender to the  break-up of the United    Kingdom. I commend the motion to the House.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Some Members: Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Hamilton: I beg to move amendment No 1: Leave out  all after &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo; and insert</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;notes the proposal within the Government Green Paper, &lsquo;The  Governance of Britain&rsquo;, to develop a British statement of values; welcomes the  strong emphasis of the Executive, reinforced within the draft Programme for Government, to fortify links in the East-West  dimension between Northern Ireland and Great Britain; and believes, following  devolution in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, that a Royal Commission  should be appointed to review the steps that need to be taken to promote  further the unity of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland within the  United Kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I hope that Members on the Ulster Unionist Benches  agree that the amendment enhances the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome this  opportunity &mdash; indeed, any opportunity &mdash; to underscore the benefits of  the Union. Unless Members are in any doubt, I am an avowed unionist and not an  Ulster nationalist, whatever that may be. If my colleagues and I stand charged  of trying to seek the best possible deal for Northern Ireland within the Union,  we are guilty of that charge but not of any other silly titles that people  might level at us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Like many of a unionist  persuasion, I became involved in active politics partly because of a  perceived threat to the very existence of the Union. For me, it was the Belfast  Agreement. For others, it was the Anglo-Irish Agreement  or even the Sunningdale Agreement. Perhaps some go further back, but I  do not think that there is anyone on these Benches who can quite remember the Ulster Covenant, although there may be some  Members who could surprise us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For half a century or more, unionists have often had cause  to believe that the Union&rsquo;s days were numbered, and, at times, who could blame them? They were under the cosh of  terrorism, betrayed by their Government and let down by their leaders.  Fortunately, those days are gone. I hope  that the intention of the Ulster Unionist Party in bringing the motion  to the Floor is to celebrate the Union and see a way in which it can endure. It  is worth celebrating, and the fact that the retention of the Union enjoys such  widespread support across our community must be celebrated.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion refers to maintaining the Union in a manner that  suggested that there was a threat to it. At times during the proposer&rsquo;s speech,  I felt that I had been transported to Edinburgh.  Now that the IRA has been defeated and Irish republicanism is in its weakest  state in living memory, beaten on both sides of the Irish border, we should not  start to panic about the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Now is not the time for defeatists and doom merchants,  although I suspect that some may still exist. I do not wish to go too far down  this route, but it is laughable that the  Ulster Unionist Party seeks to portray itself as some sort of steadfast  defender of the Union, when it has such an appalling track record.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Between 1998 and 2003,  the Union was undermined, symbolically  and substantively, by the acquiescence of the Ulster Unionist Party. The Union  flag was removed from public buildings, the name and symbols of the Royal  Ulster Constabulary were ditched, good old-fashioned British democracy was  tainted by the presence of terrorist representatives in our Government and  unaccountable all-Ireland institutions were established.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am happy to say that those dark, gloomy days when the  Union was under threat are long gone, and I am happy to welcome the Ulster  Unionist Party in its refound support for the Union.  Welcome back, boys. It is good to have you back.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Support for the Union is  strong. A BBC &lsquo;Hearts and Minds&rsquo; survey conducted in November 2006 found that  82% of unionists and almost 40% of nationalists believed that Northern Ireland  would still be part of the United Kingdom in 2020. That level of support was  the highest recorded to the same question since 1998.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is no coincidence that that huge level of belief in the Union was secured during the DUP&rsquo;s tenure as the leader  of unionism; contrasting with the low level of 61% in May 2000 in the midst of  the Trimble and Empey era. The figures were  backed up by the Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey in June, which  showed that 54% of all people in Northern Ireland  supported the Union and only 30% preferred a united Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Even 22% of Catholics surveyed &mdash; over one in five &mdash;  favoured the retention of the constitutional link between Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.  It is little wonder that the Irish Minister  for Foreign Affairs was recently forced to admit that the constitutional  question has been parked.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Sinn F&eacute;in mantra of having a united Ireland by 2016 completely lacks credibility. Today, nine  years from that target date, Sinn  F&eacute;in representatives sit in Stormont, exercise British power in part of  the United Kingdom&rsquo;s  political system and support the Police Service of Northern Ireland and British  justice &mdash; that is what Gerry McHugh would say. A united Ireland is a pipe dream, and support for the Union will get stronger &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Attwood: I beg to move amendment No 2: Leave out all  after the first &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;  and insert:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;that the democratic requirements of the principle of  consent will determine any change in the constitutional status of Northern  Ireland; believes in the deepening of relationships between the people of these  islands; encourages policy engagement and joint actions among the different administrations in these islands,  and on this island; and calls for the  significant expansion of North-South areas of co-operation and joint  implementation.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unlike the previous Member who spoke, I do not intend to  rubbish the views of anyone who expresses their opinions in the debate &mdash; these  matters are too important and too sensitive, and people hold too many deep  values for those sorts of comments to be made in any speech in this Chamber.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the SDLP opposes the motion, it is not diminishing  the fact that people who value the Union have  reasons to assess what it means to them. The old certainties of the Union &mdash; the  British empire, the monarchy, and Westminster rule in all parts of what is  referred to as the United Kingdom &mdash; have changed utterly. The British   empire has gone, the monarchy has changed, and one Parliament is  no longer responsible for four jurisdictions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP acknowledges that there may be reasons why those  who value the Union want an assessment of what  it means. As George Savage said, given the rise of the SNP, the presence of  Welsh nationalists in the Welsh Government, and the fact that a constitutional  position has now been agreed for the North, there may be more fundamental changes to the nature of the Union.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has three  reasons for opposing the motion. First, there cannot be debates about  the future of the Union or the future unity of Ireland &mdash; both must be part of the  same debate. There cannot be a debate that is narrowly defined by either the Union or Irish unity. If we are going to have a debate,  let it cover all the issues that people have.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, it must be recognised where politics now resides.  Politics in the North has moved on from <strong>only  being about the Union</strong>: it is now about the three sets of relationships that  historically made up our political conflict  and that now are the basis of political agreement; the relationships  between North and South, Britain and Ireland, and between the communities in  the North. I say to the proposers of the motion and amendment No 1 that  anything that does not address the fact that that is the nature of our past  conflict, and will consequently be part of the future political solution,  disregards something that is very important.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, any motion that discusses the Union  but does not address the reality of politics that Members practice everyday in  the Chamber does a disservice to the debate in general. Only yesterday, the  Minister of Finance and Personnel outlined proposals for European funding, in  the border counties in the South and the west of Scotland as well as in the North.  Every week, motions are proposed and reports are made about the British-Irish Council,  and sectoral meetings of the North/South Ministerial Council. Anything that  disregards how Members practice everyday politics does a disservice to the  issues regarding the future of the Union that  the proposers of the motion and amendment No 1 want to discuss.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the SDLP will oppose the motion. There are also  many good reasons why Members should support the SDLP amendment: it recognises  the new constitutional situation in the North, the diverse relationships that  exist between these islands and the real politics that involve all the parties  in the Chamber. The SDLP amendment touches all the necessary bases for a  proper, informed and embracing debate with prejudice  to nobody in respect of the future of the Union  or the future of Irish unity.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: I  apologise to Simon Hamilton for  cutting him short: I assure him that it was not political. Likewise, Alex Attwood cut himself short. Each  Member should have been allowed 10 minutes to propose their amendments.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure how that can be interpreted, but I call  Martina Anderson.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms Anderson: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom labhairt in &eacute;adan an r&uacute;in seo agus taca&iacute;ocht a  thabhairt do leas&uacute; an SDLP. I apologise to the House for being late.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not support the motion, and I speak in support of the  SDLP amendment. No one in the Chamber will be surprised to hear that as a  republican Member of the Assembly who is committed to the constitutional  reunification of Ireland &mdash; North and South &mdash; I do not support the motion  calling for a Royal Commission to outline  the steps to maintain what some call &ldquo;the Union&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The dislocation of the United Kingdom has been a slow but  steady process since its inception. Indeed, the Union  has always been a concept under stress. The 1801 Act of Union was challenged by  the second rebellion of the United Irishmen in 1803. That stimulated successive  insurrections &mdash; all of which had debilitating political consequences for Ireland&rsquo;s part in any union with Britain. I  remind Members that they would not be sitting in a democratic Assembly if it  were not intrinsically grafted to an all-Ireland executive body. Therefore the  notion that the Six Counties is part of some insular set-up with Britain that  can be supported by a Royal Commission is a forlorn hope, and it is  disconnected from reality.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Six Counties remain constitutionally linked to  the island of Britain politically, socially,  infrastructurally and economically, it is becoming increasingly integrated with  the rest of this island &mdash; and that is a fact. It is doing so for the best of  reasons: for the common good and for the mutual benefits of all our people. For  the first time since the Act of Union of 1801, we are an island united in how  we govern ourselves, through agreed and evolving structures outlined in the  Good Friday Agreement, with strand two mapping out how we can pool sovereignty  for the benefits of the whole island.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the island of Britain, the Union is dislocating through the transfer of powers to the Scottish  Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales. The unitary state in Britain is  history: it is politically dead. Any develop&shy;ments in Britain regarding the Union  are firmly beyond the control of anyone in this Assembly. The Scottish Labour  Party, the Welsh Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish Conservative  Party and the Welsh Conservative Party agree on one thing: to stay politically  relevant in their respective local assemblies, they must advocate more  autonomy. The process will not stand still or be hindered. The destination of  the process of dislocation on the island  of Britain does not lie with a  desperate collection of politicians in a Royal Commission, but with the  sovereign will of the people of Scotland,  Wales and, increasingly, the  people of England  &mdash; many of whom are pushing for some form of English assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Welsh Assembly now supports the finding of the Richard Commission, which calls for that  Assembly to have powers equivalent to those of the Scottish Parliament.  The Scottish Parliament has outlined the parameters for a national conversation  on Scotland&rsquo;s  future, and there are only two real areas on the table for debate: a  significant increase in the powers of the Scottish Parliament, and national  independence.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Standing still is not an  option. Indeed, even the recent Steel Commission, which examined fiscal  practices across the EU, recommended, among other things, a form of fiscal  federalism that would see the powers of the Scottish Parliament increase, and  the retention of some of its own taxes. The Scottish and Welsh people are  moving on, and so should we.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than doing a King Canute, our time in this Assembly would be better served promoting and  shaping new emerging relationships through the designated structures  outlined in the Good Friday Agreement, which would be to the mutual benefit of  all concerned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I do not like  to stand in this Chamber without saying the words &ldquo;stand up for Derry&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Lunn: On these occasions, I sometimes feel as though  we are intruding in a private squabble, and I wonder  whether some of my colleagues pay the slightest attention to anything  that goes on outside this House. Do they actually talk to anyone outside  Stormont? Do they speak to constituents, or, even better, non-political friends  and neighbours, or listen to the &lsquo;Steven Nolan Show&rsquo;, or &lsquo;Talkback&rsquo;? When I see  motions such as the one on the Order Paper,  I wonder whether some Members are living in a fantasy world.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The people to whom I talk want to see us get down to real  business, and they are fed up with seeing politicians engage in an endless  round of sectarian squabbling for the sake of a few seconds&rsquo; coverage on the  evening news. Instead, they would like to see us tackle issues such as the terrible  toll of road deaths in this country, or developing the type of economy that we  need to survive in a twenty-first century of brutal global competition, or the  fact that our inability to implement European environmental rules means that we  are still dumping raw sewage into the sea.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion will do absolutely nothing to make Northern Ireland a better society. It is  simply an attempt by the right wing of the Ulster Unionist Party to  outdo the DUP in the silly game of &ldquo;who leads unionism?&rdquo;. The motion will do  nothing except divide the House on an issue over which the Assembly has  absolutely no power &mdash; an issue to which no one outside Northern Ireland  will pay the slightest bit of notice.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a believer in free speech, I absolutely support the  Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s right to bring business to the Chamber. If it makes them look foolish, I should probably welcome  it, but I really wish we were spending our time talking about something useful.  I wonder whether they have even thought through the implications of the scheme  that they are proposing. Of the three devolved Governments in operation in the UK,  the one in Scotland is entirely nationalist, the one in Wales is half  nationalist, and, at the danger of stating the obvious, the one here is  also half nationalist.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I can just imagine the nature of the input from the  nationalist half of this Assembly if Mr Adams and his party found themselves  able to contribute to such a commission.  What do the proposers of the motion think that Alex Salmond or Ieuan Wyn  Jones would say to a Royal Commission? Do they think that a Royal Commission  would take evidence only from people with whom the UUP agrees?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The world has changed fundamentally over the past decade,  as indeed has the nature of both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.  The Ulster Unionist Party still seems to struggle with that reality,  and, with their amendment, the DUP seems to be determined to give themselves a  pat on the back, and then propose exactly  the same action. The SDLP amendment appears worthy, and does not say  anything that the Alliance Party would take major issue with, but given that  the thrust of the motion is to set up a Royal Commission to further promote the  unity of the United Kingdom,  what is the connection between the original motion and the SDLP amendment? It  does not even mention a Royal Commission.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  The Member appears to be in favour of the  SDLP amendment, and against the original motion from the Ulster Unionist  Party, and the DUP&rsquo;s amend&shy;ment. I thought that the Alliance Party supported  the principle of consent of the people of Northern   Ireland, who wish to remain part of the United Kingdom.  Is it now leaning towards becoming a nationalist party?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  thank the Member for his contribution. I did not realise that he had read the  rest of my speech.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is another  example of unionist insecurity to try to obtain yet another assurance  that is now being proposed by both unionist  parties. The second amendment seeks to emphasise the significant  expansion of the North/South dimension, but it does at least emphasise that the  principle of consent will determine the future status of Northern Ireland.  We are really at the point at which the SDLP can acknowledge that. However,  once again, the unionists display their lack of faith in the many confirmations  given by other interested bodies that their Britishness is secure &mdash; unless the  population votes otherwise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This debate is an example of how to waste valuable Assembly time that we can ill afford to lose. The  Alliance Party will oppose both of  the amendments and the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Simpson: It is  regrettable that Alex Attwood was cut  off in his prime. However, we should be grateful for small mercies when we receive them. Mr Savage &mdash;  one of the proposers of the motion &mdash; will be glad and will go home to Upper Bann saying that he is now a  right-winger. George will be dancing the whole road home.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome any debate that will forge greater links with the  United Kingdom.  Despite the comments from the Sinn F&eacute;in Members, they are living in a fantasy  world. However, only time will tell exactly what will take place.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP amendment incorporates all that is best in the  original motion, including the call for the establish&shy;ment of a Royal Commission. However, our amendment goes further than  the motion. It makes considerable improvements to the motion and takes greater  account of where the United    Kingdom is on political and constitutional  issues than the original UUP motion. The motion restricts its call for a Royal  Commission:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to review the steps that need to be taken to maintain  the unity of &hellip; the United    Kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP amendment goes  way beyond that admirable goal. It calls for the appointment of such a  Royal Commission:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to review the steps that need to be taken to promote  further the unity&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">of that United Kingdom. On that fact alone, the  amendment ought to command widespread support. I ask those Members who tabled  the motion to fall in behind the DUP amendment. Our amendment also refers to the commitments made in the draft  Programme for Government, and it is very plain as regards east-west relationships. The draft Programme for  Government refers to &ldquo;mutually  beneficial and practical co-operation&rdquo;. That is a good principle that  ensures that any arrange&shy;ment should be  beneficial to Northern    Ireland. However, it also takes account of our ongoing relationships  else&shy;where. I congratulate the Executive for committing themselves to benefiting the United Kingdom  as a whole.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our amendment takes greater account of where the UK currently  stands on political and constitutional issues than the Ulster Unionist Party  motion. Our amendment refers to Government proposals to develop a British  statement of values. Those proposals are designed to work with the British  public to develop a British statement of values that will set out the ideals  and principles that bind us together as a nation. Surely the DUP amendment gives far more expression to the hoped-for outcome of those who tabled the  motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that I have shown why amendment No 1 deserves support, and much of what I have said  exposes the fact that amendment No 2 completely ignores the idea that  any east-west relationship could be beneficial to Northern Ireland. Instead,  amendment No 2 is about outdated ideology. Only the SDLP can say why it wraps  itself in political notions that are well past their sell-by date.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that amendment No 1 is worthy of the support of  all people of goodwill in the Chamber, and I commend it to the House.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McElduff: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom labhairt in &eacute;adan an r&uacute;in agus i bhfabhar an  leasaithe.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  That sounds painfully like the Six Counties?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  The occupied Six Counties. I speak in opposition to the motion and in favour of  amend&shy;ment No 2, which was tabled by the SDLP.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The wording and substance of the motion bespeak a lack of  self confidence on the part of the proposers &mdash; why introduce them at all? Do  the proposers fear that the union with England is losing relevance in the  minds of people day by day, which is what I believe? It would explain the  defensive nature of the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In recent times, the  British Government has transferred significant  powers to the Assembly, the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament, and that has been universally  welcomed. Last March, the proposers even went to the electorate on a manifesto  platform of reducing West&shy;minster&rsquo;s  political powers in the North of Ireland and exercising greater local  responsibility. The Royal Commission seems  to be an anachronism &mdash; something that belongs to an imperialist notion  of history &mdash; and that is enough to be saying on that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A cursory reading of the UUP motion and the DUP amendment  makes it clear to whoever is interested that unionist internal party-political  rivalry is the main reason why today&rsquo;s debate has been tabled. It might even  explain the context for George Savage&rsquo;s unusual, untypical and intemperate  affirmation of no surrender &mdash; fair play to George, I am sure it will have  helped someone in his townland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One key flaw in the motion is the presumption that the  political union between the Six Counties and the island of Britain  is in the best interests of the people who live in the North of Ireland. Of  course, many people do not believe that to be the case, but rather that their  best interests lie in a future united Ireland of equals. The unionist  community might enjoy more clout in a new Ireland than they do as a small  minority in the so-called United    Kingdom. It is agreed that people have been  disadvantaged by the union &mdash; not least the farming community, to which the UK label has  never been of benefit in this, or any, part of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion ignores the North/South dimension, and Martina  Anderson covered that point adequately in her contribution.  In fact, the motion robs people in Scotland  and Wales of their right to national  self-determination by binding them  to something to which they may not consent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the recent past, I was one of four MLAs who attended the  British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in Oxford,   England.  Although it is wonderful that David Simpson says that he wants closer links  with the UK, I found that English MPs, and members of the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly, and the Channel  Islands&rsquo; and Isle of Man&rsquo;s legislatures cannot understand why the UUP and the DUP refuse to take up their  membership of that body.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What hope do they have of winning the day via a Royal  Commission, when they cannot work the mechanisms that already exist?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I wish to make a suggestion. There has been  much talk about the future constitutional position of the North and whether it  rests with the UK  or with a new Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement makes provision for a  referendum on our future constitutional status and for a border poll. I invite  the unionist parties to consider conducting a border poll, or a referendum on  our future constitutional status, because they might discover that the results  would challenge a whole lot of notions and assumptions. There is even a  possibility that the unionist majority in the Six Counties might remain in the  short term; but let us put that to the test. I look forward to a time &mdash; in the  not-too-distant future &mdash; when the people of Ireland will take their rightful  place among the nations of the world. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr O&rsquo;Loan: The motion is terrible. It is a pity that it  was proposed, because it will only do damage. The reaction of the parties is  predictable &mdash; all the unionist parties support the motion or the DUP amendment;  all the nationalist parties oppose it. Anyone watching from outside the House  could have scripted every speech in advance. The DUP needs to show that it is  more unionist than the Ulster Unionist Party, so it has proposed an amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Simpson: Change  your speech. Let us see whether your speech will make a difference.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr O&rsquo;Loan: It is hardly surprising that the House is  relatively empty this afternoon; that is appropriate for a debate that is a  fairly empty ritual.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What provoked the motion  and the DUP amendment? Was it, as one Member remarked, confidence in the  Union? Of course not. It was simply the  opposite; concern about the fragility of the Union  initiated the motion. It cannot be unconnected with the substantial interest in  independence for Scotland  that is being pursued by Mr Alex Salmond, who is a good friend of our First  Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What is wrong with the motion is that it represents the  politics of old. It is a statement that comes entirely from one side of the  community, pretending that the other side does not exist. It presents an  orthodox unionist view as if it were the whole truth. Nobody reading the motion  would think that we had forged, with the  greatest difficulty, a way of conducting politics that embraces the  whole community. That way of conducting politics achieved its summit in the  Good Friday Agreement. Despite  protestations to the contrary, that is essentially where we still stand.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>The agreement is  worth quoting from. The declar&shy;ation of support says that</strong>:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We are committed to partnership, equality and mutual  respect as the basis of relationships within Northern Ireland, between North and  South, and between these islands.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The thinking behind the agreement is simply light years  away from that of the proposers of the motion or the DUP amendment. The thinking behind the agreement is the only  way forward for Government here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to refer to a couple of instances of &ldquo;bad language&rdquo;  that I recently heard in the Assembly. First, Members may have noticed the  phrase &ldquo;four-party mandatory coalition&rdquo;, which was used by the Minister of  Finance and Personnel once or twice.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  Is that not right?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr O&rsquo;Loan: I will comment on it. Members might notice  in particular the use of the word &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo;. The coalition is not mandatory  at all. The DUP, or any party, could have walked away and lived with the  consequences of doing so. However, that is not the most important point. The  only way in which we can do business here is together.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If we are going to do business together, and do it well to  counter our very real social and economic problems, we cannot afford to do it  begrudgingly. We have a choice. We can talk ourselves down, or we can talk  ourselves up. In talking about working together as being &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; we are  talking ourselves down. We must embrace the common project &mdash; not damage it by  careless use of language that causes real damage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The other piece of language that I want to refer to happens  quite often, but this struck me particularly just yesterday: the Minister of  Health, Mr McGimpsey, was talking about  cancer treatment, and he referred to creating the best facilities in the  north-west, making much out of comparisons with the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">He then said that he would co-operate with the health  system in the South. At first glance that may sound  generous, and, as a unionist Minister, he probably thinks that it is.  However, that policy is woefully inadequate when dealing with healthcare; and  that point extrapolates to other policy areas.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Who seriously thinks that, with a population of 1&middot;7  million, we can do everything efficiently and in a world-class manner by  ourselves? Co-operation is not adequate, and it is not the right and necessary  language to be using. We need to free ourselves and organise our structures on  a North-South basis when it makes sense to do so, as it often will, and on a  British-Irish basis when it makes sense to do that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP amendment is a model of common sense and fairness.  That is why, in all probability, Members of this Assembly will reject it, or  certainly will attempt to do so. If there was real political maturity in this  Assembly or this society, the proposers of the motion would withdraw it, and  the amendments would fall. However, I fear that I ask for too much.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: In a spirit of reconciliation and  atonement for my earlier mistake in cutting off the proposers of the two  amendments, I have decided that those summing up the two amendments can have a  little extra time to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr A Maginness: I agree with my colleague Mr O&rsquo;Loan  that the stated positions of all of the parties were predictable, and conformed  to what one may have expected.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a result of the Good Friday Agreement &mdash; which all  Members are now committed to, either directly or indirectly, officially or  unofficially &mdash; the principle of consent is  central to the constitutional position. Therefore, to use the words of  Dermot Ahern, the constitutional position has been parked. That is a sensible  decision.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As my colleague Alex Attwood said in his speech, we now  have a new type and period of politics. The implementation of the Good Friday  Agreement &mdash; or Belfast Agreement, as some people prefer to call it &mdash; means that  there is now a partnership arrangement in Northern Ireland, between North and  South, and also between Ireland and Britain. The SDLP amendment simply reflects  the realities of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To some extent, I am disappointed with colleagues in the  Ulster Unionist Party who have tabled a motion that, if it is not contrary to  the Good Friday Agreement, is certainly contrary to the spirit of that  Agreement. What we are trying to build &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span><span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I know that George Savage disagrees with me, and I have  every respect for him and his unionist opinions. Nonetheless, as a result of  the Good Friday Agreement, we are now into  new politics, which have led to partner&shy;ship and will, I hope, ultimately lead to reconciliation in this society. I do not know, and no one can  predict, where that will lead to. It could lead to a realignment of politics,  not just in Ireland,  but throughout these islands.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One should also remember that we are members of the  European Union, which as a dynamic institution, has done much to reduce the  tensions and the ancient and historic hostilities between Ireland and Britain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The relationship between the Republic and Britain has never been better &mdash; it is much  better than the relationship between Northern   Ireland and Britain. That is something that  unionists should examine.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We respect unionists&rsquo; point of view; we respect unionism;  we respect their right to feel proud of being unionists and to have an  association with Britain.  However, Northern Ireland is  in an era of new politics, so let us work to create partnership and bonds  between people in Northern Ireland,  between North and South and between Britain  and Ireland.  We do not exclude the east-west relationship. Although we consider the  North/South relationship to be extremely important, we do not seek to diminish  that other relationship.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that Barry McElduff and Martina Anderson  expressed support for the SDLP amendment and  that the Alliance Party recognised its merits, although I am disappointed that its Members will not be  supporting it. If that party sees value in the amendment and considers  it sensible and consistent with the agreement, it should support it rather than  opt out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The speeches of Mr Simpson and Mr Hamilton were predictably  nationalistic &mdash; British nationalistic &mdash; <strong>and  there is nothing wrong with that. However, those Members miss the centrality of  our new politics</strong>: to build relationships  in our society, in the Assembly, in the Executive and between North and  South. Emphasising such nationalism does injury to the objectives of the Good  Friday Agreement: bringing about peace and reconciliation and harmony among all  our people. Everyone recognises the great  value of those objectives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Extensive devolution in Britain has created new political relationships between the Scottish, the  English and the Welsh. More power has been ceded to the National  Assembly for Wales,  and yet greater power will be given to it in the near future. The Welsh, the Scots  &mdash; and, perhaps as a reaction to that, the English &mdash; are less interested in the  unitary system that has existed in Britain for the past couple of centuries.  Where the process will end no one knows; but those natural and important  relationships are developing, and it is important for us in Northern Ireland  to recognise them. By failing to do so, we are burying our heads in the sand.  The peoples on the island   of Britain are developing  a new form of political relationship and a new form of constitution, and  Members ought to recognise that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I urge all Members to support amendment No 2, which is both  reasonable and fair.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I have listened intently to Members&rsquo; contributions. Sometimes, I am amazed at  the position that certain people adopt in debates. Often, the phrase that we in  Northern Ireland  have &ldquo;moved on&rdquo; is used, inside and outside  this House. That is correct: people have moved on. When are the  politicians going to move on?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In fairness to Alban  Maginness, he made a very strong case  in support of the SDLP amendment. I would prefer it if he were to  support the DUP amendment, because he has said some things with which I agree.  He said that we have developed an arrangement in Northern Ireland that seems to be  working, which is correct.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Surely, if we are going to develop a strategy and a way  forward, we must do so on the basis of deciding where we are? Simply put, we  are rooted in the United    Kingdom. Barry McElduff may have a problem  getting his head around that concept.  However, the real problem for the Shinners is that they must try to live  with and justify &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Lord Morrow: You have tried to free Ireland &mdash; as  you call it &mdash; with the gun for over 35 years, and you have not done it yet. You  will find that even the people that you claim to represent are quite happy and  content to live in this part of the United Kingdom.  You have tried to make unionists  feel that our cause was not legitimate, proper and correct. At least now  we have an acknow&shy;ledgement from the SDLP that there is nothing wrong with  being a unionist, and that, indeed, one may be very proud to be a unionist.  Therefore, we must be grateful for the small mercies that fall from these great  tables from time to time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan takes great exception to the repeated references  that were made to the four-party mandatory coalition in the House on Tuesday of  last week. One can turn that one around and  twist it over as many ways as one likes, but the fact remains that it is  a mandatory coalition, and a four-party mandatory coalition. I see the SDLP shaking their heads &mdash; perhaps I can  persuade them to shake them the other way. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As unionists, we acknowledge that the only way in which we  will achieve change is to move forward together. That is the reason for there  being a mandatory coalition at the moment.  That is not the best or the most satisfactory arrangement in the world,  and I suspect that it may not even endure &mdash; but what do we want to do? We want  to put something in place that will endure in the weeks, months and years that  lie ahead.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is not to say that the DUP will not be respectful of  others who hold different opinions. We accept that there is a divide in Northern Ireland, but at least we have a  Government in place that appear to have the popular support of the people of Northern Ireland.  I wonder whether we can move forward from  that position.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not often agree with Barry McElduff, but I ask the  SDLP to withdraw its amendment, because it now acknowledges that we have a  right to exist within the Union, and it says  that it is not going to try to take that away from us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Barry McElduff said of the Ulster Unionists that the  motion&rsquo;s wording and substance bespoke a lack of self confidence on the part of  the proposers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For once, Barry, you are right.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, I ask the Lord Morrow to refer all his remarks through the  Chair. I have given you some latitude until now, but please direct your remarks  through the Chair.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>: I cannot think of a better way to do it, Mr Deputy Speaker.  Thank you very much. I apologise for my not being up to the mark again.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That lack of confidence is why the DUP has tabled its amendment. Having considered the motion, my  party says sincerely to the Ulster Unionists that it shows a lack of  confidence. My party does not lack confidence in  the way forward &mdash; absolutely not. The DUP believes that the Union is secure. Even the Taoiseach says that the constitutional position of Northern Ireland  is settled for the long term.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McElduff: A  LeasCheann Comhairle, why, then, does  the DUP not take up its membership of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body? That is a  straightforward question. Why did the DUP not take up its place at the  body&rsquo;s thirty-fifth conference in plenary format that was held in Oxford a week ago? Might  the DUP decide to take up its places on the  body by the time the plenary in Wexford takes place in April 2008?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Lord Morrow: Mr McElduff will be aware that the  British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body of which he speaks was a product of the  Anglo-Irish Agreement, which was foisted over the heads of unionists. Does he  recall that agreement? It is the reason that my party does not take up its  places on that body. I hope that the Member will rest content.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The four parts of the  United Kingdom were mentioned, as  too was the danger that, under devolution, the United Kingdom will split  up &mdash; and that Alex Salmond is one of the people who must be watched. I want to  draw Members&rsquo; attention to certain comments that Alex Salmond has made. In  fairness to him, he is committed to restoring the ferry service between  Ballycastle and Campbeltown. One might say  that that is not a big deal. However, it is a big deal in that it shows  that there is an affinity between Scotland  and Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, the same Mr Salmond exclaimed that Scotland was  free in 1993, and a separatist heaven in 2007. 1993 is long gone, and Scotland is still an integral part of the United Kingdom.  2007 is almost gone, and the utopia that Mr Salmond referred to has not  arrived. Unless he gets his skates on within the next two or three weeks, it will not arrive in time. I know  that much, folks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I implore the Ulster Unionists to unite with the DUP on  this matter. After such a reasonable and rational debate, I ask you, Mr  Maginness, to withdraw the SDLP amendment and accept the status quo.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: It may have been a senior moment,  Lord Morrow, but you did not address your last remarks through the Chair.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Lord Morrow: I apologise, Mr Deputy Speaker. Do I still  have the Floor?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: Yes, for 10 seconds.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>: I will, therefore, apologise once more for my not being up to  the mark. Again, I make an emphatic plea to the SDLP, which tabled the other  amendment to the motion: now is the time for the House to unite steadfastly behind  the DUP amendment in support of the United Kingdom. I suspect that Mr McElduff will not even bother to vote against my  party&rsquo;s amendment because he is aware  that the cause for which his party fought for the past 40 years is a  lost one.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Burnside: I thank all Members, with one exception,  for their contributions to the debate, which has taken place in a good mannered  and courteous atmosphere. It would be a bad state of affairs if at Stormont &mdash;  or in the D&aacute;il, Scotland, Wales or the sovereign Parliament at Westminster &mdash;  democratically elected Members could not call for a debate or find the time to  discuss the relationships in these islands among the devolved assemblies of the  United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The most intemperate remarks &mdash;  which always seem to come from moderates &mdash; came from a friendly Alliance  Member, who said that the debate was a waste of time. I do not regard it as a  waste of time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Without going into too much detail, I wish to comment on  the two amendments. There is some reasonableness in the SDLP amendment, which  recognises the principle of consent. The SDLP is a constitutional nationalist  party that has recognised the principle of consent throughout its history. My  party welcomes that. However, I object to the SDLP amendment because it  concentrates too much on all-Ireland relationships.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We already have all-Ireland relationships, yet the SDLP now  wants more of them. We have never had so many all-Ireland institutions that the  Ulster Unionist Party supports and that the DUP completely supports, including  two new all-Ireland institutions that were set up as a result of the St Andrews  Agreement. Therefore, there are lots of institutions. On many occasions, those  institutions are set up to appease nationalism&rsquo;s philo&shy;sophical and political  objectives rather than to aid real economic co-operation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unionists in the House  will oppose the SDLP amend&shy;ment, because it is too narrow and seeks to  increase the number of North/South bodies rather than to increase relationships  across these islands. The Ulster Unionist Party is more than happy to accept  amendment No 1, which Democratic Unionist Party MLAs tabled. Their proposed  amendment supports the main thrust of our motion  to set up a Royal Commission, something which the SDLP amendment  opposes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party tabled the motion because to have consent from the regions of the United Kingdom  is not enough. I remember when consent for  maintaining the Union was not enough.  Devolution was ill-thought out and badly timed. Different systems were used for  Scotland and Wales, and different systems, techniques and  procedures were used for Northern    Ireland. Obviously, Northern Ireland  had a violent rebellion going on for 35 years that turned the whole peace  process into a political process. Things have changed on the mainland. Some of  those changes have been good for the Union and  some have been bad for it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I remember when, 15 or 20 years ago, the Labour Party &mdash; the  current party of Government &mdash; was advocating the withdrawal of troops from Northern Ireland.  It is to be greatly welcomed, and it helps the confidence of the unionist  people throughout the whole of the kingdom, that the Labour Party now  recognises the principle of consent. Its old attitude on withdrawal from Northern Ireland has been replaced, and that has  undermined the militant republican, Sinn F&eacute;in/IRA position of withdrawing the  British presence from Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Conservative Party is changing, too. In some ways, I do  not like the way in which that party is changing. However, it is evolving.  Undoubtedly, the English Conservative Party is applying pressure, because it  seeks the magic number of 255 Members in the British House of Commons. That is  what it is after. It is not showing as much interest in Scotland, Wales or  Northern Ireland, which account for one seat, three seats and no seats,  respectively, at Westminster. The Conservative Party is looking for a majority  in the Commons. Internally, it is considering and debating whether England should  have its own Parliament, be it in the form of a Grand Committee of the House of  Commons or some other form. However, it is certainly considering the idea of England having  its own Parliament. If that were to happen, Northern   Ireland&rsquo;s MPs, Scotland&rsquo;s  MPs and Wales&rsquo;s  MPs would not vote on internal  English matters. Therefore, changes are taking place in the Conservative  Party that are changing and affecting the relationships between the three  devolved institutions &mdash; one Parliament, two Assemblies &mdash; and the national Parliament  and Government at Westminster.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Liberal Democrats,  who are a bit like the Alliance Party in that they cannot make up their  minds about anything, have their views as well. They accept the principle of  consent and that the United Kingdom  will remain as long as its consenting parts  &mdash; Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland &mdash; wish to remain  part of it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A Royal Commission,  within tight terms of reference, is  a constructive way in which to have a sensible debate on the future  relationship between the two Assemblies, the  one devolved Parliament in Scotland  and the national Parliament.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Changes are also happening externally, to which our SDLP friend Alban Maginness has referred. The  relation&shy;ship between the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Government and the  European Government is on the agenda again. Whether one calls it a constitution  or a treaty rather depends on whether one comes from the centre, is a  Euro-sceptic or is on the pro-European side of the debate. Great constitutional  changes are continuing to evolve in the United   Kingdom, in the relationship between the UK and the European Union, and in our  relationships with friends and neighbours, such as the Republic of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nationalism in England,  Scotland and Wales poses a major threat to the Union. I like Alex Salmond and get on well with him. He was a great operator in Westminster at a time when I was in that House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">He is a dangerous, Machiavellian man. When Mr Salmond came here at the invitation of the First <strong>Minister,</strong><strong> I said to him</strong>: &ldquo;You are the most Machiavellian man I have ever  met.&rdquo; He said to me, &ldquo;David, Machiavelli was not nearly Machiavellian enough  for me.&rdquo; He is trying to create the circumstances in Scotland  that will get the English to end the Union. There are two sides to the Union, and my greatest fear is that circumstances may  arise that will threaten it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I find very worrying some of the comments that the First Minister, as a unionist and as leader of the Assembly, made about Alex Salmond&rsquo;s policies.  Supporting Alex Salmond&rsquo;s call for a Queen of Scotland would end the unity of the United Kingdom that was established  by the Act of Union in 1707. There would no longer be a Queen of the United  Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. We do not need another Mary  Queen of Scots; we need a continuation of one Crown for the whole of the United  Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I have concerns about the views  that our First Minister expressed, although I wish him all the best in his  campaign in the United States  to bring investment to Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must continue to examine whether, under the principle of  consent, there are constructive and democratic ways to develop the  institutional relationships between the devolved Parliament and Assemblies of  the United Kingdom  and the national Government. That relationship is under strain. If there was an  economic recession across the entire United   Kingdom, increasing English nationalism would put  pressure on Scotland.  The English would say, &ldquo;Go away, Scotland;  take your North Sea oil and have your own Parliament and your Queen of Scotland.&rdquo; Northern    Ireland would not escape the effects of that sentiment. Our Members of Parliament  who have devolved powers in Northern Ireland  would not be treated differently from other Members of Parliament in the United Kingdom.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore the Ulster Unionist Party recommends that there  should be a Royal Commission, with tight terms of references, under the  leadership of Gordon Brown. Now is the time  to establish a Royal Commission because Gordon Brown is playing the  pro-Union card of Britishness &mdash; even though he and his colleagues have  ludicrous ideas about putting a dragon on the Union flag. However, they are  considering the issue of nationality. For Gordon Brown to continue to be Prime  Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland he must be  a unionist. It would be inconceivable for a British Prime Minister who comes from Scotland not to vote on most of the  legislation that passes through our  national Parliament and Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want the pro-Union card  played as often as possible in the interests of English and mainland  politicians. Ulster  unionists on this side of the Irish Sea should strengthen the relationship  between Stormont, Scotland  and Wales and the national  sovereign Government at Westminster,  and the best way to do that is by establishing a Royal Commission. I ask for as  much support as possible for the motion. The Ulster Unionist Party will support  amendment No 1, which strengthens our motion. In the cause of unionist unity &mdash;</p>

	      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Assembly do now adjourn. &mdash; <em>[Mr Deputy Speaker]</em></p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="6"></a>Adjournment</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Provision of Traffic Attendants in &nbsp;Waterfoot, Cushendall and Cushendun</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the proposer of the debate will have 10  minutes to speak.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank Members for their attendance, and I  thank the Minister for Regional Development, who has responsibility for the provision of traffic attendants, for  his presence. I am grateful for the opportunity to debate the matter of traffic attendants in the north Antrim villages  of Waterfoot, Cushendall and Cushendun.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will give a bit of background on the three villages. I  know that they are well known and well loved by many Members. Waterfoot,  Cushendall and Cushendun are traditionally Irish in character with attractive  vernacular-type buildings and narrow streets. The villages are situated in the  glens of Antrim and along the Causeway coastal route, which runs from Belfast right through to Derry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In July we saw the installation of nearly 400 signs along  the Causeway coastal route, signed off &mdash; if <strong>Members will excuse the pun &mdash; by the Minister responsible for tourism,  Nigel Dodds, who said</strong>:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Causeway    Coastal Route is one of the key driving routes in Northern Ireland and the new signage will  encourage visitors to experience and enjoy  all of the scenic attractions within the Causeway Coast and Glens region. The route will lead visitors to inland scenic areas,  bringing increased visitor number and tourism revenue to a wider geographical  area.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">My point here is to outline the importance of the  main road through the three villages of  Waterfoot, Cushendall and Cushendun.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 30 October 2006, there was a transfer of enforcement  powers from the police for most parking restrictions, including yellow lines,  urban clearways, bus lanes, limited-waiting parking places and pay-and-display  bays. NCP Ltd was appointed to carry out that enforcement on behalf of Roads  Service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In July 2007, I asked the Minister for Regional Development  to provide details of traffic-attendant patrols in the Moyle District Council  area since the implementation of the new traffic-management scheme. The  Minister responded that, from October 2006 to the end of June 2007, there had  been 62 patrols in the Ballycastle area, six in the Bushmills area and three at  the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway. There was no mention of  any patrols in the rest of the Moyle District Council area, including in the  villages of Waterfoot, Cushendall and Cushendun.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Causeway coastal route runs through those three  villages; hey are at the heart of the master plan for the Causeway   Coast and glens area, and  they regularly face total gridlock. Cars are parked on both sides of the  street, drivers ignore yellow lines,  lorries are abandoned outside local  businesses while goods are delivered,  and, daily, coaches attempt to manoeuvre around tight corners.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The traffic problem is not just a seasonal one. In  February, a colleague met two Roads Service staff in the centre of Cushendall  to discuss an unrelated issue. In the space of about 30 minutes, they saw five  large coaches travelling through the village. The Roads Service employees saw  for themselves how difficult it is to drive through the village, because people  are able to abandon their vehicles wherever they like in the knowledge that there  is no enforcement in the area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In March, at a meeting of Moyle District Council&rsquo;s retail  and environmental working group, the same colleague  raised the issue of the lack of traffic attendants in the area with  Roads Service employees, and was told that the Roads Service would monitor  traffic over Easter and that, over the summer, due to the influx of tourist  traffic, traffic attendants would specifically staff the Causeway coastal  route. That did not happen.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>The Roads Service  website states that the objective of the new enforcement scheme is</strong>:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to reduce the number of illegally parked vehicles on  our roads. This in turn will reduce traffic congestion, improve road safety and  improve accessibility for all road-users,  including Blue Badges holders.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Significantly, the website also states that one of the  positive changes to the scheme is:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Helping traffic to flow more freely&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Elsewhere, the decriminalisation of parking enforce&shy;ment  may well be a success; however, it does not serve rural villages such as Waterfoot,  Cushendall and Cushendun. If traffic and parking is not managed in those three  villages, people will begin to avoid the area,  local businesses will suffer and the full benefit that the Causeway  coastal route brings to increased visitor numbers and tourist revenues in the  area will be lost.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister should urgently review the provision of  traffic attendants in the mid-glens area and in other rural villages. He should  do as his Department says in its  information leaflet on the decriminalisation of parking enforcement, and  get tough on illegal parking. Of course,  such enforcement must be discreet; however, it must happen.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Storey: The implementation of the  traffic-decriminalisation legislation makes it abundantly clear that the people  with responsibility for implementing enforcement priorities are not impartial.  Answers to recent questions about the number of tickets that have been issued  in towns such as Ballycastle reinforce the comments of Member for North Antrim  Mr O&rsquo;Loan.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Towns such as Cushendall and Waterfoot are being neglected. I am gravely concerned that the  consequences of the decriminalisation legislation are the driving  motivation of revenue generation, rather than traffic management. I thank Mr  O&rsquo;Loan for bringing the issue to the attention of the Assembly and,  particularly, of the Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Legislation must be well enforced; nevertheless we must  ensure that consideration of each area&rsquo;s traffic needs &mdash; not only the needs of  Cushendun, Cushendall and Waterfoot, but  those of areas across Northern    Ireland &mdash; is paramount. Traffic  management is not just about issuing tickets in order to reach a monthly quota,  and to ensure that the company with the  contract is satisfied that a good return has been made on its  investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I thank the Member for bringing the Causeway  coastal route to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The North Antrim  constituency has the coastal route, and we can say with some pride that it is  of idyllic beauty. We are very proud of it, and we want to encourage people to  visit it all year round. If visitors are hindered when they come into the  villages, such as Cushendall or Waterfoot, which are mentioned in Mr O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s  proposal for the Adjournment debate, surely they will sail on through or bypass  them. We must adopt a pragmatic approach to traffic control, which requires  sensible enforcement.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also wish to talk about the input of the PSNI. The rural  community suffers not only from the lack of enforcement  of traffic management, but from a lack of a PSNI presence. At weekends, the part of my constituency from  Cushendall to Bushmills is neglected, and there is only what might be called a  skeleton staff on duty. One weekend, there were only three police officers on  duty in the Ballycastle station to cover the whole area. That is totally  unacceptable, and I have raised the matter with the district commander.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Mr O&rsquo;Loan for bringing the matter to the Minister&rsquo;s  attention, and I welcome the fact that the Minister is here. I trust that he  will bear in mind the genuine concerns of people who want to enhance the lives  not only of those who pass through the area, but of those who live in the rural  villages. We must ensure that they can go about their business unimpeded, and I  trust that consideration will be given to the points that have been raised.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I too thank the Member for bringing  the issue of traffic management in the glens to the House. When I speak of the  glens, I refer to the glens ward, which includes Armoy, a village that  sometimes is forgotten when it comes to issues such as tourism. As far as I am  aware, however, it does not face any great problems with parking and traffic.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise the need for adequate enforcement, but it requires a multifaceted approach. We must  ensure that appropriate parking facilities are available throughout the  glens and that the public make use of them. There is an excellent car park in  Waterfoot, which is filled to the brim in  the summer. The recent provision of lighting there has allayed some concerns about security. However, the  pedestrian access to and from the car park is not safe, and that must be  greatly improved before it can be offered as a viable alternative to the  public.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not aware of any yellow lines or parking restrictions  in Cushendun, but I am well aware of the problems  that Waterfoot and Cushendall face, especially during the summer and  when community festivals are held in the area. I know that Roads Service has already  agreed to give priority to a request from the local council for more resources  to be used at weekends during the summer months.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is very little room for manoeuvre for drivers on Waterfoot&rsquo;s main street. However, most of the  vehicles parked there &mdash; especially  at this time of year &mdash; belong to people using the local shops and  businesses. I am aware that the provision of lay-bys along the main street is  being explored. That scheme may help to improve the situation, although it will  depend on the views of the householders who live there.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another issue is the livestock market that is held in the  middle of Cushendall, which adds to the traffic problems. Planning Service and  other agencies should support any efforts to establish the market outside the  village, which could help to alleviate congestion. An increase in the provision  of traffic wardens will not solve the traffic and parking problems in the area.  Traffic-management schemes, the provision of more car parking places and  meaningful consultation with local residents will help to address the problems.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of providing  parking bays for disabled drivers in the villages in the glens, especially in  close proximity to essential services, such as post offices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Better public parking facilities throughout the glens of  Antrim are required, and the possible provision of car-parking permits for  local residents should also be explored. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I thank Mr O&rsquo;Loan for bringing this issue to the attention of the  House and for giving us the opportunity to air these important points in the  presence of the Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are three areas that should be considered. First,  there is tourism. As representatives for North Antrim, we are doing our level best to encourage tourists to visit  that beautiful area. It is almost impossible, especially during the summer, for  traffic to get through some of the villages that have been mentioned.  Considering the coaches that are now being used, and the number of people who  arrive to see the beauty of that lovely route along the coast, it is important  to take this issue seriously and to ensure that there is a free flow of traffic through those villages during the  summer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members have mentioned, it is not simply a question of  traffic management; it is important to provide areas in which people can park  their cars. If we are to increase tourism, this issue must be taken seriously,  progressed and examined in its entirety to ensure that those who are breaking  the traffic laws are brought to book.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the economics of the area must be considered.  People who drive along that route to see the beauty of the road may wish to  stop for a meal at one of the hotels. However, because of the traffic problems  and congestion, they may turn off to the left to find somewhere else where they  can enjoy their meal without worrying about the traffic.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been mentioned,  in connection with the economic issue, that people who own shops and  businesses, and especially the farming community &mdash; who come to the area for the  market and to exchange their goods &mdash; must  also be considered. How on earth are those people supposed to conduct  their business if illegal parking on both sides of the road is allowed to  continue?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, this problem should not be considered only from  the point of view of the three villages to which reference has been made. The issue needs to be addressed with  reference to the road from Belfast  right through to Ballycastle. When that is taken into account, it will be seen  in the context of something far greater.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the Minister is present, and I ask him to  take on board the fact that regulations have been put in place but that no  follow-up action has been taken, which has led to the continuation of old bad  habits. I am sure that if the issue is taken seriously, those habits will  eventually be broken, because when people are hit in their pockets, they are  hit in the most tender part.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Again, I thank Mr O&rsquo;Loan for bringing this issue to the  attention of the House.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  also thank Declan O&rsquo;Loan for raising the issue, which concerns an area that I  know well. I remember, way back in my single days, spending many weekends in  Cushendun and enjoying nothing more than canoeing on the River Dun and out in  the bay. Therefore, it is an area that I not only got to know very well but  that I grew to love very much.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that there are major problems,  particularly during the summer. The issue that stands out more than any other  is the lack of public-parking facilities in the three villages.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a car park in Waterfoot and another in Cushendun,  but Cushendall lacks adequate parking provision. We live at a time when we want  to increase tourism not only in Northern    Ireland as a whole but in the glens of Antrim in particular. It is the most  beautiful part of the island   of Ireland. The road to  Torr Head is much more spectacular than the Ring of Kerry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The area has a lot going for it, and it is important that  we make it more amenable for those who want to come for a holiday and stay in  the places concerned. Adjacent to Cushendun lies Knocknacarry, where there is  also very limited parking.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the Minister will address the problem, but rather than take a heavy-handed approach, we  should be sensible about the whole thing.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  I thank Declan O&rsquo;Loan, the Member who tabled the debate, and all Members who  have contributed to it. I welcome the  opportunity to discuss parking enforcement and general parking issues  along the Antrim coast &mdash; a very beautiful  part of the countryside &mdash; and, in particular, in Waterfoot, Cushendall  and Cushendun.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will try to address most the points raised in the debate,  but, as Ministers generally do in these debates, I have asked my officials to  study the Hansard report and I will respond in writing to Members about local  or specific issues raised.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">By way of background for Members who may not be familiar  with the subject, I would like to explain my Department&rsquo;s  involvement in the enforcement of on-street parking restrictions. On 30 October 2006, certain parking  restrictions were decriminalised, and my Department assumed responsibility for  their enforcement. Roads Service entered into a contract with NCP Services Ltd  to deploy traffic attendants to perform that service on its behalf. Prior to  decriminalisation, responsibility for enforcement rested with the PSNI, through  its traffic warden service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On average, 100 traffic attendants are deployed, from  Monday to Saturday, in larger towns and cities. They are mainly deployed on  foot. However, in some instances, they use bicycles and scooters to patrol  certain routes, such as clearways and bus lanes. In certain locations,  attendants are deployed on Sundays. In addition, 16 mobile attendants are  deployed in cars: their responsibilities are to provide support to on-foot  attendants at certain times and to cover smaller towns and villages as needed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I take this opportunity to dispel any myths about the contract  between my Department and NCP Services Ltd. Mervyn Storey, in particular,  referred to those arrangements. NCP Services Ltd is not paid according to the number of tickets issued, and individual  attendants are not set ticket quotas that they must meet. NCP Services  Ltd is paid a standard rate for the number of hours each attendant is deployed,  irrespective of the number of tickets issued. Revenue generated by the payment  of penalty charge notices, along with income from car parking and other charges,  supplements the overall financing of Roads Services by central Govern&shy;ment &mdash; it  does not go to NCP Services Ltd.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The objective of on-street enforcement is to reduce the  level of illegally parked vehicles, which helps to reduce congestion, improve  road safety and facilitates easier parking for blue badge holders and delivery  vehicles. To ensure that maximum benefit is derived from on-street parking  enforcement, Roads Service deploys attendants to areas where traffic volumes  are highest, and where illegal parking  causes most disruption. Targeting  available resources to areas of highest priority is key to the success  of the enforcement project.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn, a LeasCheann Comhairle, to Waterfoot,  Cushendall and Cushedun. As my colleague Daith&iacute; McKay pointed out, Cushendun has no waiting restrictions and,  therefore, there is no requirement to deploy traffic attendants in that area.  However, Waterfoot and Cushendall have a small number of restrictions in place:  there are 75 restricted metres in Waterfoot and 227 restricted metres in  Cushendall. That must be compared with 800,000 restricted metres across the  North.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When initial deployment  routes for the mobile patrols were established, no illegal parking  problems were identified in those villages. As a result, they have not been  included in routine mobile patrols. As a result of Mr O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s query, Roads  Service re-examined the Waterfoot and  Cushendall areas. During those assessments no illegal parking problems  were observed and no penalty charge notices issued. I have been advised by the  parking enforcement unit that it intends to keep the situation under review,  and that it intends to deploy mobile  patrols in those areas, particularly next summer.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that Mr O&rsquo;Loan supports the need for effective parking enforcement, and he has made  positive contributions to the related debate. I know that he is aware of  the benefits that it can bring, and I welcome his support. The Department&rsquo;s  objective is to ensure that people park  properly and legally, in order to reduce congestion and improve road safety in towns and  cities across the North. In that regard, the preliminary findings from  compliance surveys are encouraging; they show a significant reduction in the  number of illegally parked vehicles since the decriminalisation of parking  enforcement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that I have  addressed all the concerns. A general issue  was raised around parking facilities in the villages on the Antrim coast.  Roads Service is happy to work with elected representatives, and other  interested groups and individuals from those areas, to see where parking  facilities can be enhanced and improved. That was referred to by Daith&iacute; McKay,  Rev Coulter and Sean Neeson.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Following discussions  with local representatives about traffic management measures in  Waterfoot, a number of options have been established for the provision of  lay-bys on Main Street.  Those measures will help to reduce parking on the carriageway, and thereby  assist through traffic and help to relieve congestion. Roads Service is in a  design process for that scheme, which will be discussed with local  representatives and frontagers to seek  their opinion. Subject to the outcome of that discussion, it is hoped that  the scheme may commence during the present financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members made references  to other areas where parking facilities could be improved. I will be  happy to study the Hansard report and, if necessary, I will meet local  represent&shy;atives to see how those issues may be developed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, a LeasCheann Comhairle, I hope that I have  addressed all the concerns and points raised by  Members. As I said at the start, I have asked officials to take note of  the Hansard report; if I have missed any points that Members have raised, I  will write to them with clarification. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
