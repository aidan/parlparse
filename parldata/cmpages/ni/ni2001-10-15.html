                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What was the result of the lodging of those
                resignation letters by Dr Paisley and his party members? Have
                you acted on his desire that they should take effect
                immediately?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I understand it, Dr Paisley set out the
                situation clearly, and the position is as he stated it. There is
                nothing further that I should add to that.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are we to understand, Mr Speaker, that he was
                tendering his resignation and those of the relevant Members of
                his party from the Executive? There has been no public
                confirmation that that has occurred.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is somewhat confused. First, Dr
                Paisley could hardly have been tendering his resignation from
                the Executive since, for all his distinction, Dr Paisley is not
                a member of the Executive. He made it clear that, in the context
                of resignations by others, the resignation of his party’s
                Members would take effect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not the first time on which the
                matter has arisen. Similar letters were previously provided. I
                take it that Dr Paisley wanted it to be clear beyond
                peradventure that, should other events take place, we will
                proceed.</p>

                therefore, to what degree it involves me — and the extent to
                which it refers to the ministerial code, which is an Executive

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Social Security Fraud Bill is an integral
                part of the overall strategy of modernising the social security
                system to ensure that the right money goes to the right people
                at the right time. The Bill is designed to improve the way in
                which fraud is detected and to deter potential fraudsters.
                Members across the Assembly have endorsed my desire to tackle
                fraud. The Committee for Social Development passed the Bill
                unanimously. No amendment has been put forward during the
                passage of the Bill, because Members are aware that I am
                required by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to work with the
                Secretary of State to secure single systems of social security,
                child support and pensions for the United Kingdom. The Bill
                maintains parity with Great Britain on social security matters.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Members that the matter is the
                suspension of Standing Orders so that the Final Stage of the
                Social Security Fraud Bill may be taken today. I shall not
                accept speeches on the subject of the Bill, only on procedural
                matters. I have had no requests to speak. If the motion is
                agreed, we shall proceed immediately to the Final Stage. If the
                motion falls, the Final Stage of the Bill, which is on the Order
                Paper, also falls and will be taken at a subsequent time.
                Suspension of Standing Order 40(1) requires cross-community
                support. If there are Ayes on all sides of the House and no Noes,
                I shall consider that to be cross-community support.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a short, but important, Bill. Members
                are concerned about fraud. The estimated £73 million per annum
                of public money that is lost due to benefit fraud must be
                reduced. I shall not go over the provisions of the Bill in
                detail. However, it will help to reduce that loss, first,
                through prevention and early detection, using new
                information-gathering powers, and secondly, by deterrence, using
                the powers to restrict payments to persistent offenders and the
                swift and effective punishment of collusive employers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill represents a measured response to
                the problem of benefit fraud. I do not suggest that it will
                eliminate all such fraud. However, it is a reasonable response
                to the problems that we face, and it will close some of the more
                obvious loopholes that have come to light in recent years.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On average, each worker in the Northern
                Ireland economy has a significantly lower output than his or her
                equivalent in Great Britain, in much of the rest of the European
                Union, or in the United States. Unless those levels of
                productivity can be raised, it is doubtful whether we will be
                able to keep unemployment levels low or generate the resources
                from which money for necessary social spending, such as on
                education or health, can be raised.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Member consider the fact that bad
                management is the reason that productivity is low or not as good
                as in other places?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Member, and he will see that
                such issues are addressed in the report. Training, research and
                development can make a massive contribution to the achievement
                of higher productivity and, to reflect Mr Ervine’s
                intervention, that includes management training. Many columnists
                have argued that the skills of the labour force together with
                spending on associated research and development are the factors
                that result in any one region or country having a higher rate of
                economic growth than another. Education and training can
                contribute strongly to making unemployment, poverty and social
                exclusion less likely. There are strong grounds for regarding
                training for industry and its associated research and
                development as one of the most important challenges faced by the
                Assembly and the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are not, however, arguing that the only
                value of education is its contribution to the economy. In early
                2000, the Committee decided to initiate an inquiry into the
                contribution of the education system to industry and the
                research and development base in the universities. We have now
                completed that inquiry and are grateful to all who contributed.
                We had almost 40 oral evidence sessions and received over 100
                pieces of written evidence. I thank especially the Clerk, the
                Committee staff, the three special advisers, our researcher, and
                all the Committee members for their hard work in bringing this
                substantial report into being.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Sir John Gorman] in the
                Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The level of interest generated by the
                inquiry was heartening. It indicates the importance of the
                subject and the widespread willingness to contribute to shaping
                improvements and policy in these areas and to do so by working
                with the institutions of devolved Government. The Committee
                supports the many initiatives in this area that the Minister and
                his Department have taken since devolution, and our
                recommendations are designed to enhance the impact of many of
                them. We do not underestimate the challenge that we face. Since
                as long ago as the mid-nineteenth century, official reports have
                argued that British schools are failing to meet the needs of
                industry. Even at that early stage a contrast was drawn with
                other countries, notably Germany. We all remember Tony Blair’s
                famous slogan before the 1997 election when he said that his aim
                was &quot;Education, education, education.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All around the world, education for industry,
                technology and the promotion of entrepreneurship has become a
                holy grail for economic strategy and policy. There are, however,
                steps that can be taken at the level of our regional Government,
                and one of those is to make the necessary tough decisions on the
                allocation of spending between Departments. While almost every
                area of public spending claims to be underfunded, it is clear
                from the evidence given to the Committee’s inquiry that higher
                and further education and aspects of training require additional
                significant financial resources.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Employment and Learning
                has a strong case in a climate of interdepartmental competition
                for resources, given that many of its spending activities can be
                seen as investments that will lead to future economic growth
                and, hence, to the resources to fund future public spending.
                Where possible and appropriate, industrial and other
                non-Government sources of funding should be accessed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further action is required to correct the low
                levels of adult literacy and numeracy in Northern Ireland. That
                has been said frequently in the House. Other Departments have a
                responsibility to ensure that that serious problem is not
                perpetuated in future generations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is anxious to maintain a
                geographical spread of further education provision. At the same
                time, there are grounds for some colleges to specialise in
                certain activities, and thereby attempt to secure positions as
                centres of excellence. We should encourage further education
                colleges to improve the statistical database of students and
                staff and to make it more consistent. Where possible,
                information technology modules should be included in further
                education courses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to higher education, the Northern
                Ireland universities have had to cope with a rapid increase in
                student numbers in the last decade. That increase has far
                exceeded the growth in public funding of higher education. That
                is a UK-wide phenomenon, and it has generated considerable
                strain. The Committee shares the concern of those commentators
                who note the serious decline in the real level of funding for
                Northern Ireland university- based research and development in
                the 1990s, which contrasts with its continued growth in Great
                Britain and its recent rapid expansion in the Republic of
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The universities can help themselves through
                the best possible performance in the research assessment
                exercise. At the same time, the Committee supports the creation
                of a separate pot of money, over and above that of the research
                assessment exercise, which can be devoted to research that
                reflects strategic or regional needs in Northern Ireland. I
                declare an interest in that subject, as I am on unpaid leave of
                absence from one of those universities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee wants to see business/education
                links promoted with vigour. It is pleased that the Northern
                Ireland Business Education Partnership now has a wider remit.
                However, the number of teacher placements in industry should be
                increased. In Scotland, one in 14 teachers — roughly 7% —
                has been placed in industry for at least one week. That compares
                to approximately 0·2%, or one in 400, of teachers here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Careers education and guidance is a crucial
                area, and the staff who work in that field should be given
                esteem commensurate with the importance of their work. Careers
                education should be as up-to-date as possible, and therefore
                should make maximum use of information technology. Guidance
                provision should always put the interest of the recipient first,
                rather than any financial interest of a particular teaching
                institution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While we await the completion of the Fulton
                review of the careers service, the Committee recommends that the
                Department give close attention to the recent development of
                careers education in places such as Wales. One cross-cutting
                matter of particular concern is the trend in subjects being
                studied at A level. Young people are voting with their feet
                against crucial disciplines, such as certain sciences and
                mathematics. Everything possible should be done to encourage an
                increase in the popularity of such subjects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even though the Northern Ireland labour
                market may now, sadly, be moving into a cyclical downturn, we
                believe that our findings on sectoral skills shortages are
                likely to be of lasting significance. Although the Committee
                commends the Department’s attempts to better marry types of
                labour demand and supply, more could be done to make the variety
                of agencies involved comprehensible to the private sector. The
                structure of Northern Ireland’s training organisations and
                sectoral training councils should be streamlined, given wider UK
                developments in those areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Above all, it should be recognised that skill
                levels in the Northern Irish workforce, in some respects such as
                sub-degree, technical and craft skills qualifications, fall
                short of those in Great Britain and much of the rest of the
                European Union. In the late nineteenth century, this region was
                one of the workshops of the world. Significant contributions
                were made to global science and technology. What was once true
                can be true again. I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                Employment and Learning (Mr Carrick):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson has already set the context
                for the Committee’s inquiry into education and training for
                industry. It was clear from the outset that the contribution of
                education and training to Northern Irish industry was of
                paramount importance. No one denies that education and training
                have an intrinsic merit in contributing to social and cultural
                worth, and do not need to be justified through economic payback
                alone. Nevertheless, it is vital that both education and
                training systems be geared to meeting economic needs. That
                dynamic must always be present to meet the demands of a
                continually changing labour market. We all have a role to play
                in ensuring that those demands are met efficiently and
                effectively. Furthermore, we must strive together to guarantee
                access for all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the first evidence session of the inquiry
                in June 2000, the economic commentator John Simpson told the
                Committee that it was to be complimented on the ambitious
                breadth of the inquiry. The terms of reference were, in
                retrospect, wide ranging. However, I have been heartened by the
                number of organisations from all sectors in Northern Ireland
                that have taken the time to work with the Committee to help to
                shape future policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the inquiry, several areas emerged as
                vital to education and training systems, around which the report
                has been structured. I want to briefly focus on three areas of
                particular importance. Before I do so, I reiterate the
                Chairperson’s words of appreciation and gratitude to the
                Committee Clerk, his predecessor, the support staff, special
                advisers, and research staff. They were a tremendous
                encouragement to the Committee; they did an excellent job and
                deserve the Committee’s appreciation and gratitude.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I will speak about skills strategies.
                I acknowledge the work that the Northern Ireland Skills
                Taskforce and the Priority Skills Unit have done. A report
                recently published by the task force aims to raise awareness of
                skills issues and to encourage the development of positive
                actions and potential solutions. However, more needs to be done
                to develop a co-ordinated and flexible skills strategy to enable
                Northern Ireland’s education and training sectors to respond
                quickly and appropriately to the changing labour market. Any
                skills strategy must account for the fact that our economy is
                predominantly comprised of small and medium-sized enterprises.
                Their training costs can be particularly burdensome, and they
                find it more difficult to replace any staff released for
                training.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Neither can the low levels of adult literacy
                and numeracy in large sections of the community be ignored. The
                Department for Employment and Learning is preparing an urgently
                needed basic skills strategy, and the Committee looks forward
                eagerly to considering it. I must, however, caution that while
                strategies are important, immediate action is needed. The
                Committee took evidence on the work of Moy Park Ltd to address
                basic skills needs in the Upper Bann constituency. The link that
                Moy Park established with the East Tyrone College of Further and
                Higher Education was especially commendable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee also heard from another
                progressive firm in the Upper Bann constituency. Galen
                (Pharmaceuticals) has had difficulties in recruiting appropriate
                chemistry graduates. The decline in the number of students of
                scientific subjects and mathematics needs to be given serious
                consideration in the current review of the curriculum for 16- to
                19-year-olds. There is a great need for education providers,
                Government agencies and the media to work together to increase
                scientific awareness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Employment and Learning
                has worked hard on the image of the further education sector,
                but much more needs to be done to ensure parity of esteem for
                vocational and academic education. Geographical spread is
                essential to ensure local access to further education and to
                underpin social inclusion. However, that needs to be balanced
                with further movement towards specialisation in support of
                particular sections of the economy and the development of
                centres of excellence as appropriate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department will soon finalise its further
                education strategy, which should address those issues. It must
                guide the allocation of funding for the sector. While I welcome
                the recent improvements in support for further education
                students, the overall per capita funding for students in the
                further education sector needs to be increased if it is to
                achieve its objective of delivering high-class vocational
                training on a par with academic qualifications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several colleges have developed mutually
                beneficial relationships with local businesses, and those should
                provide a template for the whole sector. Further education
                staff, in particular, need to understand the needs of local
                industry. The Department’s Lecturers Into Industry initiative
                has already played a part in that, as have the plans for its
                further development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware from the evidence submitted to the
                Committee that further education colleges are only just
                beginning to develop effective links with industrial development
                agencies. I urge action to ensure that the pace is increased
                with the creation of the Invest Northern Ireland agency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A major review of careers education and
                guidance was carried out in 1995, but there has been only
                limited improvement since then. That area is vital, given
                increasing student numbers in tertiary education. Career choices
                are often not made until its completion. A job is no longer for
                life. Many adults face difficult career choices throughout their
                working lives and need access to career guidance. I was
                extremely impressed by the work carried out by the Education and
                Guidance Service for Adults in that regard.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the Department to complete its
                response to the Fulton report. We need implementation and action
                sooner rather than later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee met the Committee for Education
                and Lifelong Learning from the National Assembly for Wales to
                discuss in depth the issue of careers education and guidance. It
                is clear that we have fallen behind our colleagues in Wales and
                Scotland, who have already opted for career guidance to be
                delivered to national standards in order to counteract the
                fragmented range of services at local level. I hope that we can
                soon achieve a centrally co-ordinated, independent and
                high-quality service to reflect the new curriculum and the needs
                of the economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The path from education through training to
                industry needs greater clarification so that stakeholders can
                understand it more easily. The Department for Employment and
                Learning has made a significant contribution towards ensuring
                that education and training systems respond early and
                effectively to economic indicators. However, much still needs to
                be done, and the Committee looks forward to collaborating with
                the Minister and the Department over the report, which sets out
                the key areas that the Committee believes must be addressed. I
                commend the report to the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a member of the Committee, I endorse the
                report and congratulate the Chairperson and the Deputy
                Chairperson for the way in which they conducted the inquiry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inquiry into education and training for
                industry in Northern Ireland is vital to the training needs of
                our regional economy in the next 20 years. As a region, Northern
                Ireland must compete in a global economy through open
                competition in the EU, and, indeed, in the wider international
                trading context.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The statistics relating to Northern Ireland’s
                gross domestic product (GDP) performance remind us that we have
                a deficit to make up. At present, the average production from
                workers in Northern Ireland equates to 84% of the UK average.
                However, when we compare our production performance with the
                average in either the USA or the EU, we only achieve between 50%
                and 60%. That is a major concern. Performance is not just the
                responsibility of workers; management in Northern Ireland is
                facing a major challenge in trying to improve output.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the key issues that the Committee
                uncovered — and it was made clear through several submissions
                — was the poor level of literacy and numeracy, particularly in
                adults. Approximately 250,000 adults lack basic skills in
                numeracy or literacy. That is a severe handicap to people when
                they try to find employment, above all, in sustainable jobs.
                Skills and training pose a major challenge to education and
                training providers in Northern Ireland, particularly for
                practical skills training and higher technology skills training
                for industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee received a wide range of
                submissions from the further education sector, the higher
                education sector and several community and private training
                providers. We also received a submission from the Training and
                Employment Agency. The Committee was particularly impressed by
                Bombardier Shorts’s submission, which outlined its in-house
                training facilities. The firm’s basic skills training is very
                much tailored to the needs of industry, and it impressed on us
                the need for future skills training to be tailored to those
                interests.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee was also impressed by the
                submission from Letterkenny Regional Technical College, which
                highlighted the importance of further education or regional
                technical colleges as engines of local economic development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee made 43 recommendations, but I
                will not go into detail about those. The Committee found that
                good statistical information on training output and quality was
                lacking. The Department needs a statistical information unit to
                collate, analyse and evaluate skills training. That is much
                needed and would help in the provision of training tailored to
                the future needs of our economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee had a strong desire to see more
                resources put into the Careers Advisory Service, particularly in
                secondary schools and further education colleges. Good careers
                advice is vital if we are to provide young people with the
                opportunity to realise their full potential. Young people must
                understand the different career possibilities that are available
                through academic, vocational or practical training routes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are all aware of the importance of
                university R&amp;D in enabling manufacturing industry to develop
                new products — or adapt existing ones — and thus gain a
                competitive edge. The Committee was concerned at the lack of
                postgraduate students, who are vital to the development of
                research and development in our two universities. Postgraduate
                students will not be interested in R&amp;D unless we also invest
                in the resources that are afforded to postgraduate students. The
                most crucial resource in university R&amp;D is the postgraduate
                student working on a project under supervision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is concerned at the lack of
                co-ordination between the 17 colleges of further education.
                Training provision for practical skills should be spread
                throughout Northern Ireland, not just centred in the two main
                cities or a few other towns. I come from Tyrone, which has a
                good history of providing workers for the construction industry.
                It is important to offer skills training in such rural parts of
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee had a wide-ranging remit.
                Tackling everything dealt with in the inquiry would be too big a
                project. However, it is important that it be used as a benchmark
                for the future provision of skills training in Northern Ireland.
                I commend the report to the House. I hope that lessons can be
                learnt, and that education and training providers can boost
                their contribution, so that young people and adults can avail of
                good opportunities in future.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I welcome the report, and I urge all Members to read it. It is
                evident from the number of oral and written submissions that the
                inquiry was long overdue. We should acknowledge the valuable
                input from education and training institutions, businesses,
                trade unions, the voluntary and community sectors, student
                unions, borough councils and churches.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The submissions from such diverse bodies were
                wide- ranging and informative. If the 43 recommendations are
                adopted, the concept of the intrinsic value of education and its
                relevance to job creation and the economy will be embedded in
                society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The terms of reference of the inquiry were</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;To examine and make recommendations to
                improve the contribution of further and higher education and
                training, including university- based Research and Development,
                to … industry.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a challenge for the Committee for
                Employment and Learning, for the Department and also for
                joined-up government. Those challenges must be met if we are to
                collectively pursue a culture of lifelong learning that will
                create enormous benefits for the individual and for society. We
                must strengthen, develop and mainstream education, training and
                industry and North/South co-operation in order to increase and
                stimulate economic growth. That action must be directed to the
                provision of real jobs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inquiry’s recommendations have assumed
                critical importance in the light of the current downturn in the
                global economy. In order to survive, we must implement them. In
                so doing, we will activate policies central to addressing
                unemployment, deprivation and social and educational exclusion,
                which are the lot of many of our young people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must make difficult choices if we are to
                lay to rest the twin evils of joblessness and poverty. We cannot
                sustain competing economies on this small island. We must set up
                a further and higher education system throughout Ireland, one
                which is open, inclusive and delivers high-quality education and
                training to all. Our overriding need for North/South
                co-operation in research and development was brought home by
                many of the witnesses who gave evidence to the Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A major weakness of the report is its failure
                to identify areas for all-Ireland co-operation that would
                mutually enhance our prospects of competing in the global
                market. That is particularly relevant in the field of training
                provision, and is essential if we are to ensure access to
                third-level education through adequate student finance. I
                welcome the U-turn by the Labour Government in that respect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Current mainstream training is linked to
                British Government macroeconomic policy. That has had major
                implications for the North, such as the lack of adequate quality
                training and job creation. There are regular newspaper headlines
                on the topic — for example, &quot;EU peace money has trained
                22,000 people.&quot; However, we rarely hear how that training
                has produced sustainable, full-time jobs; boosted the economy;
                upgraded the level of skills; or helped young people to build
                confidence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we have read in many submissions, training
                is geared to improving employability. However, it is not linked
                seriously to the provision of real jobs. In the main, the
                approach to training is top-down. That may, in part, account for
                the low skills level in the workforce.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Evidence also suggests that, in respect of
                sub-degrees and craft-trained qualifications, we fall far short
                of the Republic of Ireland, Great Britain and the rest of
                Europe. We must not underestimate the extent of the challenge
                facing us if we are simply to catch up. We recognise the
                initiatives begun by the Minister and the Department to address
                those problems, and we trust that the inquiry and its
                recommendations will speed the process.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a strong case in recommendations 9
                to 19 for proper acknowledgement of and funding for further
                education colleges — and especially those in Newry, Armagh,
                Fermanagh, Omagh and Derry — to enable the development of a
                strategic, cross-border role for delivering basic skills,
                vocational education and training equity. This is despite the
                constraints placed on the allocation of public spending between
                Departments and the significant additional resources required by
                the Department for Employment and Learning. It would be an
                advantage, in the terms of reference and the expansion of the
                recommendations 31 and 33, if the Executive and the Government
                of the Twenty-six Counties could explore the possibility of
                establishing an all-Ireland body to promote and validate
                vocational qualifications such as NVQs, advanced certificates of
                vocational education (ACVES), national diplomas and HNDs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, a LeasCheann Comhairle, I will make
                a plug for my constituency and the development of Derry. It is
                the major alternative site for the growth of full-time higher
                education provision. I ask the Minister to consider establishing
                a working group to advance recommendations for the development
                of higher education in the north-west. This should be done in
                co-operation with the Dublin Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to pay tribute to the Committee staff
                who have done sterling work in the preparation of this report. I
                urge all Members to give it serious consideration. Go raibh
                maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the report, though I was
                disappointed not to receive a copy until Saturday morning. I am
                not a member of this Committee, and to do the report full
                justice more time to study its contents would have been
                appreciated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having said that, it is a good, timely
                report. I suggest that Members read it in conjunction with the
                report from the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment
                on its inquiry into the implementation of ‘Strategy 2010’.
                During the public sessions of our inquiry, and even in oral
                submissions, the question of the relationship between training,
                industry and business came up time and time again. It is
                important that we take an interdepartmental approach towards the
                issues at hand; issues that affect not only the Department of
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the Department for
                Employment and Learning, but the Department of Education as
                well. Dealing with enterprise culture starts at an early age.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I again welcome the fact that on numerous
                occasions Minister Farren and Minister Empey have worked in
                partnership when dealing with pressing issues. There is a
                strategic issue here for the Department for Regional Development
                as well. In ‘Shaping our Future’, reference is made to the
                provision of educational facilities on a regional basis
                throughout Northern Ireland, so an interdepartmental approach is
                required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is critical that the institutions provide
                the skills necessary to meet the needs of the economy.
                Recommendation 8, which rightly draws attention to the fact that
                there is a need to provide skills for small and medium-sized
                enterprises (SMEs), is important. The backbone of industry in
                Northern Ireland is small businesses, and it is important that
                that be reflected in new education provision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By the same token, I acknowledge that when
                Nortel was expanding — before its sad decline due to global
                recession — many further education institutes provided and
                developed the skills necessary for that industry. That was very
                welcome, and devolution has given opportunities to develop such
                provision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw Members’ attention to recommendation
                22 on the need to further increase the number of university
                places in Northern Ireland. The Department is working towards
                that, but far too many young people leave Northern Ireland for
                other parts of the UK and never return. We have lost many of our
                more talented people because there were not sufficient
                university places available in Northern Ireland. I hope that the
                Minister does not mind me reiterating the view that is shared by
                the vast majority of Members about student fees. Those fees must
                be abolished if we are to provide the equality of opportunity
                that is required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 28 refers to New Deal and to
                the need to monitor progress. I agree with that, but the
                Department and the Minister must seriously consider the vacuum
                that has been left with the demise of the ACE jobs. The impact
                of that is still being harshly felt in my constituency. I may
                have been critical of the level of skills development under the
                old ACE scheme, but at least the scheme contributed to meeting
                an important community need, particularly for the more
                vulnerable members of society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 28 also refers to equality of
                opportunity in training. That is an important issue. When the
                Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment was considering
                its report, the need to provide equality of opportunity —
                particularly gender equality — in the workplace became very
                clear. We made recommendations in relation to those matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report quite rightly highlights the
                importance of research and development. That is vital,
                especially given the new circumstances that we face following
                the events of 11 September. However, I am disappointed at the
                delay in setting up the science park in Belfast’s Titanic
                Quarter. I understand that the delay is through no lack of
                enthusiasm on the part of those charged with the task of
                establishing the organisation; rather, it is because of planning
                issues. If we are to have joined-up government and an
                interdepartmental approach, such issues must be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report recognises the importance of
                information and communication technology. That issue kept
                cropping up, so I particularly welcome recommendation 19, which
                states that full-time students in further education should have
                one component in information and communication technology
                training. I ask Members to look back at recommendations 27 and
                28 of ‘Strategy 2010’, which dealt specifically with further
                education and training and the commercialisation of new
                technology, as they deal directly with today’s topic of
                debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a former teacher, I — and I am sure that
                this applies to Assembly Member Carson also — recognise the
                need to provide opportunities for placement in industry for
                teachers, particularly those involved in careers guidance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a good and welcome report, but it can
                only be implemented if the resources are made available. I hope
                that they will be. The development of skills for the
                twenty-first century is vital to the people and communities of
                Northern Ireland, and when we provide the necessary facilities,
                TSN must be taken into consideration. I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the background research commissioned
                for the inquiry pointed to four main problems with education and
                training for industry. The first was the low percentage of
                workforce qualification levels in Northern Ireland. The
                qualification mix is not what Northern Ireland needs, and some
                qualifications are dated. One of the most important conclusions
                was that we do not have enough people with intermediate types of
                skills. Clearly, we must do something about that. The statistics
                for job-related training are also relatively low. Finally,
                employers’ commitment to human resource development and
                investment is also lower than it is elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We know what the problems are. The report
                includes a number of recommendations. I would also advise
                drafting a vision for the future along the following lines: we
                must enhance our human capital; we must have better and more
                flexible training; and education and employment services must be
                targeted towards identified growth services and sectors. One of
                the problems is that too much of our training is supply-driven;
                not enough of it is demand- driven.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, we need to tap into our local
                knowledge and expertise. A major recommendation of the report
                — and this must be part of our vision for the future — is to
                link higher education, further education and our centres of
                research excellence to optimise innovation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, the report points to offering more
                and better pathways to social integration — opening up access
                to jobs and training for those who were previously excluded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fourthly, we must modernise with a broader
                economic base, so as to shift from the old to create the new. We
                must create niches of high-value specialisation. I recognise the
                problem of simultaneously exposing ourselves to the
                vulnerabilities and volatility of modern global markets by
                becoming overdependent on any one particular sector.
                Unfortunately, as we know, Northern Ireland has suffered greatly
                from such overdependence in the past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, we must create high-quality working
                and training environments to induce our talent to stay here and
                at the same time to attract researchers and investors to come to
                Northern Ireland. Much of what we heard was about old
                infrastructure, about buildings that were falling down —
                unattractive environments for people to be trained in and not
                the places that adult learners should be returning to. They were
                put off so much by what they had previously experienced that
                they never wanted to return.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key view of many participants who gave
                evidence was that we needed to build more partnerships.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What struck me very forcibly was the evidence
                that we took from the providers in the South. FÁS, the Irish
                training and employment authority, made the point that it had
                had to go through a period of rapid change. The colleges there
                had to face up to forming consortia: further education colleges,
                or technical colleges as they were formerly known, coming
                together to specialise. However, too many of them were providing
                too much of the same, rather than anticipating changes in the
                labour market and the needs of new investors in a flexible and
                rapid fashion. They have changed enormously, and we could learn
                a lot from that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Currently, colleges in Northern Ireland are
                competing instead of co-operating. Someone needs to take a
                strong hand on that, and I ask the Minister to put in place a
                strategy for further education. The demands are not being met in
                the way that they should. The strategy should be anticipating
                changes as well as attracting young people into further
                education colleges and sending them out well trained, whether
                with modern apprenticeships or the skills that are in demand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The evidence from the district councils was
                interesting. Banbridge District Council made a strong case that
                while district councils, LEDU and local enterprise agencies
                worked together, further education, higher education and the
                T&amp;EA were not currently part of this collaborative effort.
                There needs to be a response to such statements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is concern that a unit should be
                developed. No doubt the Minister will tell us that there are
                agencies or units within the Departments that have some kind of
                workforce strategy and are developing ways to respond to future
                labour market needs. I sit on the Committee for Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety, and I am concerned that the Health
                Minister intends to carry out a workforce strategy, as there are
                enormous shortages. This report relates to industry, but if we
                are to have an interdepartmental approach, it might be useful to
                have a look, right across the Departments, at the workforce
                needs in Northern Ireland, and to have a strategy in place for
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another concern highlighted in the report
                relates to the careers service. Scotland and Wales have tackled
                this problem, brought together a number of providers in
                partnership, and examined how business and education can relate
                to industry. That is not the case in Northern Ireland. A report
                on that will be published shortly, and I cannot anticipate its
                recommendations. However, those giving evidence said that the
                current level of careers advice at secondary school level left a
                lot to be desired. That was a major concern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, they need to develop a mechanism to
                feed information about the skills shortages into the education
                system. An engineering firm made the point that it had huge
                skills shortages, and yet was not aware that teachers and
                careers advisors were knowledgeable about these skills
                shortages. We must modernise our careers service as soon as
                possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would probably be useful to hear about ‘career
                window’. What happened to ‘career window’? It was to be an
                Internet service that could provide information. Resources were
                set aside for that, but it seems to have disappeared. Our
                researchers found that there was a lower use of Internet
                services in Northern Ireland. That is a problem for us. The
                promotion of the Internet among young people is important, but
                we must remember that the socially excluded do not always have
                access to such services. If we have gone down the road of
                introducing ‘career window’, can the Minister say when it is
                to take effect and what its importance to the careers service
                will be?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly there are issues surrounding the
                curriculum — it seems that many of the matters that I am
                talking about begin with the letter &quot;C&quot; — and it has
                been one of the major problems in Northern Ireland. While
                Germany and Sweden have pointed to a mix of academic and
                vocational qualifications, Northern Ireland has done better in
                the academic field than in the vocational field. We need to
                start promoting parity between the two.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a former academic — I should not say
                &quot;former&quot;, given the current state of the Assembly —
                I am conscious that this is a very difficult job. There is a
                problem with the pathway between the vocational and the academic
                — it should be a lattice rather than a ladder. Currently a
                great deal of emphasis is put on academic and professional
                qualifications, particularly by parents. They must be made aware
                that there are many opportunities. The A-level content of the
                new curriculum could be changed accordingly. It is interesting
                to hear that the GNVQ is to be retitled as a &quot;vocational A
                Level&quot;. That may make people look at it differently. Other
                countries have made a better job of this. We can learn from
                their experiences, as the report indicates. The Council for the
                Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment said that the number of
                pupils who currently mix academic and vocational subjects is not
                known. The database is inadequate in that respect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were also very impressed by the promotion
                of the worlds of employment and education through services such
                as the Northern Ireland Business Education Partnership (NIBEP).
                They speak to clusters of businesses. They provide mentors and
                role models. I was particularly taken by the fact that they are
                targeting socially deprived communities. It is too often the
                case that businesses make links only with the grammar school
                sector. So it was important to hear that work experience,
                enterprise awareness and commercial understanding are being
                promoted through teacher placements and school placements. I
                repeat the statistics mentioned by the Chairperson. Scotland was
                able to provide 600 teacher placements, whereas we could provide
                only 45. The statistics speak for themselves. Nevertheless it is
                good to hear that 1,000 business advisers are now participating
                in schools in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">he main theme that comes across is that this
                is now part of the mainstream. When we reflect on our school
                days, how many of us in the Assembly can say that we had
                opportunities to hear from business and industry representatives
                or to go out on work experience? That has changed. However, much
                more needs to be done, and we are concerned about the
                underfunding of organisations such as NIBEP.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We heard about equal opportunities issues and
                barriers to training. The benefit regulations show the need for
                interdepartmental partnerships between the Department for Social
                Development, the Department of Education, the Department for
                Employment and Learning and the Department of Enterprise, Trade
                and Investment. A more co-operative approach must be taken by
                the Departments. There are concerns about the eligibility rules.
                How meaningful is the training for those on the New Deal
                programme? I have heard from constituents who felt that the
                training was demeaning, did not lead to productive employment
                and was simply a way to continue to manipulate the employment
                statistics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The positive action programmes were important
                for women. The Women’s Training, Enterprise and Childcare
                organization (Women’s TEC) talked about the importance of
                giving women confidence in a women-only training environment,
                especially in areas which are traditionally stereotyped as men’s
                jobs, such as construction. They were able to encourage women
                into these jobs and into the area of information and
                communication technology. They also provide on-site childcare.
                The Minister has visited projects where he has seen this at
                first hand, and we encourage him to continue with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were also, as Sean Neeson has pointed
                out, examples from the community of adult learning and
                community-based learning that we should be able to tap in to.
                The Chairperson was able to visit not-for-profit organisations
                in the United States and saw that there seems to be much greater
                collaboration between business and enterprise and community
                leadership. Given the amount of funding that is going into these
                areas, and particularly into the social economy, that is
                obviously something that we should be building on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the major points of the report is the
                need for reorganisation. Representatives from the further
                education sector complained that there are too many private
                training providers and that the sector is unable to compete with
                them. There is a plethora of national training organisations,
                sectoral training councils, and other providers; that is
                creating confusion. A much more strategic approach to training
                is needed. Perhaps there is an urgent need to look at how these
                bodies are collaborating — or are they competing against each
                other? The good practice models of the universities in Northern
                Ireland and the incubator schemes to enable higher education
                providers to reach out to business and the community should be
                encouraged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A major recommendation is that the research
                assessment exercise is not helpful, given that sufficient credit
                is rarely given to researchers who apply their work to a
                Northern Ireland context. I emphasise the Northern Ireland
                Economic Council’s recommendation that 10% of that research
                should be given credit where it applies to the Northern Ireland
                situation. Perhaps that would encourage more academics to
                produce work that is of relevance and that can be fed back into
                the economy here rather than to international journals that are
                not always relevant to Northern Ireland. That would encourage
                applied research so that researchers would not tend to look at
                their work solely from the point of view of how it will enhance
                their careers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, there is the question of an employer
                levy. Is the employer levy productive and should we be
                introducing it? It ring-fences the needs for training. Both
                France and Australia have this. We took contradictory evidence
                in Northern Ireland, and it would not be surprising to hear that
                the trade unions here were in favour of the levy and businesses
                were not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is argued that for such development in any
                country, materials, manpower, marketing, management and money
                are needed. The report addresses, in particular, the issues of
                manpower, skills, education and learning. In the end, the
                Minister will be asked &quot;Where is the money for it?&quot;.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a member of the Committee for Employment
                and Learning, I commend this report to the Assembly. I thank all
                the Committee staff for their hard work — we could not have
                battled through all of the submissions and the reports without
                their being well tabulated for us. I welcome the input into this
                inquiry from industrialists, employment agencies and education
                providers. Sitting there each day, and as a former primary
                school principal, I was extremely worried. We have always had
                pride in our education system and manufacturing expertise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For many years Northern Ireland led in
                industrial development and achieved remarkable export results,
                et cetera, in spite of ongoing terrorism for 30 years. However,
                this view of our education system will change for everybody when
                they read this report and see the evidence from the
                industrialists. The submissions to the Committee catalogued the
                failure of the present system to educate our young people
                properly and prepare them to meet the requirements of industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A submission from one firm gave examples of
                employees who were incapable of doing their job because of a
                lack of literacy and numeracy skills. That can produce an
                adverse effect on production and product safety. The firm’s
                submission stated that some of its employees could not count
                pieces of a product into a bag, identify the letters of the
                alphabet, or identify the days of the week. The firm ended its
                submission with a plea that all students must achieve basic
                levels of numeracy and literacy before they leave school. It is
                not the responsibility of industry, secondary level education or
                higher and further education to tackle literacy and numeracy.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the engineering firms stated that
                careers guidance must be radically overhauled. Another firm
                stated that it had received a visit from chemistry teachers, and
                99% of them had not considered employment in industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The evidence from the Education and Training
                Inspectorate was particularly interesting. The Committee heard
                that the difficulties with literacy and numeracy were common
                across 17 colleges. However, one of the witnesses said he was</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;always slightly bemused when people
                talk about employees who cannot add up to nine, and so on. To be
                honest our evidence is not of a system in further education, or
                anywhere else, dreadfully failing our young people on this
                scale. Of course, there are exceptions, and we dare not be
                complacent&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was not what the Committee was getting
                from other submissions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a former primary school principal I know
                that Members cannot afford to be complacent. The crux of the
                problem highlighted in the report is not about education failing
                young people at secondary or further education level; it is
                about education failing young people at primary school level.
                Screening for problems at primary school level would be a start.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A remedial programme is a necessity for the
                16-plus age group, but the root of the problem is in the primary
                school sector and it should be tackled there. I do not blame the
                teachers; the problem is with the bureaucratic pressure imposed
                on them. I ask for action now, not only for funding of the
                lifelong learning projects and liaisons with industry, but also
                for progress in the primary school sector to solve the problems
                of literacy and numeracy. I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the report. The agreed terms of
                reference were</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;To examine and make recommendations to
                improve the contribution of further and higher education and
                training, including university- based Research and Development,
                to Northern Ireland industry.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part of the Committee’s rationale was to
                determine the way forward for Northern Ireland to increase its
                productivity in the global marketplace. Northern Ireland’s
                productivity is significantly lower than that of its
                competitors. As has already been said, productivity is only 84%
                of that in the UK and just over 50% of that in the USA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Education and training increase productivity
                levels, which in turn increase social inclusion. That, on an
                individual basis, will lead to higher earnings. The Committee
                gathered information from as wide a range of people and
                organisations as possible. The Committee for Employment and
                Learning is supportive of the infrastructure and the initiatives
                that the Minister and the Department have put in place since
                devolution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is a timely contribution to an
                important debate. The economic environment is constantly
                evolving. The Programme for Government states that the Northern
                Ireland Executive is committed to developing a knowledge-based
                economy. The Foyle constituency, which I represent, has seen a
                significant growth in the IT sector, although there is still a
                long way to go in the north-west.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The North West Institute of Further and
                Higher Education in Derry made a significant contribution to the
                evidence gathering. The director of the institute, Peter
                Gallagher, and his deputy, Seamus Murphy, gave much oral
                evidence to the Committee. In addition, Dorothy McElwee and her
                associates from the North West Institute gave oral evidence on
                New Deal. Derry City Council supplied further written evidence.
                The future of our education, skills and development is in
                lifelong learning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The downturn in the world economy after the
                appalling attacks on 11 September will be felt locally. The
                recent announcement from Bombardier Shorts is evidence of that.
                That will be the biggest mass redundancy here in recent times,
                and the knock-on effect has still to be realised. Maydown
                Precision Engineering Ltd in Derry is still waiting to hear if
                its production will be affected. In the run-up to Christmas,
                workers can only hope that the fallout will not affect them too
                badly, if at all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This weekend there was the further
                announcement that Marketing Database Associates Ltd would not be
                setting up in Derry in the foreseeable future. The Boston- based
                firm was to have established a major call centre there. The
                development was announced about six months ago, and the firm
                took over a former shirt factory and employed 26 people. Not
                only will those people now lose their jobs, but the expected 150
                new jobs will not be realised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be a knock-on effect for local
                suppliers. People who supply office equipment and personal
                computers are very much affected. Some of those firms have
                outstanding accounts, and those may be sufficient to put some of
                them out of business. I hope that that is a worst-case scenario
                and that it will not happen. It is therefore more important than
                ever that we should be able to respond with speed, quality and
                flexibility to changes in the demands of industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has made 43 recommendations
                that are all worthy of consideration. I hope that the Minister
                will refer to some of his priorities. I know that he is
                committed to developing a culture of lifelong learning, and
                excellence in learning and training. People are at the heart of
                economic growth. I stress that we need structures built around
                people, not the other way round. Foreign investment adds value
                to the local economy, and we must encourage it. I commend the
                report, and I support the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to put on record my appreciation of
                the staff who collated the information during our oral and
                written evidence taking. It has been worthwhile, and many
                important issues have emerged. I will try not to go back over
                the many issues that have already been covered; instead, I will
                flavour my comments with my own experience and interest. I hope
                that that will be of some benefit to the discussions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I want to comment on recommendation 1,
                which highlights the poor levels of basic adult educational
                skills in Northern Ireland. That is an area that is becoming
                increasingly important, not only to the people involved — and
                because of the social exclusion that may result — but to the
                economy of Northern Ireland. Unemployment levels are much lower
                than they were in previous decades, and we must try to continue
                to improve people’s educational attainments so that they, in
                turn, can take up job opportunities when those exist.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In an answer to a written question, the
                Minister advised me that 44% of the unemployed have no
                educational qualifications. We must continue to target that and
                to improve our education levels. Recommendation 4 is for a
                review of the curriculum for 16- to 19-year-olds, so that it
                will become increasingly relevant. In particular, we have
                highlighted the weaknesses in scientific subjects. I want to
                draw Members’ attention to some of the information that was
                highlighted during the evidence sessions. In particular, there
                may in this detailed report be lessons for members of the
                Education Committee that may not have been immediately obvious.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At one evidence session, Ms Carol Phillips
                from Bombardier Shorts advised the Committee that some students
                were struggling with a course at Belfast Institute of Further
                and Higher Education (BIFHE). The college expected a high
                failure rate, but Bombardier expected and wanted people to
                succeed. Bombardier was willing to do whatever needed to be done
                to ensure that the students in whom it was investing would
                succeed. Bombardier and BIFHE formed a partnership to review the
                students’ curriculum. Time and money was invested in the
                course and the net result of incorporating new projects into the
                syllabus was renewed interest from the students because the
                course was relevant. Following that, students had a 100% pass
                rate where previously they had been failing. It is not rocket
                science. It is a matter of making the course relevant, changing
                the curriculum where necessary and enabling students to retain
                an interest in the subject. That is a basic concept that should
                be applied to all areas in which difficulties are being
                experienced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 10 states that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Decisions regarding the development of
                centres of excellence at individual colleges should stem from
                the overall strategy for the sector.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support that recommendation, which would
                develop expertise and enable some people to specialise, as
                everybody cannot do everything. However, the Committee has added
                a caveat that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;This should be underpinned by a
                commitment to innovative schemes, which increases access and
                supports a geographical spread of provision across Northern
                Ireland.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are saying that basic courses for which
                there is an undoubted demand from all over Northern Ireland must
                be well spread throughout the Province. However, there will have
                to be a degree of specialisation if we are to reach levels to
                enable us to compete with other regions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must plug my own constituency, which
                remains the only one in Northern Ireland to not have a permanent
                further education campus. The people of Larne and Carrickfergus
                are badly served by the current further education structure. The
                lowest wage levels in Northern Ireland are also to be found in
                those towns. A low level of attainment at NVQ level 4 is to be
                found in the same areas. Those issues are all related. Neither
                the informal education structure nor educational bodies such as
                Proteus (NI) Ltd and the Educational Guidance Service for Adults
                have been sufficiently provided for. I strongly support a wide
                geographical spread so that no area is discriminated against and
                the educational needs of all are addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the historical difficulties with the
                informal structure may be related to the relatively low levels
                of community activity in East Antrim. That is another problem
                that the Departments must address collectively so that people
                will be able to get on to the educational ladder to improve
                their own abilities, which will increase their self-worth and
                the opportunities open to them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 17 refers to the establishment
                of</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Closer links with local industry,
                industrial development organisations, including increased staff
                participation in the Lecturers into Industry initiative&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have become aware of past failings through
                my work in the Committee and through my interest in the subject.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was astounded when an assistant director of
                a local college told me that until a couple of years ago the IDB
                had never made contact with a further education college. In the
                USA and Europe, a key factor in an investment decision is the
                local education provision and how it will marry with a company’s
                needs. The IDB has begun to address that issue, and I hope that
                Invest Northern Ireland will dramatically increase interaction
                with local colleges. Introductions should be made so that new
                employers coming into Northern Ireland can feel confident that
                they will receive support. There are, undoubtedly, good examples
                of local colleges that have developed courses with local and
                international companies. That should be standard practice.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Colleges must work towards creating better
                contact with local employers. The Committee’s recommendation
                affects institutions other than the Departments. Everyone
                concerned must try to improve and increase partnerships.
                Partnership is the key word in any developing region, and groups
                should work together for the benefit of all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 26 calls for a more
                comprehensive and streamlined national training organisation and
                a sectoral training council. The evidence highlighted many
                employment sectors that are not covered by the current
                structures. That means that those sectors are not publicising or
                addressing the issues that concern them. There is also
                duplication and overlap. Procedures must be restructured and
                streamlined to bring them into line with the national training
                organisations. In that way we can easily have an input into
                changes — for example, changes to NVQs. We can also contribute
                to the national structure and air the Northern Ireland
                perspective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 36 states the need for an
                independent, comprehensive and up-to-date careers education and
                guidance service. As one of the younger Members of the Assembly,
                I can recall my own school days. Careers guidance consisted of
                two limited 15- or 30-minute sessions. The provision of careers
                guidance rests largely on teachers, who may have a limited
                perspective on the outside world and the needs of industry or
                employers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is potential for conflict, because it
                is difficult for a teacher in one school to recommend that a
                pupil should take up a course in another school. At a time of
                keen competition for student numbers between schools and
                colleges, it is convenient to recommend the easy option that
                pupils should continue their education in the familiar
                surroundings of their current college or school. The full range
                of options may not be given an appropriate airing. Careers
                guidance should be more comprehensive and independent so that
                students are made aware of every employment opportunity. In that
                way they can take a more reasoned view on continuing their
                education or commencing employment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the oral sessions, one of Northern
                Ireland’s leading companies, Galen (Pharmaceuticals), told the
                Committee of its difficulty in recruiting biochemists and
                chemists, even though job opportunities were available.
                Professors at the universities said that places were available
                on chemistry courses, but that they could not get students to
                take those places.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When university places and relatively
                well-paid jobs are available, what is wrong with the current
                structure? Why are those wonderful opportunities not being
                better highlighted to schools and further education colleges?
                Something in the system is surely failing. Unless the
                educational requirements of industry are met, companies will go
                elsewhere or, as with Galen, will recruit from Europe and
                further afield to get the specialisation that they require.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that we build on existing
                opportunities and that young people be shown those opportunities
                at an early stage. It is not enough to encourage people to take
                an O level or an A level in a subject. Clear information should
                be available early on so that students can assess the current
                job vacancies in Northern Ireland and how much they could be
                earning. Students should consider that when choosing their A
                levels and university courses. Currently that information is not
                easily available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was much merit in the information we
                received on the careers guidance service in Wales, where an
                independent service has been developed. I am not saying that it
                should simply be imported en bloc — there are criticisms of it
                — but the concept of an independent guidance service, where
                there is no self- interest and where quality information is
                given to students irrespective of their school or college, is
                there. That service is of high quality; it is up-to-date and
                independent. That is not only desirable but essential if the
                needs of industry are to be met in the future.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you for that useful tip — would that
                others had heard it earlier.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the report on education and
                training for industry. I congratulate the Chairperson, Deputy
                Chairperson, Members and officials involved. The report covers a
                wide range of issues and makes important recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My remarks will be less detailed than I would
                have liked, but I want to make some initial comments. There is
                no doubt that education and training lie at the heart of
                Northern Ireland’s ability to provide a highly competitive,
                skilled and adaptable workforce, capable of meeting future
                demands. That is absolutely vital in a strong and vibrant
                economy. I welcome the Committee’s recommendations to improve
                links between business and education, and those to ensure parity
                of esteem for academic and vocational qualifications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During evidence on the review of post-primary
                education, the Education Committee was told by a number of
                organisations, including the Confederation of British Industry
                and the Institute of Directors, of the shortage of employees
                with the necessary skills and aptitudes for today’s workplace.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The evidence we received overwhelmingly
                suggested the need for parity of esteem between academic and
                vocational qualifications. Our report will be published shortly,
                and it will highlight those issues. We will also carefully
                scrutinise Mr Gerry Burns’s recommendations in his report on
                the review of post-primary education to determine their
                potential and whether they can be implemented into any new
                education system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must record my dismay at the findings of
                the Committee for Employment and Learning on the low level of
                adult literacy and numeracy among large sections of the
                community. There is undoubtedly a link between poor basic
                skills, unemployment and exclusion. The current system has
                failed these people. I hope that initiatives to address their
                problems can be brought forward speedily, and I will
                wholeheartedly support them. While it may be true that the main
                problem lies with people who left school some time ago, there is
                no room for complacency. We must provide young people with those
                skills.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Education welcomed the new
                targets for literacy and numeracy included in the new public
                service agreements, but was slightly disappointed that they were
                lower than those outlined in the strategy for numeracy and
                literacy. We pressed the Department of Education on that matter.
                As a top priority, we will scrutinise and monitor the work of
                the Department to ensure that appropriate action is being taken
                to enable those targets to be at least met and, if possible,
                improved upon, so that young people have the best possible start
                in life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need careers education and guidance to
                assist young people to make the best choices in their careers.
                The report highlights concerns about the quality of careers
                advice and the perception that academic courses are promoted in
                preference to vocational ones.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the recommendation by the
                Committee for Employment and Learning of a system that provides
                a high-quality service to all its users, reflects the
                opportunities available in the economy and equally promotes
                academic and vocational careers. I anticipate appropriate action
                to achieve that in the near future.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fully agree with the Committee’s view on
                the importance of the subject. The Executive have emphasised the
                importance of the subject by including education, skills and
                competitiveness in the Programme for Government. My Department’s
                aim is to promote a culture of lifelong learning and to equip
                people for work in a modern economy. Those aims and objectives
                are reflected in the Programme for Government. They spring from
                the belief that education and training after compulsory
                schooling can and do make a powerful contribution to economic
                position and social inclusion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Universities and colleges create the vast
                majority of our higher level and technical skills; universities,
                as indicated in last year’s report from the Northern Ireland
                Economic Council, provide a more substantial proportion of our
                R&amp;D than is the case elsewhere in the UK and Ireland.
                Colleges and training organisations offer our young people and
                adults a first and a subsequent opportunity to gain a wide range
                of vocational, technical or occupational qualifications that
                allow them to progress to further and higher education or into
                work. Further education, higher education and vocational
                training feed directly into the economy and, as they are helping
                our population to acquire job-related skills, self-confidence
                and self-esteem, they are also promoting greater social
                inclusion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since I came to office I have endeavoured to
                promote policies that are in the best interests of those who
                attend our colleges, training facilities and universities, and
                the employers and public and social institutions who receive
                their skills and attributes. I am grateful for the support for
                these policies contained in the report. I fully accept the
                spirit of the report as a determined effort to develop and
                strengthen education and training and to enhance its
                contribution to the regional economy. It is important to bear in
                mind the general context in which the submissions were made and
                in which the report was compiled. It was compiled on evidence
                that was presented before we had any sense of a recession or a
                downturn in the global economy. Therefore, over the last year
                and further back, we were thinking in the context of significant
                growth continuing over the next few years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Members that more of our people are
                employed than ever before, and that our economy has been
                expanding at a significant rate. Trying to meet the needs that
                were created by the pressures of the expansion of our economy
                has not always been easy, particularly when it comes to skills
                supply. Several Members acknowledged that fact in their remarks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the developments I have been
                responsible for include the establishment of a skills task force
                and the initiation of a series of research projects designed to
                improve our understanding of the demand side of the labour
                market. The task force recently published its first
                comprehensive report, which I commend to Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That report covers much of the ground in the
                Committee’s report, and, set alongside a major monitoring
                survey of skill needs, it complements and supports many of the
                Committee’s conclusions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The support programme for university research
                is another inititiative. Several Members spoke of the need to
                invest much more in locally generated research. The support
                programme will provide over £40 million from a public-private
                partnership over the next four years to invest in the R&amp;D
                infrastructure in both of our regional universities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week, I was privileged to launch one of
                the projects selected as worthy of support by the international
                panel — the Sonics Arts Centre at Queen’s University. This
                will bring together the knowledge and scholarship in the
                creative arts and technology sectors in an intensely creative
                way. It will also provide opportunities for economic and social
                activity, as well as for teaching and research. I was pleased to
                learn that the research that is being undertaken is at the
                frontier of research in that area. The centre could become a
                leading research centre in world terms. The Centre for Molecular
                Biosciences at the University of Ulster will build on the strong
                research record in this area and provide support for the
                university’s technology transfer activities. Those are only
                two of the projects funded through the support programme.
                Several other projects are in the process of development, some
                of which will be launched in the near future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My recent changes to student support, my
                access measures in futher and higher education, my introduction
                of individual learning accounts (ILAs) and learndirect and my
                support for the Northern Ireland credit accumulation and
                transfer system (NICATS) are illustrative of my determination to
                embed the principle of lifelong learning in society and open up
                opportunities for education and training to a much broader
                cross- section of the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of these initiatives,
                participation in learning has grown considerably, and Members
                are aware from recent Assembly Questions that we have had an
                overwhelming response to ILAs in particular. I do not have the
                most recent figures to hand, but over 50,000 accounts have been
                opened, although not all are being drawn down at the moment.
                However, those figures are well ahead of initial projections,
                and I trust that we will be able to meet the demands for finance
                so that people can benefit from educational opportunities,
                particularly in the lifelong learning context that the provision
                of ILAs opens up. I welcome the Committee’s endorsement of my
                existing policy direction in these vital areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will move to the essence of the report. At
                this stage I cannot respond to each of the 43 recommendations.
                Members will appreciate that there has not been sufficient time
                to give them the full consideration they deserve. However, I
                promise to return to those in detail in the near future. I would
                welcome the opportunity to respond in writing and follow that up
                in discussion with the Committee. The report is important and
                deserves no less.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to reflect on some of the main
                themes suggested by the recommendations and relate my response
                to the published strategic plan of my Department. I have
                identified the following five themes: the need for action on
                poor levels of adult basic skills; a sharper focus, in
                particular, on information and communication technology skills
                and on retraining and reskilling the existing workforce or those
                currently unemployed; the strategic direction of further
                education and the issues which flow from that; the contribution
                which the universities can make to the economy and, in
                particular, to developing the enterprise culture; and the need
                to develop training provision and related occupational and
                vocational qualifications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of basic skills has come before the
                House on several occasions, not least through Members’
                persistent questioning of Ministers. The Committee is aware that
                basic skills have been identified in its strategic plan as one
                of the key issues that the Department will face over the coming
                years. I understand the concerns of the Committee and others
                about this. It is a significant challenge that must be overcome
                if the skills levels available in the economy are to be raised
                and if our population is to aspire to social and personal
                advancement and esteem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Officials are working on a comprehensive
                basic skills strategy for adults, which I hope to bring forward
                for consultation within the next two months. I recognise the
                impatience that many people feel about this, and I sympathise
                with them. However, I ask Members to recognise that it is
                complex. Existing approaches, while of benefit, have not brought
                sufficient success. In the 1970s, when I first became involved
                with higher education, an initiative to address that was
                launched with a great deal of publicity, and we live with its
                effects today. We must think carefully about initiatives that we
                launch now to ensure that they will have the desired effect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Asking people to come forward and admit that
                there is a problem is not easy, particularly when it is to do
                with a basic skills deficit. The image of basic skills work must
                therefore be transformed, and a wide and comprehensive range of
                programmes and providers must be involved, including training in
                the workplace. We have had some experience of that through
                initiatives that employers have participated in with other
                education providers, notably further education colleges. Those
                initiatives have met with reasonable and gratifying success and
                have encouraged us to build on them. Standards, curricula,
                assessment arrangements and the professional development of
                tutors must be worked through. Realistic targets must be
                identified. In due course, I will welcome the opportunity to
                share our strategy with the Committee and to seek its support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already mentioned the work of the
                skills task force, which supports our commitment in the
                Programme for Government. I fully acknowledge that we must
                update the relevance and quality of vocational education and
                training if we are to achieve and sustain our goal of an
                expanding economy based on knowledge-based industries. All our
                higher and further education and training providers are aware of
                this aim and are working towards it. We must also remember that
                there is, and will continue to be, a significant demand for
                traditional trades, notably in the construction industry.
                Evidence suggests an absence of candidates for modern
                apprenticeships in those areas. In emphasising the skills
                relevant to the knowledge- based economy, we must not forget
                that many traditional skills will persist. The demand for those
                skills will remain considerable, and that demand must be met. We
                must strike a balance between the two.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current difficulties in the global
                economy have had an impact on Northern Ireland. Members have
                stressed our current situation. In the last year, we have
                attempted to meet the skills shortage in some of the electronics
                sectors by providing a training programme tailored to meeting
                them. We now find that we have difficulty placing trainees who
                completed that programme, which was set up specially to meet the
                pressures that existed in those electronic industries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us hope that the difficulties are
                short-lived. It is to be hoped that we will soon be back into a
                period of expansion, and will again face the challenge of
                meeting skills needs.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise if I cannot get to all of the
                Members’ questions or points. I ask you to indulge me with a
                few more minutes to complete my general overview of the points
                that were raised. I will reply in writing to Members on points
                that I do not address which are of particular concern to them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Careers education has been emphasised by many
                Members. A review is taking place, and Prof Fulton will report
                in the near future. A new course at Magee College is being
                provided to ensure that professional training and development
                exists locally. Members will see a significant change in career
                guidance provision. We must remember that independent career
                guidance is provided through existing jobcentres, so we are not
                totally reliant on the guidance provided at school level. We
                need to work on developing and improving that service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members have referred to the need to
                strengthen and develop relationships with the business
                community, particularly through our further education colleges.
                I certainly endorse that. Members have called for a spread of
                provision within the further education sector, and for a
                concentration on specialisation. Members will recall that
                through funds made available last year, moneys have gone to
                colleges to encourage them to work together. Several colleges
                have formed alliances under these auspices, supported by the
                funds made available. Centres of excellence have been identified
                in many of our colleges — a point made by several Members. Our
                further education sector needs to continue providing the broad
                range of courses that has traditionally been provided.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Frequent reference is made to the institutes
                of technology in the South. I direct Members’ attention to a
                strong warning made to the colleges there by an authority, only
                last week, about the danger of what is described as &quot;upward
                drift&quot;. This, in other words, is moving out of the
                provision of the broad range of vocational, business and
                technical courses in order to try to emulate the universities.
                What we have here is an opportunity to maintain the best of
                both, and in our strategy we will have that very much in mind.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take on board points made with respect to
                the need to keep in touch with developments in how training is
                organised. I note the suggestion by some Members that there may
                well be unnecessary overprovision, and competing provision, in
                some elements of training. It is important to point out that all
                training providers are subject to supervision, evaluation and
                assessment by my Department, and the standards are national, not
                local.</p>

                Curtailed as I am, I trust that I have attempted to indicate a
                positive response and a welcome for the report. It is a clear
                indication of how our Committee system is working well in
                conjunction with Ministers, enabling us to plan effectively for
                the future of those areas that we have responsibility for.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank everyone who spoke, especially the
                Minister, the Chairperson of the Committee for Education and the
                Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment. I quote from George Bernard Shaw:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;He knows nothing; and he thinks he

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The linking of skills and jobs is of general
                interest and not just for us as individual politicians. Certain
                themes have been raised repeatedly in the last two hours. These
                include the need for a comprehensible skills strategy in
                co-operation with the private sector; the urgency of dealing
                with the appallingly high level of poor basic adult literacy and
                numeracy; the importance of having comprehensive careers
                guidance for young people — as well as for those already well
                established in the labour force — and the need to reverse a
                historical trend against funding for university-based research
                and development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise to Members for the relatively
                small period between the arrival of this tome in the post and
                today’s debate. The report has been lodged in the Business
                Office for some time, and we did attempt to circulate the
                relevant recommendations to Committees over a week ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report suggests that workers and managers
                should be able to stand tall as regards qualifications that are
                recognised and interchangeable with those in Great Britain, the
                Republic of Ireland and the rest of the world. Our universities
                should establish research partnerships whenever it is
                appropriate, and that may be in a North/South direction, with
                the rest of the UK, or with the world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I applaud the Minister for his Department’s
                objective of embedding a culture of lifelong learning. The
                Committee will await the result of the current needs and
                effectiveness evaluation to see what extra resources are needed
                to realise that goal and to measure the productivity, efficiency
                and effectiveness of the existing resources. The Committee
                welcomes his commitment to respond quickly to the
                recommendations. I am aware that, to use a school analogy, I am
                racing against the lunch-break bell.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very appropriate that we have debated
                the motion today, because it is about the future. We have done
                so in a harmonious spirit, and I hope that the media will
                reflect that. Earlier, there was at least one school party in
                the Gallery. In a sense we are dealing with their future and the
                future of all the young people of the Province. Few areas are of
                greater significance to a regional Government, therefore I urge
                the House to support the motion.</p>

                on similar subjects, and I propose, therefore, to conduct one

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to support the motion to amend
                the ‘Guide to the Rules Relating to the Conduct of Members’,
                which was initially approved by the Assembly on 14 December
                1999.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Standards and Privileges Committee
                completed an inquiry into the possible appointment of an
                Assembly commissioner for standards. The Committee report was
                considered and approved unanimously by the Assembly on 2 April
                2001. As a result of recommendations contained in the report,
                several changes to the ‘Guide to the Rules Relating to the
                Conduct of Members’ are required. The motions in the Order
                Paper reflect the necessary amendments. Some additional changes
                are required because of inaccuracies or omissions in the current
                guide.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first motion proposes the deletion of
                paragraph 3 of the guide and the insertion of the suggested
                wording. That change will take into account the additional
                paragraphs 73 and 74 to the guide. The remaining motions propose
                the deletion of other specified paragraphs of the guide and the
                insertion of the wording given in the Order Paper. Paragraph 10
                will be amended to take account of the provisions of section 35
                of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, which permits the Secretary of
                State to</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 33 will be amended to include the
                word &quot;influence&quot;, which was omitted from the original
                guide, thus extending its coverage. Paragraph 67 will be amended
                to provide clarification of privilege as it relates to
                complaints against Members.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 68 will be amended to provide for
                all complaints to be referred to the commissioner for standards,
                in accordance with one of the recommendations in the Committee’s
                report. The amendments to paragraphs 69 and 70 reflect two of
                the recommendations in the Committee’s report about reporting
                arrangements between the commissioner and the Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment to paragraph 71 reflects one of
                the recommendations in the Committee’s report about the
                procedures involved in the Committee’s reporting to the
                Assembly. The amendment to paragraph 72 reflects one of the
                recommendations of the Committee’s report. Standing Orders
                empower the Committee on Standards and Privileges to recommend
                sanctions against Members, but the Assembly will still have the
                final say.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, paragraphs 73 and 74 have been
                renumbered. There is no change to their substance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All these amendments reflect some of the
                provisions of the Committee’s report on the appointment of an
                Assembly commissioner for standards, which was endorsed by this
                House in April this year. I commend the amendments to the House,
                and I ask Members to support the motion.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, I
                will take questions 1 and 14 together as they both relate to
                Holy Cross Girls’ Primary School in north Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about disruption and attacks
                on pupils at any school. I am therefore concerned about the
                situation surrounding Holy Cross Girls’ Primary School and the
                disruption and anxiety caused to teachers, pupils and parents.
                All parents have the right to escort their children to school
                free from impediment, and children have the right to be educated
                in a safe and secure environment that is conducive to learning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The protest is unacceptable and must end
                immediately. The Department of Education will continue to
                support the board of governors, the Council for Catholic
                Maintained Schools (CCMS) and the Belfast Education and Library
                Board in their efforts to ensure that that is achieved for the
                pupils attending Holy Cross Girls’ Primary School and the
                nearby controlled school, Wheatfield Primary. Departmental
                officials are in regular contact with the relevant education
                authorities and are monitoring the situation closely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Additional support has been provided to Holy
                Cross Girls’ Primary School and, along with the CCMS and the
                Belfast Education and Library Board, the Department is
                considering what further assistance may be required by the two
                schools. In addition, the Executive have established an
                interdepartmental liaison group of officials and have appointed
                a senior liaison officer who works from an office in north
                Belfast that is accessible to all sections of the community.
                That group has been established to provide regular reports to
                the Executive on the situation, and the Department of Education
                is represented on that group at a senior level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the Department of Education, along with
                the CCMS and the Belfast Education and Library Board, is
                providing that support, the situation at Holy Cross Primary
                School can be resolved only by dialogue between the local
                communities. I have repeatedly urged local representatives to
                come together to resolve their issues.</p>

                ended by 9 November, the date of the first test. Funding has
                been agreed to enable the teachers to provide additional
                curriculum support to pupils at Holy Cross who are taking the
                transfer test this year. The Department has also been in touch
                with the school authorities, who will take appropriate steps to
                ensure that the children can take the transfer test in a calm
                and orderly atmosphere. The Department and the statutory
                education authorities will do all that they can to help the
                school achieve that.</p>

                Glengormley High School and Newtownabbey Community High School,
                all of which have been attacked in the past few weeks? I spoke
                to officials from Translink today, and there have been somewhere
                in the region of 146 attacks since 3 September. Are any
                initiatives being implemented to ensure that Protestant children
                can travel to and from school without attack? Are teachers being
                given advice on how to help with that?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My feelings on the situation in the north
                Belfast area have been made abundantly clear during this period,
                which has been so detrimental to the pupils, their parents and
                society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Attacks on school buses are absolutely
                despicable and deplorable, and the Department keeps all of this
                under constant review. Recently I have issued countless
                statements calling on all those responsible for the attack and
                intimidation of schoolchildren to bring their activities to an
                end. Community and political representatives have a huge
                responsibility to state their opposition to the ongoing abuse of
                children. It does not matter which section of society, school,
                or school bus is involved; attacks, intimidation, threats, and
                abuse of children are totally unacceptable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly has an important role to play.
                Several Assembly Members have recently made positive efforts to
                encourage dialogue within the community to have this resolved. I
                commend them for their initiative. They must be supported by
                Members from other political parties. There is a responsibility
                on everyone in the House to ensure that we play as constructive
                a role as possible. We can make it perfectly clear to everyone
                that it is unacceptable to attack children and that it should
                end immediately.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s reaffirmation of
                the right of parents to bring their children to school safely.
                Fr Troy, the chairman of the school board of governors, has
                suggested that parents may choose to bring their children to
                school by car or bus given the current onset of inclement
                weather. At the same time, they can maintain the right or the
                option to walk their children to school. What is the Minister’s
                reaction to that suggestion?</p>
                <b>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fr Troy and Anne Tanney, the principal of the
                Holy Cross Girl’s School, have played heroic roles in the
                defence of children and their right to education. I salute their
                leadership and the way in which they have managed a difficult
                situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The right of access to all schools must be
                maintained; it is vital that people have right of access.
                However, it is for parents to decide how their children get to
                school. Parents will have my fullest support whatever their
                decision. That is the only basis on which we can proceed. People
                have the right to bring their children to school; they have a
                right to decide what transport they will use.</p>

                of human rights issues throughout the education system,
                particularly in schools. Human rights and equality are central
                tenets of the Good Friday Agreement. As part of the process to
                raise awareness of human rights, the Department recently held a
                conference on human rights in education, at which I announced
                several specific initiatives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the Department is funding the
                appointment of an advisory teacher for a period of two years,
                who will be based in the Children’s Law Centre. This person
                will develop human rights information and learning materials.
                Secondly, I have given my approval to the appointment of five
                teachers who, working in conjunction with the Human Rights
                Commission, will assist in raising awareness of human rights
                issues in post-primary schools, including the consultation on
                the recently launched proposed bill of rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The curriculum also has an important role to
                play in raising awareness of human rights issues. Members may be
                aware of the work being carried out by Prof Alan Smith and Mr
                Michael Arlow of the University of Ulster. That pilot project in
                a citizenship curriculum is firmly based on human rights values.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department and I will continue to work in
                partnership with the Human Rights Commission and those in the
                education sector to ensure that human rights issues remain high

                should have no place in the vocabulary of any educationalist?
                Given the extended timescale he has announced, the common

                behaviour is unacceptable and should be addressed by schools as
                part of their existing discipline policies. Many schools have
                voluntarily developed a separate anti-bullying policy. I intend
                to strengthen that by taking the next legislative opportunity to
                make it a mandatory requirement for every school to have and to
                implement an anti-bullying policy. My Department recently issued

                educational needs is the statutory responsibility of the
                education and library boards. It depends on the assessment made,
                and provision indicated, in each child’s statement of special
                education needs. However, not all children with dyslexia will
                have such statements. The provision for children with dyslexia
                is broadly similar across all five boards. Most provision can be
                made in-school with supportive organisation and planning.
                Sometimes outside assistance is given by an education and
                library board reading centre or by peripatetic, or outreach,
                literacy support. That assistance may include advice or
                in-service training for the class teacher and the school’s

                learning difficulties are particularly severe. In such cases the

                the key features of the programme. It is designed to promote
                high-quality pre-school provision that has been applied

                called at 11.00 am, and the lady was told to be ready at 1.00
                pm. The ambulance eventually arrived at 5.00 pm, so that lady
                waited all day to travel four miles. I should have thought that
                in urgent cases, when people are extremely ill, an ambulance was

                be money well spent? The Minister has already told the Health
                Committee that a modest saving could be made in the trusts and

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I invited the Member to write to me in April,
                and I reiterate that invitation today with regard to those
                questions. I am very aware that, due to the pressure on the
                system, some patients face unacceptable delays in receiving
                ambulance transport home. In some trusts, therefore,
                supplementary arrangements are being made with voluntary car
                drivers, private taxi firms or private ambulance services to
                ensure that such delays are kept to a minimum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the financing of that, trusts
                need to ensure that their arrangements for the provision of
                services reflect efficient and cost-effective use of limited
                resources. That could involve the private sector where
                appropriate. The type of transport given on the day clearly
                depends on the clinical condition of the patient, and that
                information is normally communicated to the ambulance service by
                the clinician making the request for transport.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have spoken on several occasions about the
                restructuring of health and personal social services. Members
                know that the Executive are looking at public administration.
                However, I warn people that these moves, when they come about,
                will not solve the problems of health and social services, which
                have been underfunded for many years.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Homefirst Community Trust projects a
                potential overspend of £1·6 million. The trust has submitted a
                contingency plan to the Department that outlines options to
                address the potential deficit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are several reasons for the difference
                in funding and service levels across trusts. The key factors
                that contribute to that are the size and age of the populations
                they serve and the relative level of need in those populations.
                The elderly, for example, make more intensive use of care
                facilities than the rest of the population. It is also accepted
                that levels of morbidity and need are higher in deprived areas.
                The profile of local services is sensitive to those issues, and
                the demand for acute hospital services has also shown a dramatic
                increase in recent years, which has created particular problems
                for those trusts that provide such services.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that a deficit of £1·6 million
                is significant for a community trust. Can the Minister estimate
                the costs that are currently incurred by acute hospital trusts
                because of problems such as bed blocking? Many other problems
                can occur; for example, in the field of psychiatry, the simple
                failure to provide community services when problems become more
                acute and must be dealt with by inpatient services is resulting
                in greater costs than there would be if the problems were dealt
                with by community-based teams. Homefirst Community Trust appears
                to be having to remove post-operative community staff. Is the
                Minister not concerned that, once again, the acute hospitals are
                wagging the entire departmental dog?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not agree with the suggestion that acute
                hospitals are wagging either a departmental dog or an entire
                service dog. They are part and parcel of an integrated service.
                I have stated in the past that all community services are
                important, and the Member will know that a community care review
                of services for the elderly is in the early stages of examining
                the impact of delayed discharge.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recognition of the impact that that will
                have, I provided several million pounds in August for services
                in the community. On the difficulties that acute hospitals and
                health trusts are facing, 12 trusts have prepared contingency
                plans to address their deficits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have stated time and again, here and
                elsewhere, that the current financial position is based on a
                history of the failure of resources to keep pace with demand. I
                am therefore trying to secure additional funding for health and
                personal social services for the coming years from the Minister
                of Finance and Personnel and from Executive Colleagues. The
                funding is needed to address the specific cost pressures that
                all trusts face in coping with the unprecedented demand on our
                health and social services. I know that Members will be debating
                that issue, among others, in the debate on the draft Budget
                proposals that the Executive have brought forward.</p>

                plans, which are agreed annually with their main commissioners

                to endorsement by my Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Boards are responsible for funding health
                trusts to meet the costs of the services that they provide. The
                Department encourages the boards to use its capitation formula
                to inform their allocations, and it has produced guidelines to
                assist them in that task. The Department does not insist that
                the boards mechanistically apply the formula. However, I want to
                ensure that the boards use the formula to inform their decisions
                on how that formula should operate at local level. Under the TSN

                boards will be expected to demonstrate that resources have been
                applied equitably.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise that there is a need to increase
                funding in community services, particularly in the Northern
                Board area. However, the Department’s ability to address that
                issue is constrained by the overall level of resources
                available. I am aware that there have been ongoing discussions
                between Homefirst Community Health and Social Services Trust and
                the Northern Board on the levels of home-help provision and the
                resources available to the trust.</p>

                sustainability factor should be a core consideration in any
                review strategy for acute hospital services? Given that the
                Hayes review considered accessibility only, will the Minister
                assure us that sustainability will now feature strongly in the
                Department’s final deliberations on the future of acute
                services? Can she further assure us that the people of Tyrone
                will not be dealt a mortal health blow as a result of the Hayes
                review’s proposal for the Tyrone County Hospital? The hospital’s
                viability has been put in jeopardy. There seems to be a constant
                threat to its well-established and excellent range of medical
                and acute services, in particular its ear, nose and throat and
                renal dialysis departments and its associated supporting

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McElduff has put down a question regarding
                funding for the Tyrone County Hospital. The answer to that may
                well be of interest to Mr Byrne. The report that was issued for
                consultation contains far-reaching proposals that I will
                consider with Executive Colleagues. I issued the report for an
                initial pre-consultation period, to last until 31 October 2001,
                so that Members, the public, Health Service staff and those
                patients or prospective patients who will be affected by
                proposed changes can raise issues. At the end of that period I
                will examine the issues raised, including those that Members
                mention today and others that have been raised in letters to the
                Department.</p>

                been taken or will be taken prior to consultation and that any
                proposed changes to the long-term future of our acute hospitals

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must reiterate one question that was asked
                by Mr Byrne, because the Minister has not answered it. Does the
                Minister agree that sustainability of hospital services is a key
                consideration in determining the future profile of acute
                hospital provision? Will she take that into account when
                considering the site for a new hospital for the rural west as
                part of a review of acute services in Northern Ireland?
                Furthermore, I note from an edition of ‘the Irish News’ of
                last week that pre-consultation meetings are to be held in
                Belfast this Thursday and in Londonderry on the 23 October. Can
                the Minister tell us when such pre-consultation exercises will
                be undertaken in the rural west?</p>

                meetings that may take place in his area. Several factors were
                brought to my attention in the pre- consultation period and will
                be considered when we look at the overall picture. I stress
                that, at this point, the review is pre-consultation. Following
                discussion with Executive Colleagues and examination of any
                proposals for changes in the future, including the issues that
                the Member has mentioned, those proposals will be put out to
                consultation. All proposals will be subject to an equality

                services in either the Tyrone County Hospital or the Erne
                Hospital? People in Tyrone County Hospital are fearful — and
                this has already been put to the Minister by a delegation —
                that someone is already implementing a report that is only
                consultative in nature but which is being interpreted as a final
                outcome. Can the Minister assure both hospitals that there will
                be no diminution of service in the meantime?</p>

                effort to be made to maintain existing services. Where, for any
                reason, this proves impossible, any changes made must be the

                Hayes addresses the issue of sustainability very well — people
                from those areas should read the report. The Minister said that
                the decision would be taken in 2002. Will she agree with me that
                it is vital, as far as services and sustainability in those
                hospitals are concerned, that the date be sooner — as early as
                possible? Can the Minister say how early the decision could be
                made?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh is the third Member to raise the
                question of sustainability. I reiterate that I will be looking
                carefully at the recommendations in this area, along with other
                recommendations and matters brought to my attention. I will of
                course want to hear the views of everyone affected by the
                proposed changes, as well as those health professionals who
                deliver the services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have stated clearly that following
                discussions with Executive Colleagues I expect to be able to
                make decisions in 2002 and that we will have proposals brought
                forward for consultation. I want to resolve the uncertainty
                about the future of our hospitals as soon as possible. As the
                Member knows only too well, some factors are completely outside
                my control, and they may influence the timing of decisions on
                these important issues. For example, if the former First
                Minister goes ahead with withdrawing Ulster Unionist Ministers
                from the Executive, that may delay both the consideration of the
                initial public reaction to the recommendations in the review
                group’s report and also the planned public consultation on
                proposals for the way forward. The matter can only be discussed
                if there are Executive Colleagues. I cannot give people a
                guarantee, but I can explain my plans for the way forward. I am
                basing my timing on conditions that I have some control over.</p>

                Is it still above the recommended 70%? What steps have been

                implementing the recommendations of the Chief Medical Officer’s

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In percentage terms, it is difficult to make
                direct comparisons. There are different systems in different
                places. We looked at the Chief Medical Officer’s
                recommendations, as well as the guidelines from the Clinical
                Resource Efficiency Support Team (CREST), and they suggest that
                between 1% and 2% of our acute beds should be provided for
                intensive care. Currently, the figure is approximately 1%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am committed to ensuring that all patients
                receive the treatment that they expect and deserve. That is why
                I asked the Chief Medical Officer to progress that review prior
                to the Assembly’s first suspension. Demand for intensive care
                continues to increase as a result of recent advances in medicine
                and surgery. The increased provision of intensive care and high
                dependency beds of the past year, together with the plans for
                future expansion, will contribute significantly to the care of
                very ill patients.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have increased the number of beds
                available. Of the 26 recommendations in the Chief Medical
                Officer’s review of intensive care services, nine have been
                fully implemented and plans are in place to implement the
                remainder over the next three years. An extra 10 intensive care
                beds and 11 high dependency beds have been provided, and there
                are plans for a further expansion of high dependency provision.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister aware that the lack of
                adequate numbers of intensive care beds has led to one of our
                top consultant surgeons leaving the Province? There was not
                enough work for consultants, due to a shortage of beds after
                surgery. Does the Minister recognise that many patients who
                require cancer treatment are taken into wards and starved the
                night before they are scheduled to have their operation, only to
                be told that the operation cannot take place because the
                intensive care bed that they require has already been taken?
                Does she further recognise that the extra beds that have been
                provided in the Royal Victoria Hospital will not meet those
                people’s needs?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is inappropriate to suggest why a
                consultant might have left a position and moved elsewhere,
                unless that consultant expressed a reason. I am not aware of any
                such suggestion in this case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have looked at the availability of
                intensive care and high dependency provision, and I realise that
                there is work to be done. I explained that in my answer to the
                previous question. It should be realised that a considerable
                amount of high dependency and intensive care provision has
                already been brought into service, and there are plans for
                further expansion of high dependency provision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been advised that most cancer patients
                requiring surgery do not need an intensive care bed. However,
                the increased provision of intensive care and high dependency
                beds that has already taken place, together with plans for
                expansion, will make a significant contribution to the care of
                very ill patients. Worthwhile work has been done. There are some

                underlying trends and causes. Each Department must address its
                own cultural problems. I have no indication of serious problems
                of lack of care in any one Department. The point of these
                statistics is to identify any problems that exist. That task

                Comparisons of absenteeism levels can be made. Unfortunate
                comparisons have been made between the absenteeism levels in the
                Civil Service and those indicated in a postal survey carried out
                by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). I caution that
                the figures in the CBI report do not provide a meaningful
                comparison, as they deal with absenteeism across the United
                Kingdom in a range of private sector organisations of very
                different sizes, and are calculated on a different basis. They
                do not allow for the sort of factors that are taken account of

                accountability that the Assembly and other institutions afford.
                However, I do not believe that those pressures are expressing
                themselves in absenteeism levels.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Earlier this year, the then First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister met with the Chancellor of the
                Exchequer to discuss a range of issues, including the operation
                of the Barnett formula. Senior officials in the Department of
                Finance and Personnel have also had a series of meetings with
                Treasury officials to discuss Northern Ireland’s funding
                allocations as determined by the Barnett formula. The 2002
                spending review sets the context for negotiations on the Barnett
                formula with the Treasury.</p>
                <b>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that the Barnett
                formula is not widely understood, and that Northern Ireland is
                distinctly disadvantaged by it? Resources for our health,
                education, roads infrastructure and other public services are
                inhibited by the Barnett formula. We need to renegotiate it, and
                our local Ministers need to display the type of flair,
                creativity and imagination that will allow them to use resources
                to the utmost effect.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am happy to agree with the Member that the
                nature and detail of the Barnett formula are not widely
                understood. Since devolution, people have become very familiar
                with the term, and the need for it to change has been a constant
                refrain in this Chamber. We also need to recognise that while we
                have one particular view of the effects of the Barnett formula
                on ourselves and how those effects can be compounded over time,
                other areas do not see its impact and our needs in the same way.
                We need to recognise that there are other regional views and
                there are other questions for us to face in regard to the
                spending levels of some of our programmes.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While we can argue that some key programmes,
                such as health, are being increasingly jeopardised by the
                Barnett formula, others can point to spending programmes where
                we are continuing to spend at a rate considerably higher than
                the UK average. That raises issues for us concerning the
                prioritisation of, and within, spending programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Member that we cannot always
                be looking for more money from the Barnett formula or from some
                other funding formula. We must do more with the money we have.
                We must provide the essential services needed by the most
                efficient and effective means possible, and thereby release
                valuable resources to develop other services.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his reply, although
                I am surprised by it. He is aware that I have attempted to table
                questions to individual Ministers regarding the possible release
                of moneys from their respective budgets, only to find that those
                questions were kicked into touch through being referred to him.
                Is this a case of passing the buck? Is someone afraid to grasp
                the nettle?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has asked Ministerial Colleagues a
                series of questions. He asked several Ministers if they would be
                prepared to release £10 million from their departmental budgets
                next year to the Department of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety’s budget. The questions were referred to me
                because they are common to the Budget; they are not specific to
                any individual Department. The questions are relatively
                speculative.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Budget deliberations, the Executive
                set out to achieve more room to manoeuvre than the Executive’s
                position report indicated that we had. We examined several
                options and tested several issues including uniform cuts in
                resource budgets across Departments; uniform curbs on
                departmental running costs; and an examination of other means to
                release more assets. Departments made clear the difficulties
                they would have if they were to get a smaller allocation than
                last year’s indicative allocations had suggested.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive recognise that there are very
                real pressures on all Departments. However, we also recognise
                that there are very acute pressures on Health Service spending,
                and that is one of the reasons why in this draft Budget the
                allocation for the Department of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety has increased significantly above the indicative
                allocation that was announced last December for 2002-03. The
                Executive have tried to address the particular pressures within
                the Health Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will appreciate that the Executive
                had the benefit of the report from the Committee for Finance and
                Personnel on the Executive position report, which reflected the
                views of the various departmental Committees. There was no
                suggestion in the various departmental contributions that any of
                them could do with less money. On the contrary, representatives
                underlined the needs and pressures of their own Departments.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not only the release of moneys that is
                needed to alleviate the crisis in the Health Service. Does the
                Minister agree that his Department must also monitor the
                spending on health board offices, such as those of the Ulster
                Community and Hospital HSS Trust, to ensure that money is spent
                cost-effectively?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Funding levels do not determine the full
                value that can be obtained, through services, out of public
                expenditure. As I have previously said, we must not only ensure
                that we have bids and ambitions for services; we must also have
                sound plans. Those plans need to be implemented efficiently and
                effectively.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It falls to Departments to manage the more
                precise allocations beyond the general headings that are
                presented in the Budget. It also falls to those Departments to
                monitor the performance and effectiveness of the public bodies
                and other entities that are used to deliver departmental
                services and programmes.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the crisis in the Health Service, what
                consideration has been given to reallocating funds which have
                been put into the Executive programme funds but which have not
                yet been placed in any destination?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive programme funds are an
                important device created by the Executive, in the context of
                devolution, to try to drive a wedge between the patterns of
                spending that we inherited and the patterns that we need to
                create under devolution to reflect our distinctive priorities.
                There has already been one significant tranche of allocations
                from Executive programme funds and there will be another one
                soon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will be aware that some advance
                commitments have been made to cover, for instance, the gas
                pipelines and the commitment to expenditure on roads that was
                reflected in the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In looking at further allocations from
                Executive programme funds, the Executive are well aware of some
                of the pressures that are facing particular services, not least
                the Health Service. We have already allocated significant funds
                from Executive programme funds — including the infrastructure
                and capital renewal fund — to the Health Service. There is no
                reason to believe that the Department, with its service
                pressures, will not be in a position to usefully bid for
                allocations from Executive programme funds in the future.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Peace II programme is a complex
                programme, under which a range of detailed stages had to be
                completed before calls for projects could be made. Those stages
                have now been completed or are nearing completion. Intermediary
                funding bodies have been appointed as implementing bodies under
                the programme, Departments are finalising arrangements for the
                measures for which they are responsible, and the detailed work
                of establishing new local strategy partnerships is nearing a
                conclusion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Calls for projects will be issued over the
                coming weeks for some of the main aspects of the Peace II
                programme, with grants likely to be awarded from December or
                January onwards. As funding bodies call for projects, the
                application forms, and guidance on how to apply, will be
                available from the Department of Finance and Personnel and the
                Special EU Programmes Body web site.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The extension to the gap funding arrangements
                that I announced recently will ensure that funding continues for
                projects until the formal application and selection processes
                have been completed.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his answer. Can he
                confirm that the recent gap funding announcement will enable
                front-line community groups to carry on their vital work? Does
                the Minister agree that that would not have happened under the
                direct rule status to which some parties here would have us

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recent announcement that extends the
                current round of gap funding should go a long way to ensuring
                that funding for projects continues until the formal application
                and selection processes for Peace II have been completed. In
                this context, I agree that the relatively ready access of
                community and voluntary groups to Ministers in the devolved
                Administration has allowed concerns to be voiced directly to
                Colleagues and me. In turn, this has meant that we in the
                Departments have been able to take these considerations into
                account when planning and managing European structural funds and
                wider public expenditure issues.</p>

                answer, particularly with regard to the gap funding
                arrangements, which will allow continuity to enable existing
                projects to enter into the next phase. In general that is to be
                welcomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister confident that the Peace II
                programme will successfully address the difficulties we
                encountered in securing applications from the rural Protestant
                community? Will it redress the imbalance of the previous
                programme that was admitted to in the House by his party
                Colleague and present Acting Deputy First Minister?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The arrangements for Peace II have involved
                extensive and elaborate consultation and monitoring exercises as
                well as evaluations of Peace I. We learnt lessons from Peace I
                about measures, schemes and models that worked, but we also
                recognise that more has to be done in the targeting of some
                areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point that the Member refers to was
                supposed to be the subject of some significant admission by
                Séamus Mallon, which was reflected in an interim report a
                couple of years ago by Northern Ireland’s three MEPs who
                recognised that there was an imbalance. In that letter they also
                stated that there was no question of discrimination, that it was
                to do with patterns of application rather than with any skewing
                of allocations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Horizontal principles will apply in the next
                programme. They include strong consideration of equality and
                balanced intervention. The horizontal principle is one in which
                all Government Departments have a conscientious interest, as
                does the European Commission. That interest has been reflected
                by the three monitoring committees of the Peace II operational
                programme for building sustainable prosperity and the community
                support framework monitoring committee. That interest will be

                However, I am being facetious.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Returning to the serious matter of the Peace
                II funding packages, does the Minister accept that the process

                are at the end of their tether waiting for the situation to be
                sorted out? We have heard promise after promise that this would
                be dealt with, and each time the Minister has been asked about
                it on the Floor of the House we have been told that it would
                happen tomorrow. Tomorrow never seems to come. Now that we have
                reached the end of the tunnel, can the Minister give us a
                categorical assurance that every effort will be made to hasten
                the entire process? Will he devote his efforts, and those of his
                officials, to making sure that he can deliver on time, as many
                groups are suffering greatly as a result of the delays that his
                Department has overseen?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First of all, I refute any suggestion that my
                Department has been responsible for delays. Bringing the Peace
                II programme to land has been slow and painful. However, we have
                to remember that the community support framework is a document
                of the European Commission, and that was only agreed to last
                December. The Department was unable to move on the operational
                programmes and the programme complements until the Commission
                had delivered the community support framework. Following
                agreement on the operational programmes, the Department moved to
                agree the programme complements. Those were signed in March,
                meeting EU regulations.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Finance and Personnel and
                other Departments have worked to ensure that the targets and
                timetable requirements of EU legislation were met. The
                Department has also set up monitoring committees that are more
                effective and meaningful for this round of community support
                framework money than was the case in the last round. Parties in
                the House are represented on those monitoring committees, as are
                a range of other interests. Everyone involved in the exercises
                is aware of the quality and intensity of the effort that has
                been expended by my officials. The Department is now determined
                to follow through quickly for Peace II money. The Department has
                not been able to achieve that as early as it would have liked,
                and is, therefore, making further arrangements for gap funding.
                The Department has now moved forward with other aspects of Peace
                II. Some calls for projects are now taking place, and more will
                follow. The Department is moving with all possible speed.</p>
