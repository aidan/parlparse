                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At an earlier sitting of the Assembly the
                First Minister asked me to clarify those situations when I rule
                on parliamentary language and personal statements. Decisions on
                parliamentary language and personal statements are made under
                the guidance outlined in ‘Erskine May’. It may be helpful if
                I outline these principles in two particular areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If an unsubstantiated allegation of criminal
                behaviour is made in the course of other comments and about
                another Member, I shall regard it as unparliamentary language
                and treat it as such. If an unsubstantiated implication of
                criminal or similarly disreputable behaviour is made of another
                Member in the course of other comments, I shall — if requested
                — give the Member accused a brief opportunity to reply.
                However, on other matters that relate to unparliamentary
                language and to the circumstances of personal statements we
                shall continue to follow the guidance outlined in ‘Erskine May’.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Would it not
                be a good thing for the House to consult Standing Orders and
                make provision, as in ‘Erskine May’, for a personal
                statement from a Member who feels aggrieved?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members have pointed out that
                Standing Orders are not as complete as they could be. Members
                holding such views should draw them to my attention or to the
                attention of the Committee on Procedures. If they are drawn to
                my attention I shall notify the Chairperson of the Committee on
                Procedures, Mr Conor Murphy. If they are drawn to the attention
                of the Committee on Procedures directly, I trust that it will
                deal with them appropriately and will bring them to the House
                for an appropriate decision.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will be aware that today is the
                culmination of many months’ work on the spending allocations
                for 2001-02 and on the indicative allocations for the following
                two years. I regret the timetable that we have had to adopt and
                I appreciate the difficulties that it has caused many people —
                not least the Committees, particularly the Finance and Personnel
                Committee. I am determined that better timetables and procedures
                will apply in future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, on this occasion and in these
                circumstances it has been necessary to eat into the Christmas
                recess to enable this debate to take place. This may be
                unsatisfactory, but it seems to me that the family-friendlier
                option is to conclude the debate today, as the alternative is a
                long debate tomorrow, which would be even less welcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For that reason I propose that we suspend

                the Assembly, there will be no limit on the length of the
                debate, save what seems reasonable to the Speaker. I trust that
                the Speaker will get a sense of Members’ feelings and of the
                stamina of the Minister who must respond at the end of it all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That being the case, there will not be a
                specific time limit on Members’ interventions. We shall debate
                until 1.30 pm, suspend from 1.30 pm to 2.30 pm for lunch and
                resume at 2.30 pm with Question Time until 4.00 pm. We shall
                then resume the Budget debate and continue until its completion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have, however, been asked by the business

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much will be said in the early part of the

                stay to listen to all those who speak at the earlier stage so
                that their interventions are not repetitious. I shall, in
                deference to the House and in particular to the business
                managers, pay particular attention as the debate continues to

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly approves the programme of
                expenditure proposals for 2001-02 as set out in the Budget laid
                before the Assembly on 12 December 2000.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today the Assembly will vote for the first
                time on a budget as envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement.
                Guided by the Programme for Government, the Executive have
                agreed their programme of expenditure proposals for 2001-02 and
                have made some revisions as a result of scrutiny by the Assembly
                and its Committees. We had less time for the procedure than we
                wished, but now is the time to take the next important step. It
                is my privilege, on behalf of the Executive, to ask the Assembly
                to approve the proposals that I introduced last week.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Approving the Budget is one of the Assembly’s
                most important responsibilities. It is essential that, after
                mature debate, we discharge that responsibility on behalf of all
                our people. This will be our biggest step in moving away from
                the patterns that we inherited a year ago. From today we shall
                be setting a new direction and providing resources for public
                services under the guidance and management of the new
                institutions; services that will be guided by our programmes and
                priorities and not by anyone else’s.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive have set out their objectives
                in the draft Programme for Government, and the Budget
                allocations have been framed with these objectives in mind. We
                intend to make a difference, and this Budget will make that
                difference to the lives of thousands of our people. We have made
                extensive provision for the key services upon which we all
                depend. We have available a total increase in spending that
                allows for likely inflation of 5%. That is a real opportunity to
                do more and to make real improvements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am determined to avoid hype today because I
                recognise that we must deal with spending issues realistically.
                We must, however, make the most of the significant additional
                money that we have to spend, comparing this year with next. I
                can cite a few examples of how we intend to make the most of
                that money. We have made significant new provision for student
                support and for the introduction of free travel for the elderly.
                We have made provision for safer railways and new trains — at
                last. As a result of the spending plans more money will be spent
                on the Health Service to tackle pressing needs and problems. We
                are investing more in our schools and further education
                colleges, in buildings and, more importantly, in staff, because
                it is our priority to raise standards in education. There are
                significant increases in the budgets for agriculture, the
                environment and social development. These will fulfil the needs
                of key services and will also provide significant employment;
                they will help too in delivering these services. The Executive’s
                proposals are designed to make improvements in all spending
                programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have also struck out in new directions,
                most visibly through the creation of the five Executive
                programme funds. It has been argued that these funds have merely
                delayed the allocation of money to Departments. That is to miss
                the point. We are determined to break with the past practice of
                paying lip service to co-operation between Departments. The
                funds will play a key role in ensuring genuine co-operation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every budget must strike a balance between
                the desirable and the affordable, and the Executive have worked
                hard to achieve such a balance. A significant real increase in
                spending will enable us to provide many positive measures and to
                make some inroads into our inherited problems. However, our
                needs are so extensive that we cannot deal with all the problems
                and backlogs at once. The Executive formed a judgement on this
                balance. We believe that it achieves funding for some key
                actions that we regard as priorities and that it offers good
                provision for all the key services for which the Assembly is
                responsible.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last year I said that setting a budget would
                entail change for us all. We would no longer be advocates for
                one issue, or for one issue at a time, but would have to judge
                all the issues. That is clear from today’s discussion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to tell the Assembly that
                Commissioner Barnier has today signed the European Union
                community support framework. That is another important step
                towards completing work on the new programmes. We are very
                grateful to the European Union for the special support that it
                has provided. The Peace II programme is a unique and tangible
                commitment by the European Union to underpin the Good Friday
                Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I introduced the draft Budget in October
                I promised that the Executive would listen carefully to the
                points that emerged from the scrutiny of these proposals in the
                Assembly and in the wider community. The revised Budget is proof
                that this promise has been kept. We have strengthened spending
                in many important areas. Of course, we have not been able to do
                everything that was asked — there are simply insufficient
                resources for that. Nor must we imagine that new services come
                without cost. If we wish to do more we must will the means to do
                more. That is why the Executive have kept the proposed increase
                in the regional rate, unpopular though that may be. Many Members
                have said repeatedly that we face hard choices, and this is one
                from which the Executive have not shied. Raising extra money
                from the regional rate — from those who can afford to
                contribute to our services — is necessary to deliver the
                improvements in public services that we all need and want.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I look forward to a vigorous, but
                responsible, debate on the Budget. That is what the voters who
                sent us here want and what democracy demands. When the
                allocations have been set, key procedures of the Executive and
                the Assembly for controlling spending will be brought into
                operation. They are designed to ensure that the money is used as
                effectively as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to stress again how strongly we are
                determined to achieve progress by working with the relevant
                Committees and by taking account of all the points raised by
                Members. Mr Speaker, I commend this Budget to the Assembly.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Peter Robinson and I move the amendment on
                behalf of our party.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened very carefully — as did, I am
                sure, all Members — to the Minister’s latest statement; I
                have listened carefully in recent weeks to several of his
                statements in the House and in Committees. We are all agreed, as
                no doubt are all those who have seen the Finance and Personnel
                Committee’s report on the Budget process, that we have not
                been given enough time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This must be corrected. I welcome the
                Minister’s assurance that in future (if the Assembly has a
                future) more time will be devoted to this important aspect of
                expenditure and government. It is unacceptable that Members
                should be presented with over £6 billion of expenditure in
                important areas in all Departments and be expected to
                deliberate, consult and decide on it in so short a time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We complained in the past about direct rule
                Ministers’ lack of consultation. In future, it will be
                unacceptable for the Minister to introduce budgets in the same
                way as this year’s and for the reasons that he gave.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the Minister to do what he can in
                conjunction with Her Majesty’s Treasury to ensure that the
                calculation of the Barnett formula is changed. I know that he is
                considering this and that there is a problem with how the
                Barnett formula is calculated — it does not meet the needs of
                this part of the United Kingdom. An adjustment to it would help
                to provide extra expenditure to meet many of the needs
                identified by the various Assembly Committees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Departmental running costs are highlighted in
                the Finance and Personnel Committee’s report. The Minister
                will be aware that the Confederation of British Industry and
                Assembly Members have highlighted the large increases in
                departmental running costs between 2000-01 and 2001-02. This
                increase in bureaucracy and administration could be pruned to
                ensure that more money is spent on capital and on delivering
                services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that this issue will be dealt with in
                future and I am confident that, without even waiting until next
                year, some Ministers are already looking for ways to prune
                expenditure so that services can be improved. Of course, we must
                bear in mind that there has been an increase in administration
                under this system of government, and the Minister drew the
                Committee’s attention to this. The need to increase the number
                of Departments from six to 10 has resulted in departmental
                running costs of £26·1&nbsp;million for this financial year
                and the same again for next year. Over £52&nbsp;million is
                being spent simply to accommodate 10&nbsp;Departments rather
                than six. At the time, many of us pointed out that some of the
                departmental divisions were not being made for practical,
                pragmatic reasons but rather to ensure that there were enough
                jobs for the boys and girls and to cover the various party
                political considerations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This £52&nbsp;million of taxpayers’ money,
                which could have been spent on delivering services, is being
                spent on administration, bureaucracy and red tape. Over a year
                and a half ago, leading members of the Ulster Unionist Party
                promised us that reduced spending on quangos and on other public
                bodies would create enormous savings that would compensate for
                the increased expenditure on administration. We have yet to see
                those enormous savings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A review of public administration and of
                Departments has been announced. However, that announcement was
                not made to the House. We have no details of what the review
                will comprise, because, despite repeated requests, the Minister
                has never told the House what implications it will have. We
                learned of it in newspaper reports and at press conferences, but
                Members have yet to hear details of the review so that it can be
                subject to questions and debate. The sooner that is done the
                better.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall now deal with the subject matter of
                our amendment. Throughout the questions after the Minister
                presented the Budget, after he presented the revised Budget, and
                again during the debate on the Budget itself, we heard heated
                argument. The Minister has clearly heard the widespread concern
                in the community — concern that has been echoed in the House
                — at the scale of the increase in the regional rate proposed
                by him and by the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that Sinn Féin is also to move an
                amendment to reduce the regional rate. I am very interested to
                know whether Sinn Féin agreed to the increase in the regional
                rate and to the allocation to the Executive programme funds when
                these were being debated in the Executive. We did not. We come
                to this House with clean hands, so we have every right to move
                such an amendment. However, I want to hear from the Minister
                exactly where Sinn Féin stands on the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rates issue proves that the notion of
                collective responsibility in this system of government is what
                we have always said it is — a notion. It does not exist. Every
                Minister does his or her own thing, and if anyone needs more
                evidence of that let him look at today’s proceedings on a key
                issue of government. We heard from the Minister that the Budget
                is a milestone, a major step forward for the Assembly.
                Nevertheless, one of the parties in the Executive is to move an
                amendment to change fundamentally the Budget that it agreed with
                the other members of the Executive. Other parties certainly have
                some explaining to do when they attack us. After all, we do not
                go to the Executive; our hands are clean on this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that the fact that his
                promises had been kept was proof that he had listened very
                carefully to Members. He also said that these are our priorities
                and no one else’s. Clearly, he takes full responsibility for
                the 8% rise in the regional rate. The parties that support him
                on this also take full responsibility. Responsibility for that
                decision lies with no one else.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last year the Minister said that he had
                decided to roll forward the uplift of 8% in the domestic
                regional rate that was assumed in the 1998 comprehensive
                spending review. At that time, it was generally accepted that
                there was very little time available and very little room for
                introducing radical change into any aspect of the Budget. For
                that reason, the Budget went through an accelerated procedure
                without any amendments being made to inherited policy. However,
                it was strongly suggested that in this financial year there
                would be an opportunity to make changes. In fact, on 17 October
                Mr Durkan reminded the House that his proposals were</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;not a set of hand-me-down Budget
                proposals simply rolling forward the plans inherited from the
                period of direct rule&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That may be largely true, but not with regard
                to the regional rate. The 8% increase is precisely the increase
                that direct rule Ministers had planned; and precisely the
                increase that was implemented by direct rule Ministers in the
                previous two years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These increases were bitterly criticised by
                many elected representatives, especially those in local councils
                throughout the Province, who have struggled to keep the district
                rate increases as close as possible to the rate of inflation.
                They saw their hard work cast aside when direct rule Ministers
                imposed swingeing increases far above the rate of inflation.
                Nonetheless, the Minister and the parties that support him in
                the Executive are introducing another swingeing increase that
                will add enormously to ratepayers’ household bills.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rates apply to all whether they are on high,
                middle or low incomes; rates are not a progressive form of
                taxation. People who are struggling to make ends meet and people
                who are working to earn an income for their families will be hit
                year after year with massive increases in their rates bills. We
                have had these increases for the last two years. On page 3,
                paragraph 1.9 of the Budget statement one finds that this is not
                the end of the story. The Minister says that the spending
                proposals in the draft Budget require the domestic regional rate
                to be increased by 8% and the non-domestic regional rate by
                6·6% in 2001-02. The Executive have confirmed these proposals
                for 2001-02, and I am interested to know whether all members of
                the Executive were in agreement, given Sinn Féin’s amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The spending plans should make people across
                Northern Ireland sit up and take notice. For years we are to
                have an increase of 8%. For 2001-02 it is proposed to have an
                increase at more than twice the rate of inflation; and the
                spending plans for 2002-03 and 2003-04 require the domestic
                regional rate to be increased by — guess what? — 8% and the
                non-domestic regional rate by 5·5% in both years. If Mr Durkan
                and those parties that support him in the Executive have their
                way, ratepayers in Northern Ireland, whether they are on high,
                middle or low incomes, will face a rates increase of 8% every
                year for five years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is this acceptable? We recently had a debate
                in the House on increases in electricity prices, after Northern
                Ireland Electricity imposed an increase of 8%. Outrage, concern
                and alarm were expressed on all sides of the House at this
                increase, as it will result in consumers in Northern Ireland
                paying the highest electricity prices not just in the United
                Kingdom but in Europe. Nevertheless, the Minister comes here
                today on behalf of those parties that support him in the
                Executive to lay before the House a proposal that would increase
                the regional rate by an inflation-busting 8%. This is on top of
                what has already been done — and there are more plans in the
                pipeline.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is simply unacceptable. Numerous studies
                have shown that people in Northern Ireland are generally less
                well off than people in other parts of the United Kingdom and
                that the gross weekly income in Northern Ireland is £100 less
                than the UK average. I did not hear that argument from the
                Minister. His only justification was that the proposed
                expenditure cannot be maintained if we do not set the rates
                increase at 8%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That goes without saying. However, the
                question remains: why has he picked 8%? Is it a coincidence that
                that figure was proposed and implemented by direct rule
                Ministers? No doubt the Minister will argue that we are slightly
                better off than council taxpayers across the water. However, I
                have already pointed out that we in Northern Ireland pay
                disproportionately higher costs for many services and essential
                goods than people in the rest of the United Kingdom do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at other issues. Northern Irish
                people pay more for fuel and transport than those in the rest of
                the UK and in the South, yet the Minister wants to add a massive
                increase in the regional rate to that burden. He is to some
                extent correct in saying that if we were to stick to the
                expenditure proposals in his Budget, he would have to increase
                the regional rate by 8%. Our amendment suggests a way in which
                he could obtain the necessary finance. In correspondence with
                the Finance and Personnel Committee, officials explained that if
                the increase in the regional rate were kept at 4%, revenue would
                be reduced by £8·9&nbsp;million. If the increase were 6%,
                revenue would be reduced by £4·4&nbsp;million. We have
                calculated that at a rate of inflation of 2·9% we would have to
                find approximately £12&nbsp;million to reduce the increase in
                the regional rate from the proposed inflation-busting 8% to what
                I regard as a reasonable rate of increase — the rate of
                inflation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore we suggest that this money can be
                found by looking at the expenditure for the all-Ireland
                political dimension contained in Mr Durkan’s Budget. The
                increases outlined in his Budget are quite significant. For
                instance, the increase for the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish
                Lights Commission is from £400,000 to £600,000, an increase of
                almost 50%. The increase for the North/South language body is
                from £2·2&nbsp;million to over £3·5&nbsp;million, an
                increase of over 50%. Expenditure for Waterways Ireland rises
                from £1·3&nbsp;million to £2·6&nbsp;million, an increase of
                exactly 100%. Some £2·9&nbsp;million is being spent on the
                trade and business development body, which was not originally
                included in the list of North/South implementation bodies. The
                money for the special EU programmes body rises from £300,000 to
                £600,000, an increase of 100%. Expenditure for the Food Safety
                Promotion Board rises by 50%, from £1&nbsp;million to
                £1·5&nbsp;million. In all, the total is £11·7&nbsp;million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tourism, which was included by the Department
                and by the Minister in the list of North/South implementation
                bodies last year, has for some reason been omitted from this
                year’s list. Perhaps because its expenditure has risen from
                £0·5&nbsp;million to £5·8&nbsp;million. Therefore total
                expenditure when the secretariat costs of the North/South
                Ministerial Council have been included — and they come to well
                over £600,000 — approaches £20&nbsp;million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the costs of the Civic Forum and the
                various other items designed to promote the political agenda of
                the Belfast Agreement are added, one can see where savings could
                be made. We have heard eloquent speeches from Members who
                believe that the regional rate should be reduced. Despite their
                eloquence, passion and argument, however, they failed to move an
                amendment. No doubt they will be pleased to support this
                amendment. I do not look in any particular direction when I say
                that, although I do look forward to hearing Mr Close.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In an attempt to pre-empt this argument, Mr
                Durkan said last week that none of the expenditure on
                North/South bodies and on the all-Ireland political dimension is
                new spending; that some of it had already occurred. I see that
                the First Minister has suddenly sprung to life and is nodding
                vigorously. Our amendment states that the expenditure should be
                taken from these bodies and put back into the pockets of
                Northern Ireland’s ratepayers. Essential work that is already
                under way should continue. That will be a matter for
                consideration for the Minister and for the Executive. However,
                if the Minister is trying to tell us that this will end work
                that is already going on, he is not speaking with any validity.
                Our amendment allows that necessary work to continue, while
                stripping away an all-Ireland dimension that was designed to
                promote a political agenda.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that the Minister — as the First
                Minster and others have tried to do — will say that in a
                budget of £6 billion the amount of money that we are discussing
                is very small; that it does not amount to much. They dismiss it
                as almost trivial. However, when we look for extra money to pay
                for essential services in various Departments we are told that
                hardly another penny can be squeezed out of the system. I remind
                the House that for every £1 million spent on advancing the
                all-Ireland political dimension of the Belfast Agreement, less
                money is returned to people through reductions in the regional
                rate. For every £1 million spent there are 200 fewer heart
                operations in Northern Ireland; 25 fewer homes built for the
                homeless; 300 fewer people with central heating in their homes;
                and 1,000 fewer adaptations are carried out in homes so that
                people with disabilities can live comfortably in the community.
                That is what we get for every £1 million. Think what the
                statistics would be if that were multiplied by the almost £20
                million being spent to advance the political agenda of the
                all-Ireland &quot;North/Southery&quot; of the Belfast Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Others will want, no doubt, to add to and
                comment on what I have said. However, I want to commend this
                amendment to the House. Other aspects of the Budget concern us,
                and we shall raise them later in the debate. Members who
                genuinely desire to ensure that the people of Northern Ireland
                are not penalised on top of the already high fuel and transport
                costs and the high and rising electricity and food costs can say
                to them today &quot;We shall not penalise you further by raising
                your rates above the rate of inflation&quot;. Join with us in
                the Democratic Unionist Party in voting to have those rates
                reduced and in putting a stop to the North/South all-Ireland
                aspect of this Budget.</p>

                beg to move the following amendment: At the end, add</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;subject to a reduction of expenditure,

                increase in the regional rate from 8% to the current level of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nigel Dodds claimed that his party’s hands
                were clean; the truth is that its hands are wringing wet. Of
                course the DUP members of the Executive do not take their seats.
                However, after their Ministers have tried to get what they need
                for their Departments — and rightly so, for they represent
                everyone in the region not just their own party support —
                their Colleagues come here to attack everyone else. The Member
                for North Belfast, Mr Dodds, made a blatantly political speech
                that had nothing to do with the Budget, concentrating instead on
                the North/South Ministerial Council. That is a matter for the
                DUP, but I hope that this will expose the truth to everyone.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP said nothing constructive. It says
                that we should remove everything from the North/South
                Ministerial Council, offering all the old chestnuts about
                cutting back on Government expenditure. However, it fails to
                suggest anything that might pass for a reasonable proposal.
                There is no acknowledgement that their Departments made
                considerable bids for funding for other projects; bids that they
                were unable to secure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I move the amendment reluctantly, and it is
                with even greater reluctance that I suggest that the money be
                taken from the Executive programme funds. We regard it as a
                one-off means — for this year only — of reducing the rates
                increase. We are conscious that every Department made
                considerable bids for funding for much needed programmes that
                would benefit the whole community. We see the Executive
                programme funds as a means of drawing off money that has not yet
                been committed. I acknowledge that we could overload the
                programme funds so I move the amendment with great reluctance
                and stress that the measure should be for this year only.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister readily acknowledged that
                circumstances beyond our control have ensured once again that we
                have only a relatively short time in which to scrutinise the
                Budget. My party appreciates the efforts of all the Ministers
                who have grappled daily with their departmental responsibilities
                while seeking to work together for the benefit of all
                Departments and all citizens. That important achievement should
                be welcomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall answer the question put by Nigel
                Dodds. My Colleagues were prepared to support the Budget in its
                entirety, including the rates increase; Martin McGuinness and
                Bairbre de Brún were very supportive of the whole Budget.
                However, after wider consultation and consideration, our party
                finds itself unable to support an increase above the rate of
                inflation; that is reasonable. Despite the DUP’s jibes, the
                Executive will not collapse because the parties that worked on
                the Budget have differences of opinion. I must therefore
                disappoint the DUP: any party in the Executive can hold a
                position that is contrary to that of others without causing a
                collapse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week I welcomed the statement from the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel. He identified the consistent
                underfunding and neglect on the part of previous
                Administrations. British Ministers, who had no mandate here,
                flew in and out, setting Budgets unaccountably and producing
                inadequate and often discriminatory funding packages. Last week
                the Minister acknowledged the problem caused by deficient
                spending over the years and the inadequacy of the Barnett
                formula. I welcomed his comments; they once again made it clear
                that the Executive must vigorously pursue the question of how we
                are funded under the Barnett formula.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members who have worked on councils will
                understand why the regional rate increase was inserted into the
                Budget: it was an attempt to match all Departments’ funding
                demands. However, after consideration, it is our view that such
                an increase would be an unfair burden on some sectors in the
                community, particularly the retail sector. There is no doubt
                that the massive hike in the rates in recent years has been very
                damaging to small businesses. That is why we do not want to
                support a rates increase above the rate of inflation this year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We take the view that such an increase
                conflicts with the commitments that many of us have, including
                all the members of the Executive, to support the arterial
                routes, small villages, rural communities and small businesses.
                We must remind ourselves that the Minister has already committed
                himself to conducting a further rates review. This move would be
                precipitous at present and damaging to small businesses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We move the amendment reluctantly. We want to
                acknowledge publicly the Trojan efforts of Executive Ministers
                — those of them who work together — in squaring the circle
                of meeting funding demands. We all appreciate that it has been a
                very difficult task. In that spirit, I want to move the
                amendment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may be of some assistance to the House if
                I remind Members that under section 64(2) of the Northern
                Ireland Act 1998 votes on the draft Budget require
                cross-community support. I simply draw that to the attention of
                the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Finance and Personnel
                Committee (Mr Molloy):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                welcome the Minister of Finance and Personnel’s statement and
                praise the work that he has done in very difficult
                circumstances. We all know that it is the Minister that carries
                the can for the Budget when all is said and done. It is the
                Executive’s Budget — not just the Minister’s. There may be
                parts of it with which he disagrees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has been very open with the
                Finance and Personnel Committee on all its requests for
                information. He is committed to ensuring that the Budget is
                representative of and committed to the various Departments; and
                to ensuring that it reflects as far as possible the views of the
                Finance and Personnel Committee. The Minister serves two
                Committees — the Executive Committee and the Finance and
                Personnel Committee — and that must be difficult, particularly
                if he also has his own views.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Finance and Personnel Committee sought
                views from all the departmental Committees on the provision for
                their respective Departments. All but two of them responded. It
                is important to say that there is collective responsibility on
                departmental Committees to work together in scrutinising the
                Budget in every possible way and in ensuring that the Finance
                and Personnel Committee produces a full report to advise the
                Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Finance and Personnel Committee arranged
                the substantive Budget debate, held on 14 November, during which
                Members had full opportunity to raise concerns about the
                allocations in the Budget proposals. After the debate, the
                Committee produced a report that summarised the written
                responses and the Budget debate. The report was passed to the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel on Friday 24 November, and a
                published version was available to Members a week later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report recommended that the Programme for
                Government and the Budget proposals should be among the first
                items of business brought to the Assembly by the Executive after
                the summer recess. This is important. Everybody has complained
                about not having had enough time to deal with the Budget or to
                scrutinise it properly. To rectify that, the programme should be
                introduced immediately after the summer recess. The Minister has
                acknowledged that this will be the target to work towards in
                future, and it is important that we reach that target.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An assessment of needs should be undertaken
                as a first step in demonstrating that the current application of
                the Barnett formula is inappropriate and unsuited to the special
                circumstances here. The Minister acknowledged last week that the
                Barnett formula does not target the social need that we are
                trying to deal with. It is not appropriate here. However, as he
                warned, it is also dangerous to throw the baby out with the bath
                water. We must look at what may be possible in the future and,
                to that end, the Finance and Personnel Committee asks the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel, the Executive and the
                Assembly to develop a strategy to review the Barnett formula. It
                is not &quot;the Barnett formula or nothing&quot;. There must be
                a mechanism. We would like to join with the Executive and with
                the other Committees to develop a strategy whereby we can
                approach the British Exchequer to ensure that we get a proper
                appropriation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department should commission an urgent
                review of the structure and staffing of all Departments and the
                bodies for which they are responsible in order to achieve
                maximum efficiency in delivering public services in 2001-02.
                Although he did not fully commit himself, the Minister did
                respond. However, the restrictions on Departments and on budgets
                are essential to ensure that every penny of public money is used
                to maximum advantage. We ask for reassurance that the question
                of efficiency across all public services will be dealt with
                urgently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister should assess the departmental
                financial allocations in order to take full account of the
                objectives contained in the Programme for Government. Ministers
                consider the objectives, the requirements of new TSN and public
                safety to be of the utmost importance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be a warm welcome for the
                additional money that the Minister put forward last week.
                Whoever delivers a Budget always says that no more money is
                available. However, we saw last week that more moneys were
                available. An extra £40 million was found through a review of
                how the Government deal with VAT returns. That review increased
                our spending power by £20 million. That must be welcomed,
                because several Departments benefited. There was an extra £7
                million for health, £2 million for agriculture, £2 million for
                housing, £2 million for roads, and £1·3 million for
                education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must ensure that European funding is
                additional to the Budget, although there was a response with
                regard to additionality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every Department needs more money, and I am
                sure that none of the Committees will say that it has achieved
                all that it wanted. However, it is a major step forward, and we
                look forward to considering all of this again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Finance and Personnel Committee did not
                adopt a position with regard to the 8% regional rate rise. Had a
                vote been taken during the meetings and discussions, the
                Committee would have opposed the rise. It is important to note
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Departments should consult their
                Committees during the spring and early summer before finalising
                their budgetary requirements and submitting them for the
                consideration of the Minister of Finance and Personnel. It is
                important that all Ministers relate to their Committees to
                ensure inclusive discussions so that the Budget reflects as far
                as possible the requirements of Committees and Ministers.
                Ministers should regard Committees as a support, and Committees
                must be aware of what their Ministers demand from the Executive
                and must support them in those demands.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are the Committees’ concerns; Members
                may raise others. In a personal and political role and speaking
                as a party member and as a constituency representative, I feel
                that it is important to recognise the work done by the Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a pity that the Assembly’s first
                Budget contains a proposal to raise the domestic regional rate
                by 8% and the non-domestic rate by 6·6%. The rates are an
                unfair system of taxation. A taxation system should be called a
                tax and not simply put on the rates. The rating system is a
                blunt instrument for collecting tax, because it hits households.
                It becomes a poll tax. We remember the poll tax campaign in
                England. Young people were forced off the electoral register
                because parents were losing housing benefit, and various
                structures had to be put in place to counteract that. The rates
                should be viewed as another poll tax that damages the whole
                community. We want young people to be involved in political
                structures: forcing them off the register will not encourage
                them.</p>
                <i>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The blunt nature of the rating system means
                that households are targeted rather than individuals. At least
                taxation across the board means that although taxpayers must pay
                a higher rate of tax, they can do so because they are earning.
                The Minister said that the rates rise would be directed at those
                who can afford to pay, but that is not the case. Many on the
                breadline will be pushed one way or another, and the rates rise
                will drive many small shops out of business. In some small towns
                and villages the rise in rates will lead to the closure of rural
                businesses. That is particularly important given the state of
                agriculture. The Executive and the Minister of Agriculture have
                told the House that a rural approach is needed. The situation
                will not be helped if small rural businesses close. In future,
                many households, particularly in rural areas, will be deprived.
                The rates rise will add to already high expenses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will say that rates are lower
                here than in England, Scotland and Wales. However, the rates,
                especially the council rate, are different here because the
                situation is completely different. Councils in England, Scotland
                and Wales provide a full range of services; in some cases more
                services than the Assembly does. He is not comparing like with
                like.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that we shall be asked where the
                money will come from if the rates are not raised. As I said
                earlier, the VAT review has put an extra £40 million into the
                coffers. Even with last week’s additions, there is a
                difference of over £20 million. The amendment moved in the name
                of Mr Alex Maskey identifies that very clearly. Last week, an
                additional £9 million was put into the Executive programme
                funds. That, and the moneys in the Executive fund that have not
                been allocated to a Department, could be used to alleviate the
                rise in rates. We do not want to wipe the rates out; we merely
                want keep them in line with inflation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members have already covered part of the
                8% rise in the regional rate that will raise an additional £12
                million. The Executive have made too much of this figure and of
                raising the rates in this manner. The rating system is a blunt
                instrument for collecting taxes, and it should be re-examined.
                We do not have a balance sheet that sets out the consequences of
                not doing it or that explains why the domestic rates are rising
                by 8% and the non-domestic rates by 6·6%. We are told that this
                will also apply next year. Another 8% rise in the rates in
                twelve months’ time will cripple rural communities. We must
                look at that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are also asking those who were deprived of
                services and facilities in the past to pay again. The British
                exchequer underfunded infrastructure here for years. Those who
                were deprived, especially those west of the Bann who have no
                hospitals, services or infrastructure, are being asked to pay an
                8% rise along with everyone else. We are punishing those who
                were punished in the past, and that is unfair.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need a strategy for dealing with the
                Barnett formula. It is simply not good enough to say that the
                Barnett formula does not work and that we must deal with it. We
                need a strategy developed by the Executive, the Assembly and its
                Members to lobby the British Exchequer to ensure that more money
                is available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, we must lobby the British Exchequer
                for the peace money that we were promised would come from
                reductions in spending on security, the military and on
                policing. All that money should be available for other services.
                For years we were told that that was depriving people of
                services. The British Exchequer must turn the war chest into a
                &quot;peace chest&quot; to ensure that this money reaches the
                right places.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Irish Government must pay towards their
                aspirations, because it is important — this is, after all, a
                transition period — to ask the Irish Government to pay into
                the Exchequer so that the Assembly receives money from them.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that the Member’s party seems to have
                a direct line to the Irish Government, I wonder whether that
                suggestion has been made to them. How did they react when he
                suggested that they should &quot;pay towards their
                aspirations&quot;?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Cheann Comhairle, my party has put the
                point several times, and the Irish Government have responded.
                They have funded projects here that the British Government
                failed to pay for — for instance, Irish-medium schools and
                various cultural events that the British Government and the
                Unionist Party failed to recognise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should certainly ask the Irish Government
                to spread the Celtic Tiger right across the 32&nbsp;counties of
                Ireland. Let them follow aspirations with commitment and
                finance. We shall certainly push that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall deal with some of the specific issues
                and, for a moment, be a bit more parochial. Although the
                increase in money to the various Departments is welcome, more is
                needed. There should be an allocation for the acute services
                review, for instance. The review may shock us all by trying to
                reverse the imbalance in the hospital service between east and
                west of the Bann. If the South Tyrone Hospital is to reopen as
                an acute hospital, money will be needed. But from where? We must
                ensure that that happens.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the acute services review is simply a
                whitewash it will have been a waste of time and money. I would
                like to see money allocated in the Budget. The British
                Government should be asked to pay. For years the Conservative
                Government — propped up by the Unionist Party — made cuts,
                closed hospitals and reduced services. It is now time for
                payback, and the British Government should correct the imbalance
                of the past to ensure that they live up to their commitments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same holds for infrastructure, for rail
                and road services east and west of the Bann and for agriculture.
                We must ensure that there are services for rural communities. We
                must pay for those services, but we must also see a rebalancing
                of the finances that have been going east rather than west of
                the Bann in recent years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are candid in saying that the British
                Government must invest here to correct that imbalance. Their
                past neglect caused it, and through investment they must ensure
                that it never happens again. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment Committee (Dr Birnie):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is worth reiterating that this is an
                historic occasion. It is the first Budget and the first
                Programme for Government for Northern Ireland and by Northern
                Ireland people in almost three decades. In forming any Budget
                there is a danger that departmental inertia and political
                expediency will mean that we just roll forward existing
                allocations willy-nilly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That said, this Budget contains valuable
                innovations and has resisted the danger of inertia and
                expediency. Three main innovations are to be welcomed. First,
                the Executive programme funds will ensure that our assent to the
                principle of joined-up Government is not nominal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the first time, public service agreements
                will be applied from London to public expenditure in Northern
                Ireland. Properly applied and scrutinised, they should ensure
                value for money. Today we are simply discussing cash inputs, but
                ultimately the public values what that money pays for and the
                good services that it delivers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third innovation in the Budget is solid
                investment in areas that could be foundations for future
                economic growth and social progress. Therefore I wish to return
                to the extra provision in last week’s statement and in the
                statement of the Minister of Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment last Friday regarding student support.
                This is the first time that Members have been able to consider
                those provisions in detail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Higher and Further Education, Training
                and Employment Committee welcomes them as a good start to a
                continuing process of reform. Let us be clear about the central
                problem of student support. Lower-income social classes in
                Northern Ireland are approximately three fifths of the adult
                population; but they constitute barely a quarter of students in
                higher education. We must ensure that people of genuine ability
                do not miss out on a good education and on the chance of
                developing their potential because their families cannot afford
                to maintain them in further or higher education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, there are many benefits in the
                extra support for students. Last week’s package goes some way
                towards the proposals in the Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment Committee’s report on the subject. It
                is hoped that there will be some grants, some removal of student
                tuition fees and some additional university and further
                education places in Northern Ireland. That may be seen as a
                clever piece of social inclusion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is still room in the Budget, as money
                becomes available through in-year monitoring, for necessary
                social inclusion spending from other Departments to help other
                socially disadvantaged groups apart from students. As ever, the
                devil will be in the detail of the students’ support package.
                The Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment
                Committee welcomes the ending of tuition fees for some further
                education courses — especially those dealing with perceived
                skills shortages — the Minister’s proposals may be open to
                challenge down the line owing to the perceived inequity and
                selectivity of support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Dr Farren that skills shortages
                are an important, cross-cutting matter that should be dealt
                with. They will have implications for the Department of
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment, among others. Innovative
                policy should not be restrained by a straightjacket of excessive
                equality regulations. At the same time, since that Department
                has hitherto made so much of equality proofing, there is a
                danger of its being hoist by its own petard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week the Minister of Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment decided that the principle of
                tuition fees should be retained. I understand the logic of his
                argument. Nevertheless, there is solid evidence from England
                that the fees that students in higher and further education must
                pay may deter those from low-income backgrounds from studying.
                If the Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and
                Employment intends to keep fees for students from a higher
                income background, it should improve the information available
                so that it is clear that less than half of students will be
                paying part or full fees.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, the House may have to return
                to the question of tuition fees in further and higher education
                in two or three years’ time. After the next general election
                the new Government may back the Russell Group proposal by the
                perceived elite of English and Scottish universities that we
                move towards the American system of very high top-up fees for
                university students.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We shall cross that bridge if we come to it.
                For the time being, however, the Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment proposals are a good start. They would
                give Northern&nbsp;Ireland a system of student support superior
                to England’s — particularly in further education —
                although probably less developed than the support available in
                Scotland. We do not yet know what will happen in Wales.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At least we can be satisfied that, in this
                area, devolution is making a valuable difference for all the
                people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland. I therefore support the motion
                and reject the two amendments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Maskey and Mr&nbsp;Molloy commented
                on the rates burden on business. We should be thankful that this
                could be evidence that Sinn&nbsp;Féin is at last throwing off
                Marx — Karl, not Groucho — and that there is evidence of a
                conversion towards the enterprise culture. That should be
                applauded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the DUP’s amendment, it is
                of note that the six North/South implementation bodies employ
                about 300&nbsp;people in Northern&nbsp;Ireland: more than
                20,000&nbsp;are employed in the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Civil
                Service. That puts the implementation bodies into perspective.
                Most of those 300&nbsp;people have been transferred from
                existing departmental activities. These activities would have
                happened anyway, and we would still have had to pay for them.
                Among these activities are the maintenance of canals and river
                banks and the upkeep of lighthouses. Those instances of
                all-Ireland co-operation date back to the 1950s for canals and
                to the 1890s for lighthouses. That is hardly a formidable
                challenge to United&nbsp;Kingdom sovereignty. Of course, some
                Members regard Lord&nbsp;Brookeborough or the British Prime
                Minister, Lord Salisbury, as infamous Lundys. I support the
                motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is much to be commended in the Budget
                proposals. The Minister has shown insight and fairness in
                dealing with the difficult task of allocating funds to areas of
                need and social deprivation. I hope, as the Minister said, that
                we are at the start of a journey to redress the underfunding
                that is the legacy of the direct rule years and to set realistic
                targets to redress the balance and to target social need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very easy to advocate change when in
                opposition; it is not so easy, however, when one is in
                government. It is absurd for those who say that they want change
                and who are most vocal about the Executive programme now to
                oppose the mechanisms for change in the Budget. This is an
                Executive Budget, agreed collectively and implemented
                cross-departmentally. I appreciate that the Budget is not
                perfect, because needs will always outstrip the resources
                available. Nevertheless, the additional money available to
                schools, hospitals and agriculture is a testament to our
                intention to begin the process of change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also sure that our senior citizens are
                grateful for the increased provision for free transport. Do
                those who object to the increase in the rates want to see a
                reduction at the expense of the most marginalised sections of
                our population?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed overhaul of student finance
                cannot happen without additional funds. The proposals have
                already received support from Queen’s University Students’
                Union, the University of Ulster and the Belfast Institute of
                Further and Higher Education. Queen’s University Students’
                Union has stated its belief that Dr Farren has taken the first
                step towards striking the right balance. As a result of the
                changes almost three out of five students in higher education
                will pay no fees. The proposals must be seen for what they are
                — a positive move towards a more equitable distribution of
                funds that will promote wider access to education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The promotion of interdepartmental
                co-ordination in dealing with various issues, particularly those
                affecting people with disabilities, is one of the most positive
                measures. It offers a more concerted way to alleviate
                difficulties and to promote the social inclusion of one of the
                most disadvantaged sections of our population. We should aim at
                providing better access to services and facilities for the
                disabled to bring it into line with the access enjoyed by the
                rest of society. The combined effort across Departments will
                improve access for people with disabilities to culture and
                leisure facilities and to social and work activities. That is a
                positive move towards inclusion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An additional £1·3 million —7·2% — has
                been made available to education for 2001-02. The allocation for
                Northern Ireland, as for Scotland and Wales, is calculated using
                the Barnett formula, and the money goes into the block grant.
                The Barnett formula, which is based on population, awards only
                3·3%. That is a shortfall of £7 million compared to the extra
                funds allocated in England. I hope that the Barnett formula will
                be revised to ensure that the allocation of funding comes into
                line with that in England.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House is aware of the dreadful condition
                of schools. I welcome the extra moneys allocated to the
                improvement of schools, but it is only a drop in the ocean. It
                will take substantial investment to bring our schools —
                particularly our rural schools — up to modern standards. I
                hope that the Department will use some of the extra money for
                special needs provision and to improve literacy and numeracy,
                especially in schools in disadvantaged areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The targets defined in the Programme for
                Government must be regularly reviewed, and we must ensure that
                they are achievable. However, we cannot do anything without the
                adequate funding that will enable us to solve our problems.
                Funding for education is an investment in our future, and we
                must invest now, not merely to stop the system from
                deteriorating further but to develop a comprehensive and
                inclusive education system that will bring great benefits to our
                society now and in future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget is not perfect, but, as Dr Birnie
                said, we have, for the first time in three decades, the
                opportunity to make significant grass roots change in many
                disadvantaged areas. We should not remove additional funding
                that has already been allocated. If we did we would have to say
                to those who deserve help most &quot;Sorry, but we cannot do any
                more for you&quot;. Therefore I support the motion, not the
                amendments.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is difficult for the Minister to take
                account of the competing demands from Ministers and of the views
                of the Assembly Committees and still put forward a universally
                acceptable Budget. The Minister has allocated funds to
                Departments fairly and equitably based on the needs of the
                community rather than on the wants of Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Barnett formula has already been referred
                to, as has the subvention to Northern Ireland from the United
                Kingdom Exchequer. The House recognises that there must be a
                revision. Can the Minister tell us what type of revision is
                being sought and how it would be fairer to this part of the
                United Kingdom? Is there a strategy to allow us all to pursue a
                common goal?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this stage it is worth pointing out that
                as the Budget flows from the Programme for Government it is
                necessary to express some disappointment in that Programme for
                Government. I know that Ministers will not have had much
                opportunity to acquaint themselves with all the minutiae of
                their Departments or to start thinking about how things could be
                done differently. There was not much new in the Programme for
                Government, and some innovation is required to put the Ulster
                thumbprint on the operation of devolution in Northern Ireland.
                An outside observer would not notice much difference between
                this Executive’s Programme for Government and that of the
                direct rulers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members have expressed opinions on
                the amendments. I recognise that there is a responsibility —
                indeed a legal requirement — on an amendment to allow the
                Budget to be balanced at the end of the exercise. That places a
                responsibility on individuals and has restrained some who simply
                want to reduce the regional rate and forget about everything
                else rather than look at how easy it might be. That they have
                not moved an amendment may mean that they could not do it, and
                that balancing the Budget requires people to find out whether
                savings made here could be made elsewhere to balance it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had no difficulty in carrying out that
                exercise. We have known for several years that the whole process
                is politically driven and that a great deal of Budget money is
                squandered merely to bolster the Republican agenda. That is the
                core of our amendment. Dr Birnie does not think these issues
                very important. They are important enough for all the Executive
                parties to go to court, such is their significance. Their
                importance lies in where they intend to lead this Province.
                However, I am sure that the Deputy Speaker will not allow me to
                go much further down that road in a Budget debate.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Sir John Gorman] in the
                Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I found the Sinn Féin/IRA amendment amazing.
                They sat around the table shoulder to shoulder with the Minister
                of Finance and Personnel discussing how best to make the
                allocations. No doubt, those discussions took place over many
                months in the Executive.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.00</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that all those present argued
                persuasively for their Departments’ allocations and that they
                studied the whole Budget; and that after long discussions the
                Minister of Education and the Minister of Health agreed with the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel and with their Colleagues on
                what should be presented to the Assembly. However, as soon as
                that was done their party moved an amendment to the Budget that
                they had agreed. I find that incomprehensible. You may attack us
                for not being at the Executive and for moving an amendment, but
                had we agreed a Budget with you I assure you that we would have
                stood by you in the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must reach some conclusions. Clearly there
                is a split in IRA/Sinn Féin. That can be dangerous enough, as
                you are probably aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, but it is clear that
                the two Ministers are out of step with the rest of the party.
                The mover of their amendment said that the party had acted after
                further consideration. One might have thought that the
                &quot;further consideration&quot; would have taken place before
                they signed up to the Budget; but it appears that they do these
                things after the event. Having agreed to the proposals in the
                Budget, IRA/Sinn Féin decides that perhaps the electorate may
                not be so keen on a rates increase and so changes its mind.
                IRA/Sinn Féin is leading the Minister of Finance and Personnel
                to the end of the plank, and it will leave him there. Having
                stitched him up, it decides &quot;This is not good politics for
                us; we shall go in a different direction&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Either their two Ministers do not have the
                brains of the rest of the party — in which case one must
                wonder why they were proposed for office — or their party
                considers them dispensable in pursuit of its real objective:
                popularity with its electorate. Their approach to the agreements
                that they make does little credit to any principle they may
                claim.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget money required to keep the
                regional rate at the level of inflation is not significant.
                Therefore I am surprised that the Minister of Finance and
                Personnel could not accept the clear will of the Assembly and of
                the electorate to keep the regional rate at the level of
                inflation. The amount required for maintaining the regional rate
                at the level of inflation is much less than the amount that the
                Minister will have at the end of the financial year for
                slippage. Slippage will be about £40 million, or the
                &quot;reduced requirements of Departments&quot; as the
                Department of Finance and Personnel describes it. However, it is
                significantly more in each financial year than the amount that
                we are attempting to save. That puts it in perspective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to discuss several areas, and it will
                become clear why I have chosen them as I go on. The first is
                free fares. I am not sure what point Ms Lewsley was trying to
                make when she asked whether the people who moved these
                amendments wanted to deprive the needy of free fares. Obviously,
                she has not looked at the Order Paper. Neither amendment
                proposes taking money from free fares. Indeed, both of them look
                for funding from a different area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is worth pointing out that Sinn Féin/IRA
                said that it tabled its amendment because the Executive
                programme funds have not yet been allocated. Of course they have
                been allocated; they are on page five of the Executive Budget
                programme. They may not have been allocated down to the last
                detail, but neither are any of the other headings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will they take the money from community
                regeneration, service modernisation or infrastructure renewal to
                save the £12 million? Will it be taken from funding for
                children? Will it be taken out of the mouths of children? They
                should have been upfront, as we have been, in telling people
                where they would take the money from. It is not enough to say
                &quot;We shall take money from the Executive programme
                funds&quot;; one must tell people exactly where one intends to
                take the money from and what work will not be done as a result.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Assembly noted that the mover
                of the Sinn Féin/IRA amendment said that it was for this year
                only. He must want the regional rate to go up by 8% next year
                and by a further 8% the year after that, because that is what
                the indicative figures show. Our proposals will have life in
                them at the end of those 12 months and will be able to be
                carried forward into the following year, the year after and so
                on for ever. If that were the case, I would be happy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IRA/Sinn Féin amendment proposes taking
                money from areas of expenditure that are intended to put in
                place the very infrastructure that it demanded. IRA/Sinn Féin
                is attempting to bluff its constituents into believing that the
                money has been taken out of the pockets of the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister — the Executive programme funds.
                It would be taken from schemes that would benefit the
                constituents of every Member in the Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposal for free fares is strongly
                supported by the community, as has been shown in the ‘Belfast
                Telegraph’ opinion poll. I announced my intention to establish
                free fares for older people when I moved to the Department for
                Regional Development last year and I am delighted that we have
                taken a significant step towards them. The scheme has several
                advantages. Among them is the social interaction that will flow
                from it for people who are largely confined not because they are
                unable to go out or because they have no one to visit but
                because they must make the unpalatable choice between eating and
                outings. This scheme will give them greater freedom to be more
                involved in the community that they have done so much to
                support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it will only be of value to the
                whole community if there are improvements in transport,
                particularly in rural areas. When the test schemes were carried
                out in Castlereagh and in Newry and Mourne, I was struck by the
                difference between the two schemes. People in Newry and Mourne,
                where there is little rural transport, will derive less benefit
                from the scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore rather than say to Translink
                &quot;The scale of economy is such that you should be able to do
                something for us to reduce the amounts&quot;, we should be
                saying &quot;You must do something to improve rural services
                throughout Northern Ireland&quot;. I remember hearing Fermanagh
                councillors’ request for a bus service — never mind a better
                bus service — in their area. The benefits to Translink of free
                fares and the additional funding it will get must be paid back
                to the community, particularly the rural community. Further
                testing and phasing of the scheme may be necessary. That will be
                the joy of the Minister for Regional Development, but it will be
                necessary if we are to meet the time scales set out in the
                Minister’s statement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have twice attempted to get some
                clarification on the matter of roads. On both occasions the
                Minister was short of time. On the first occasion his statement
                in the Assembly limited his ability to respond; on the second in
                the Committee a whip was cracking in his ear and he had to come
                to the Assembly to speak in a debate. Now that he is in a more
                relaxed mood I hope that the Minister will be able to give me
                some answers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been speculation about roads
                programmes and the capital funding available to them. The
                reality is that the Minister has put enough money into roads for
                the capital resources required so that all the schemes that have
                been announced can proceed, provided that that level is
                maintained for the next two years. Forget about inflationary
                increases; if that level is maintained for the next two years
                all those schemes can proceed. However, as the Minister and
                House know, these schemes take a long time to go through the
                statutory processes. They must go through the necessary vesting
                orders and through the tendering and construction processes.
                That takes two or three years, and to start a job in year one
                the necessary resources must be available — albeit
                indicatively — in years two and three before the contract can
                be signed. A Minister cannot say &quot;On the basis of this
                year, I can proceed&quot;. A Minister must be sure that when he
                or she signs a contract the money will be available in years two
                and three.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a difficulty. The indicative figures
                show a reduction in the money that will be available for capital
                roads expenditure. That is shown, but it may not be the outcome
                because we have what are described as Executive programme funds.
                I listened to Dr Birnie extolling the Executive programme funds
                as I listened to the statement last week by the Minister of
                Finance and Personnel informing us of this great innovation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thought that all the funds in the Budget
                were for the Executive’s programme. What distinguishes these
                from others? Why have they been distinguished at all? We all
                know the reason. The First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister want to have some good news to announce from time to
                time. They want to take some of the good news away from
                Ministers — and they have attempted to do that frequently, as
                the Minister of Finance and Personnel will know — to announce
                it themselves — <i>[Interruption.]</p>

                have to fulfil commitments, and this will be done by the
                Departments. The Executive programme funds are simply a device
                to allow Ministers to announce some good news from time to time
                — although it could be something more sinister. It is to allow
                them to impose their political agenda on Departments and on the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here is where I have real difficulty. I shall
                take the example of the Department for Regional Development as I
                know it best. When deciding to spend money on roads, I cannot
                say &quot;I am the Member for East Belfast; East Belfast needs a
                new road around the harbour, so let us put our money in
                there&quot;. That would be entirely wrong. People might have
                done that in the past. However, one must have objective
                criteria; one must determine how one sets priorities. All
                Members think that the roads in their constituency should take
                priority, and I do not doubt their arguments, but we must have
                criteria when decisions are being made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In taking decisions on roads we should
                consider the number of accidents, the volume of traffic using
                the road, the benefits to major hospitals and to schools along
                the route and the age and state of repair of the road. These are
                all objective criteria in determining priorities. That is what
                we do. A Department will set the objective criteria and
                prioritise its programme on them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall take another example: the Toome
                bypass proposal was announced before the proposal for a road to
                Newry. As I expected, the Deputy First Minister argued the case
                with me for the Newry road in his constituency. I would have
                done exactly the same had I been Deputy First Minister.
                Objectively, however, I determined that the Toome bypass was
                more important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at the new circumstances.
                Infrastructure expenditure is now contained in the programme
                funds. Will the Deputy First Minister prevail on the Executive
                by telling them that &quot;Newry is the priority; its road must
                go ahead. We shall allocate the money out of the Executive
                programme funds&quot;? In that case, despite objective criteria,
                the less urgent road would be given precedence over the more
                urgent. That cannot be right. It may even be legally suspect.
                The basis on which the Executive programme funds are allocated
                should be questioned and clarified.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted that money is available for
                the improvements outlined by the railway task force in A D
                Little’s report — vital work for the railway infrastructure.
                There is now a draft regional development plan. An important
                part of transport strategy is to encourage people to use public
                transport. When devolution was introduced I had no doubt that
                the railways were finished; railways in Northern Ireland would
                close — with the exception, perhaps, of the Belfast to Dublin
                line. That was the agenda. That has been reversed under
                devolution, but it can only continue to be reversed if the money
                is available. This Budget is a start.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted that there is an increase of
                £14·5 million in spending on water services. That will help to
                deal with the all the problems, including raising health
                standards, particularly in light of the cryptosporidium
                outbreak, which is much on our minds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the amendment moved by my
                Colleague, Mr Dodds. The amendment seeks to recognise that the
                regional rate is a significant burden on householders and on
                businesses. An increase of 8% — more than twice the rate of
                inflation — is unacceptable. I usually challenge people’s
                actions rather than question their motives. However, the motive
                here is fairly clear. The regional rate is being increased
                because ultimately the Assembly will not be blamed. The poor
                councillors will be blamed, since the rates bill comes from the
                council, does it not?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister can increase the regional rate
                substantially, and the boys and girls in the councils will get a
                kicking for it from the electorate. No matter how prudent they
                might have been in their local authority — even if they have
                reduced their district rate — the Minister’s whopping 8%
                rise in the regional rate will remove any advantage, and
                councillors will get the blame.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional rate is merely an additional
                form of taxation. There was once a link with water services, and
                the public believed that it was paying for water and sewerage
                improvements. That is no longer the case as that link has been
                broken. This is the Durkan tax; it is direct taxation. We were
                not given tax-raising powers under the Northern Ireland Act 1998
                but we have adopted them in the form of the regional rate.
                Business people in particular, who have great difficulties in
                making a living, must now deal with a significant increase in
                the regional rate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt about the community’s
                view on this increase. The Minister could have addressed it with
                very little difficulty. As he did not, we have taken from his
                Budget the most useless items of expenditure — the squandering
                and wasteful &quot;North/Southery&quot;, the so-called Civic
                Forum and other elements that amount to about £20 million. He
                would have to take £12 million from this — his figures are
                not very precise — to reduce the regional rate to the rate of
                inflation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He has rightly said that some of the work of
                the bodies that we named would be done anyway. We have left £8
                million for this to be done in the relevant Departments. This
                amendment should commend itself to the Assembly, as I know it
                will commend itself to the public.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw attention to the fact that I am the
                first Member of the Opposition to speak this morning. All
                previous speakers have been from parties that are in the
                Executive. I have never seen so much wriggling, squirming and so
                many would-be Pontius Pilates. &quot;This is not our document.
                Oh no, don’t blame us, don’t tarnish us with this&quot;.
                They have not dipped their hands in the bowl for ablution —
                they have immersed their whole bodies in search of salvation.
                However, it must be remembered that the Budget has been agreed
                by the Executive. Let everyone remember that the Executive
                consists of the Ulster Unionist Party, the Democratic Unionist
                Party, the SDLP and Sinn Féin.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Member please tell us when the
                Democratic Unionist Party agreed this Budget?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those with ears, let them listen. I am
                stating — <i>[Interruption.]</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. Members will address their remarks
                through the Speaker.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have difficulty in getting my message
                across, but the members of the Northern Ireland Executive —
                and I shall repeat them in case there is any doubt — are the
                Ulster Unionist Party, the Democratic Unionist Party, the SDLP
                and Sinn Féin. The public recognises and accepts that. To
                pretend otherwise is to treat the people of Northern Ireland
                with contempt. The people know for whom they voted and whom they
                put in the Executive, and the members of the Executive must
                accept that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should not criticise that. I am trying to
                win a case, and the case is that the regional rate should not be
                increased by 8%. Two parties of the Executive are already
                scrambling to get in behind this justifiable premise. They are
                even prepared to turn their backs on the Executive of which they
                are members and come scrambling over to the Opposition. Imagine
                if the Chancellor of the Exchequer delivered his Budget only to
                find that his Colleagues had scrambled from the Government
                Benches to the other side of the House. Like Pontius Pilate,
                they do not want to touch his Budget. &quot;That is not our
                Budget&quot;, they say, &quot;Oh, no, no — save us from this
                terrible, terrible Budget&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Minister was speaking —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You have stated your case.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And I have a big case to state.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his statement the Minister referred to the
                revisions that had taken place and he used the words &quot;as a
                result of scrutiny&quot;. With the greatest respect, I must
                correct the Minister. No scrutiny of this Budget has taken place
                at any stage. Yes, there has been consultation, and, yes, there
                has been talk of scrutiny. However, scrutiny, as laid down in
                the Northern Ireland Act, means &quot;close examination
                of&quot;, and there has not been that necessary close
                examination of either the draft or the revised Budget. Do we
                need proof of this? The proof is that two of the Statutory
                Committees did not even have time to submit a written response
                on the draft Budget to the Finance and Personnel Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Finance and Personnel Committee did not
                have sufficient time to do its sole job of advising the Minister
                of Finance and Personnel and of assisting him to introduce the
                Budget. That has given us a Budget that is in many respects
                shallow and superficial. As Dr&nbsp;Birnie said, it does not
                allow us to get behind the figures, and we are still being
                promised public service agreements in January.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have not seen the public service
                agreements for setting targets and benchmarks for public
                expenditure and its results. That is a fundamental flaw. In many
                respects, our approach is a hand-me-down from previous regimes
                with some changes that I accept. Lack of time for proper
                scrutiny has resulted in the job’s not being done properly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey’s contribution almost reduced me
                to tears. I visualise him, arm up his back in excruciating pain,
                moving his amendment to reject an 8% increase in the regional
                rate with great reluctance, in spite of his party’s being part
                and parcel of the Executive. I was nearly crying; I was reaching
                for my handkerchief. The Democratic Unionist Party once again
                moved an unadulteratedly party political amendment that was
                clearly calculated to cause as much damage as possible to the
                Good Friday Agreement. The DUP is consistent, I will give it
                that. The amendment calls for the removal of North/South
                institutions and of the Civic Forum. &quot;Let power lie totally
                in the hands of politicians&quot;, says the DUP. Nevertheless,
                it says that it had to do this — for honourable reasons, of
                course, — to find the £8&nbsp;million to £11&nbsp;million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I find it very strange that when the DUP
                studied the figures — and it obviously did because it was able
                to cost what it called &quot;North/Southery&quot; — it missed
                one glaring figure for the Departments for Regional and Social
                Development. It seems to have ignored the fact that between the
                draft Budget and the present one the departmental running costs
                for the Department for Regional Development have gone up by
                £2·1 million while those for the Department for Social
                Development have gone up by £6·3 million. That is a massive
                £8·4 million between the two Departments. As every 1% increase
                in the regional rate equates to almost £2·2 million, lo and
                behold, 4% has been diverted to these Departments.</p>

                If he feels so passionately about this matter why did he not
                move an amendment rather than lecture the rest of us? Could he

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The impatience of the Gentleman! This is only
                a preamble, yet his party is already jumping at me to hear why I
                did not move an amendment. Do not get excited; calm down. Some
                Members seem to forget that during the take-note debate of 14
                November, I stated clearly that the Alliance Party would not
                support a Budget funded, even in part, by an 8% increase in the
                regional rate. We gave absolute responsibility to the Executive
                to do the decent thing and amend it. We hoped that the Executive
                would heed the views and concerns of Members, of the Finance and
                Personnel Committee, of local authorities and of the people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To date, they have not done that. I would not
                usurp their authority. I am proud to be a Member of the
                Opposition, and it strikes me that many people and one or two
                parties in the Executive would like to join the Opposition. We
                shall consider their applications, but I question some Members’
                behaviour. We may have to stand alone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why did we say that we would not support a
                Budget that was based on an increase of 8% in the regional rate?
                We did that for sound economic reasons but also for reasons of
                principle and consistency. It strikes me — and this has been
                brought home to me even more this morning — that inconsistency
                is one of the greatest scourges of politicians. We have the
                privilege of representing people. What do the people say? They
                say that some politicians will say one thing one day and do the
                opposite the next.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They promise the sun, the moon and the stars,
                but what do they deliver? Absolutely nothing. Politicians
                produce manifestos to fight an election. However, as soon as the
                election is over the manifestos are consigned to oblivion. They
                no longer matter, because the politicians are now in power.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 14&nbsp;November I pointed out that
                consistency was very important, and that we, along with councils
                and councillors throughout Northern Ireland (and over 60 Members
                of the House are also members of local authorities), had
                consistently opposed a large increase in the regional rate. On
                the same date I asked how anyone could possibly oppose a large
                increase in the regional rate when a member of a local authority
                but when in power ape the Tory overlords who foisted this on us
                for years. How can anyone do that and then face the electorate?
                For saying that, I was criticised and accused of being
                adversarial — note: adversarial. When I appealed to Members’
                social consciences to recognise that increases in the regional
                rate and in Housing Executive rents that were above inflation
                would hit the poor (specifically pensioners) and would drag
                people into the poverty trap, I was accused of indulging in —
                wait for it — populist stunts. This quarter also accused me of
                being a poor mathematician and in the next breath accused me of
                being a magician — just like that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the justification for these
                indefensible hikes in rent and rates? The justification is
                responsibility. Members of the Executive claim that they have
                such a responsibility. Some politicians will hide behind any fig
                leaf. Those of us not in the Northern Ireland Executive have no
                responsibility. We should sympathise with those in the Executive
                because they do. We poor people outside the Executive can
                indulge ourselves because we have no responsibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If being consistent, if having a social
                conscience, if protecting the poor, if democratically fighting
                for fairness is irresponsible, I stand guilty as charged. I
                shall submit to the people’s verdict; but of what shall I be
                accused? Shall I be accused of being populist? I remind those
                Members who say that I am a reject that this &quot;reject&quot;
                topped the poll in his constituency in the Assembly election.
                Members of the Gentleman’s own party stood in that election,
                so he should be very careful about the stones he is casting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate that the Executive have a very
                difficult job to balance the books. I appreciate that the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel has limited resources. I
                repeat: money was available in the system to provide the
                services without an 8% increase in the regional rate. Eight
                million pounds or £9&nbsp;million would reduce the increase to
                4% and approximately £11&nbsp;million would reduce it to 3%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is less than a fifth of 1% of the whole
                block. Therefore it comes down to priorities. I stress the
                importance of &quot;bottom-up&quot; economics. By removing
                people from the poverty trap we give them a sense of pride in
                society, and economic benefits will accrue. Large rent and rates
                increases are completely against that principle. They increase
                poverty; they drive more people into dependence on the state,
                and that results in an ever- increasing benefit culture.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Cobain touched upon that on 14 November
                when he referred to the cynics who say that 80% of Housing
                Executive tenants would not have to pay the increase in rents
                because they receive housing benefit, which is not paid out of
                the Northern Ireland block.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even a poor mathematician like myself
                recognises that all money comes from one cake — UK taxation
                — and the more that is spent on social benefits through the
                social security arm of UK taxation, the less will be available
                even for the Northern Ireland block grant. The same applies to
                the commercial sector. The more small retailers must pay in rent
                and rates, the less opportunity they have to grow. The regional
                rate, which is spread across Northern Ireland, constitutes
                approximately 66% of the entire rates bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The retail sector, particularly its service
                side, must grow. The Assembly should do its utmost to promote
                that growth rather than impede it. Large rates bills equal less
                employment. We must use any opportunity we have to increase
                employment in the service sector to catch up. I am thinking in
                particular of tourism. We must attract people to Northern
                Ireland; that will return the money by more than tenfold to the
                Exchequer or, I should say, to the Northern Ireland Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recently studied the family expenditure
                survey figures for Northern Ireland. They show that the average
                weekly income here is £102 a week less than in the rest of the
                United Kingdom. In fact, we have the lowest average weekly
                income of all regions in the United Kingdom. I may be a poor
                mathematician, but most people will agree with me that the lower
                one’s average income, the less one has to spend.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People in Northern Ireland must spend 25%
                more on electricity, 20% more on clothing and footwear and 8%
                more on food than the average person in the rest of the United
                Kingdom. The people of Northern Ireland therefore spend a
                disproportionate amount of their disposable income on the bare
                necessities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In spite of that, the Northern Ireland
                Executive are proposing to add to that burden by increasing the
                regional rate by 8%. The Budget proposes that Housing Executive
                rents be raised by more than 2% above the rate of inflation,
                reducing our people’s disposable income. We spend about £12 a
                week less on leisure services than the rest of the United
                Kingdom.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are to get Northern Ireland’s economy
                right we cannot ignore those lessons, and it saddens me that so
                far the Executive have ignored them. The Minister compared our
                proposed increases with England’s. That misses the big
                picture, and we cannot afford to do that if we are to make the
                necessary changes to the Barnett formula, for example. These
                arguments must be presented to the House and to the Treasury.
                Need and relative incomes are fundamentals that cannot be
                ignored in any society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reallocations in the October monitoring
                round could have been used to mitigate the proposed increases in
                the rents and rates. The Minister assured us then that the 8%
                rise was needed to provide the services outlined in the November
                Budget. He also assured us that any reductions would inevitably
                lead to a reduction in services. However, at that time
                approximately £75 million was available for reallocation. Some
                people called it &quot;easement&quot;. There was not one penny
                of easement for rent and ratepayers, despite pleas. It was a
                kick in the teeth for them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP pointed out that the 8% rise in the
                draft Budget was to be applicable for one year. This Budget
                tells us that it will roll on for another two years. That is a
                double kick in the teeth for rent and ratepayers. It is a clear
                demonstration that everyone’s pleas were ignored. They were
                not merely ignored, their noses were rubbed in it. I resent
                that. More could have been done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of the £75 million in the reallocation £20
                million came from the sale of Housing Executive houses through
                receipts, and more could have been done for these people. Those
                receipts were not anticipated. They could have been used to
                reduce Housing Executive rents. Four million pounds in the
                reallocation came from the regional rate through the final
                allocation of end-year flexibility for 1999-2000. That should
                have been used to keep the regional rate at an acceptable level.
                However, that was not one of the Executive’s priorities. The
                Executive regarded the 8% as a sacred cow. They would not bleed
                that sacred cow; but they were prepared to bleed the poor. That
                is very wrong. It is unfair and it is a kick in the teeth for
                all of us, including local authorities, who urged that the
                regional rate be kept at acceptable levels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party did not move an amendment, nor have
                I any intention of doing so. This is a matter of principle. I
                will not play party political games with a Budget. I said that
                my party would vote against the Budget, and we will do that if
                the necessary changes are not made. It is not too late to do it,
                even at this eleventh hour. I appeal to the Executive and to the
                other parties to row in behind us and insist that this Budget be
                changed to accommodate a less than 8% increase in the regional
                rate. It can be done. It is the Executive’s duty to do this.
                We shall keep our promise and reject this Budget if those
                changes are not made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our reason for not moving an amendment is
                vitally important. This Budget is a key decision. With regard to
                key decisions, the Alliance Party is discriminated against
                because it does not describe itself tribally. In effect, our
                votes do not count, for we are described as neither Unionist nor
                Nationalist in the roll of honour. That is a travesty of
                justice, of the agreement and of the law. Even if we moved an
                amendment, it would not count. In that respect our votes are
                less than worthless. We will not be part of such a charade. I
                appeal to the better judgement of the Executive to change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want society to change. I want to cross
                bridges and divides rather than stick labels on people. However,
                if labels mean more, there is nothing I can do. You can vote
                against us and reject us and tell us that we do not count. You
                can put us, in many respects —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We discuss the Budget proposals against a
                backdrop of crises in nearly all Departments, particularly in
                the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and
                the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. At the same
                time, the Budget proposals allocate about £6 billion combined
                with an 8% increase in the regional rate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The case against the 8% increase has been
                made very substantively by the mover of the first amendment. It
                will fall heavily on the poor and will damage business, which is
                already suffering from the differential in fuel and electricity
                costs. At the same time it is being used to finance a
                combination of bureaucratic waste and a politically driven
                all-Ireland agenda. I say &quot;politically driven&quot; because
                the detail of this agenda has never been subject to any
                substantive economic evaluation. We do not know what return we
                shall get but we can be pretty sure that any possible returns
                that may accrue to this all-Ireland agenda will not offset the
                harmful effects of an entirely unwarranted — indeed,
                outrageous — increase in the regional rate this year and in
                future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Departments face acute crises. This
                is combined with a very large distribution of money and an
                increase in the regional rate. However, one of the most striking
                features of this whole so-called Programme for Government is
                that there is no substantive immediate or medium- term policy
                justification upon which either the overall allocation of the
                money or its detailed use in the Departments could be argued. In
                other words, there is no innovative thinking in the Budget
                proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is nothing remotely resembling a
                grounding in policy. That would require detailed analysis of the
                crises facing each Department and an evaluation of the various
                options available to deal with them. Such considerations are
                entirely absent from this so-called Programme for Government. In
                other words, it is not a Programme for Government in any sense
                at all. Spending £6 billion and imposing an outrageous 8%
                increase in the regional rate with no substantive policy
                statement is merely throwing money at the problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two possible outcomes. Throwing
                money at a problem is unlikely to produce any result. It would
                be a waste of taxpayers’ hard-earned money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A good example is the recent proposals of the
                Minister of Higher and Further Education, Training and
                Employment. I have read these proposals very carefully, and the
                only way to make sense of them is to say that the Minister was
                caught between two constraints. He was caught between the
                commitments in his party’s manifesto and the Government’s
                being unable ever to finance student fees comprehensively again.
                This ragbag of proposals makes no sense. That does not surprise
                me, for I heard the same Minister on a recent ‘Seven Days’
                programme not only professing his ignorance of elementary
                English literature but trying to turn his ignorance into an
                intellectual virtue. What else can one expect when such a man is
                in charge of a Department?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why have the Executive not produced coherent
                policies to enable Members to evaluate the proposals reasonably
                and sensibly? It is because the Executive lacks any mechanisms
                for collective decision making. There is no collective
                responsibility in the Executive, and it is not surprising that
                their statements lack policy coherence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second amendment reflects the absence of
                any real policy coherence in the Executive. The second amendment
                opposes a decision reached by the Executive; yet it is being
                moved by a party that has two Members in the Executive, who,
                presumably, agreed it. That shows that decision making in the
                Executive is in chaos.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It gives me no pleasure to say this, but,
                unfortunately, precisely the same is true of the first
                amendment, although I agree entirely with its substance. The
                first amendment opposes an 8% rate increase, but it was moved by
                a former Minister who made two Pledges of Office — first, to
                participate with Colleagues in preparing a Programme for
                Government; secondly, to support all decisions of the Executive
                and the Assembly. A Member is moving an amendment — and I
                agree with all his arguments — who agreed to give a blank
                cheque of approval to all the Executive’s decisions. He simply
                cannot mount any credible opposition to this process in general
                and to the decisions of the Executive in particular from such a
                position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are throwing £6 billion at our problems
                and imposing punitive economic measures, yet there is no
                collective responsibility and no coherent policies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are in this mess because people were
                appointed to the Executive regardless of their expertise.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, the Minister of Agriculture
                inherited a crisis in agriculture, many of the causes of which
                are beyond the Assembly’s control. That must be said. However,
                despite being presented with the opportunity to have the BSE ban
                lifted, she failed to seize it. Now, unfortunately, the BSE
                crisis in Europe is such that the ban is unlikely ever to be
                lifted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has displayed marked
                incompetence in handling a portfolio. That also explains the
                incoherence of today’s document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every time the Minister of Health defends her
                policy in the media, she substitutes the word
                &quot;clearly&quot; for coherent argument. The word
                &quot;clearly&quot; — even if screeched at the top of one’s
                voice — is not a substitute for a coherent argument. That this
                individual repeatedly deploys this word, and various other
                rhetorical devices as substitutes for arguments, clearly
                demonstrates her inability to handle the portfolio that the d’Hondt
                system threw at her.</p>

                to the Budget, and I admit that I was, perhaps with some
                justification, digressing slightly. The main issue is that
                several areas in Northern Ireland are in acute crisis. We have
                £6 billion to spend and we are deploying it blindly. Money is
                being thrown at problems; yet there is no coherent policy.
                Therefore we can expect little from this Budget — despite all
                the rhetoric that has been heaped upon it — to alleviate our
                real problems.</p>

                I was formerly on the board of the Northern Ireland Housing
                Executive. I therefore have a particular interest in housing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget sets out to modernise our fiscal
                accountability. Linking spending allocations to clear targets
                for delivery will lead to greater efficiency and to better value
                for money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the introduction of public service
                agreements; these will open up to detailed scrutiny each
                Department’s objectives and the means by which they will be
                achieved. Furthermore, I welcome the use of the principles of
                resource accounting in assessing public spending and the
                services delivered or results attained thereby. I hope that the
                work of the Public Accounts Committee will be made easier by
                those innovations. I am confident that local democratic control
                and scrutiny will lead to greater accountability in the
                management of our resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Housing is a particular interest of mine,
                and, frankly, I am disappointed that it has been given such low
                status in the Budget. In his statement of 12 December the
                Minister promised an additional £2 million for housing to deal
                with the difficulties of north Belfast. As I represented that
                area on Belfast City Council I welcome that. However, that
                allocation deals with a one-off situation and does not affect
                the overall housing plan for Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Housing needs are changing. There are more
                one-parent families, single occupancy is growing and there has
                been a fall in household sizes. There has also been substantial
                growth in the number of privately owned homes, which has been
                partly caused by the sale of Housing Executive properties. I
                have supported such sales — and I shall continue to support
                them — but there is still a need for social housing. Lack of
                funding for the Northern Ireland Housing Executive could lead to
                important schemes to replace windows or kitchens being put on
                the back burner. I was heartened by the Minister’s assurance
                to Mr Leslie on 12 December that the Executive would pay due
                regard to the needs of all Departments in future monitoring
                rounds. I hope that housing will not be given a back seat in
                future rounds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The demand for social housing is not being
                met. Government financial policies have led to annual cuts in
                funding for the Housing Executive. Although the housing
                associations do excellent work, it is necessary that the Housing
                Executive continues to provide housing as well as performing its
                strategic role. The Housing Executive should become a housing
                corporation, or a housing association with the powers of a
                housing corporation, so that it would have access to private and
                public funding. In his reply to my question the Minister said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;private finance initiatives and public
                and private partnerships is one important consideration that we
                have in mind.&quot; —<i>[Hansard, 12 December 2000, p49]</p>
                </i></font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That should be borne in mind, and the Housing
                Executive should be given access to private funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The annual shortfall in housing starts will
                be about 400. That figure is taken from ‘Review and
                Perspectives 2001-2004’, which concluded that there was a need
                for an annual social build programme of 2,100 dwellings. That is
                still 400 homes short of what is needed. Providing decent
                accommodation for all should be one of the Executive’s
                priorities, so that the good work of the Housing Executive over
                the past 30 years can be continued.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of the Environment’s
                Planning Service is to receive a further £800,000 to accelerate
                the production of development plans, including the Belfast
                metropolitan plan. I welcome that move. As a councillor in
                Lisburn, I have watched the progress of the Lisburn area plan;
                its slowness has caused great frustration to countless people,
                including me. I am not sure that it is only a funding issue; the
                whole system must be overhauled. Anything that can speed up the
                provision of housing in Northern Ireland should be welcomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the first Northern Ireland Budget for
                many years that will receive full scrutiny, although I hope that
                we shall have more time for scrutiny in future. I welcome the
                Executive’s plans and look forward to many more Budgets that
                will lead to greater prosperity and a better life for all our
                people.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister must wonder what people will be
                for in his Budget, having listened all morning to what they are
                against. It is much easier to dwell on problems than to find
                solutions. I welcome the Budget and its focus on solutions
                although I have concerns about it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has consulted from the outset,
                and that is important. Unfortunately, we do not know how
                productive the consultations were or what revisions were made
                between October and December as a result. The process has shown
                the way forward by giving Members an opportunity to make a
                contribution. It is also useful that the public — those who
                knew about the consultations — made its contribution. That the
                Civic Forum may in future have a say on how we spend our money
                is also to be welcomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like other Members, I am concerned about the
                time scale. I am a member of two Committees, both of which had
                great difficulty in scrutinising the Budget properly. We need
                more audit trails, although the Minister cannot solely be blamed
                for a lack of them. In their absence, this devolved Assembly
                will be no different from what preceded it under the Northern
                Ireland Office. We must know where the money is going, how much
                is being spent and what is being purchased.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not have an audit trail for each
                Department. That is certainly true of the Department of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety. To date, it has been
                difficult to get answers about what happens to money when it
                goes to boards and trusts. We must know which boards and trusts
                are spending money efficiently and effectively; whether they are
                robbing Peter to pay Paul and whether they are taking from one
                part of the health budget to cover a deficit in another.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome such scrutiny, even though it has
                created difficulties. Nonetheless, it is important that
                Committees be given sufficient time to respond to the Budget in
                future. The Assembly requires a strategy for an audit trail, and
                that, as well as a call for a review of the Barnett formula,
                should be spelt out in future Budgets.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Expenditure can only be discussed in relation
                to income — how much money comes in and how much goes out. It
                has been difficult to follow the debates between October and
                December on the extra incoming funds and on how much will be
                spent in different quarters. The Executive programme funds have
                increased considerably. I would like to have seen a breakdown of
                where the increase came from. I have tried to follow that in the
                Budget to establish who got what money and from where. However,
                that has been a difficult road to follow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are the four parties in Government in favour
                of private finance initiatives (PFIs)? Is that how the Executive
                will seek finance in future? There is only one reference in the
                Budget to PFIs. On page 40, the paragraph entitled ‘Infrastructure
                Renewal’ states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;where appropriate related to the use of
                PFI/PP.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is one tiny sub-clause on what has
                become an income generation mechanism for the public sector. I
                have enormous concerns about that. If it is not clearly spelt
                out, either in the Programme for Government or in the Budget, we
                shall be left to the devices of private developers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is at present a major contradiction.
                This is not joined-up government. The Department of Education
                sold a substantial piece of land in south Belfast to a private
                developer. It is currently the subject of a planning appeal, and
                the Department of the Environment has said that the Department
                of Education did not fulfil its function of carrying out a
                community impact study before selling the land. One section of
                the Department of Education was not talking to the other and
                decided that that land was surplus to its needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When did public land and open space that was
                a community facility become surplus to needs without the
                community’s being consulted? It has put a great deal of money
                into the hands of private developers and not into the hands of
                the public sector. That means short-term gain for long-term
                pain. Major areas of infrastructure are being mortgaged, and
                they will always have first call on the Budget because they will
                require money for maintenance or leasing before those parts of
                the education sector that have not adopted PFIs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to hear a cohesive, co-ordinated
                response on the future decision on the finance of the public
                sector. Will a slice of it come from PFI, and what percentage
                will that be? If that is not the case — and there are still
                doubts — let us see what is. However, five words in the Budget
                on PFIs is not sufficient — especially when England and the
                devolved regions, Scotland and Wales, are raising concerns about
                them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is difficult to have an accountability
                mechanism addressed in the large funds of the Executive
                programme. The Budget states that the Assembly will be told in
                January who has had a call on them. However, as this is a Budget
                debate, I should like to know now where those funds are
                destined.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment announced his own proposals. However, he
                told the Assembly that he will not know how many of those
                proposals will be implemented until the findings of the new
                direction fund have been agreed by his Executive Colleagues. The
                Minister has made public his proposals, yet we shall not know
                until January whether the Minister has been successful in
                bidding for some of them. We should debate whether the proposals
                would see the light of day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the £6 million for the community
                regeneration fund this year — an increase of £3&nbsp;million.
                The Minister knows of my concern about what is happening in the
                community sector. Peace I has run out, and it will be some time
                before Peace II is available. Can some of this &quot;community
                regeneration&quot; money be used to help the groups that must
                lay off workers?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that the children’s fund will be
                substantial. However, there is no commitment to the appointment
                of a children’s commissioner, which was part of the Higher and
                Further Education, Training and Employment Committee’s
                recommendations on secure and residential accommodation. I
                welcome the thematic approach of the Programme for Government.
                The Committee felt that appointing a children’s commissioner,
                as other devolved regions have done, was an important part of
                joined-up government. It does not cost a great deal of money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, a response from the Minister
                for Social Development informed us that we do not know how many
                children in Northern&nbsp;Ireland live in poverty. The Republic
                of Ireland, Wales, Scotland and England know, but not
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. They will simply take a proportion of
                low-income groups and of those on benefits from the family
                expenditure survey. As that does not give us a figure, how can
                we have social integration or an anti-poverty strategy? It is
                not called that, but the thematic approach of the Programme for
                Government is probably focusing on an anti-poverty strategy, and
                I look forward to its liaising with the Civic Forum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will be difficult to set aside the
                resources if we do not have the information in the first place
                — information is powerful. If we know how many people are
                living in poverty we shall know how much money is needed. It is
                not the Minister’s responsibility to produce such information,
                but he will find it hard to develop an anti-poverty strategy
                without the necessary information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that the capital budget is decreasing
                rather than increasing in some Departments, particularly in the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. It is
                shocking that the budget for hospitals and the building of
                hospitals will decrease over the next three years. It is not
                possible to have the determination of the acute hospitals review
                now, but we should be sufficiently flexible to know that we need
                these hospitals and that we need some new build.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am particularly concerned about the
                judicial review on the Royal Victoria Hospital and Belfast City
                Hospital last week. We were promised a purpose-built women’s
                hospital for maternity services in the City Hospital. I visited
                the Royal Victoria Hospital last week and was shocked to see
                17&nbsp;women in a very small ward. I gave birth in that ward
                15&nbsp;years ago. There are now beds up the middle of the ward,
                and there is one bathroom for 17&nbsp;women. We would probably
                see something similar if we visited other hospitals for new
                mothers. Maternity hospitals are closing down. Mr&nbsp;McGrady
                said that Downpatrick Maternity Hospital is also facing a
                crisis. What will happen if it closes? Are we sending more
                mothers to the Belfast hinterland?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We know that hospitals are closing. Belfast
                City Hospital accommodated 3,000 patients and there are now
                6,000 patients on one site. We urgently need a new purpose-built
                hospital. There are no plans for one, and I cannot see where the
                money will come from. We have done a disservice and told people
                an untruth. They were promised a new hospital, but it is not in
                the Budget. I shall judge deeds not words. If the money has not
                been set aside, the hospital will not be built. That is a poor
                message after the court’s decision that the manner of the
                hospitals’ closure led to many questions being asked.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ministers may bid for large sums of money.
                The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety bid
                for £21 million for mental health and learning disability. She
                got £3 million — £1·5 million for mental health and £1·5
                million for learning disability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our new Government and our new Assembly are
                sending out the message that the mental health needs of the
                entire country are worth £1·5 million over the next year. That
                falls far short of £21 million. We are not getting the
                medium-secure units so we continue to violate human rights
                legislation by sending those with mental illness to Scotland.
                They should be diverted from the criminal justice system. These
                are people with serious psychiatric needs, yet no medium-secure
                hospital will be built in Northern Ireland. Of course, we could
                sell the land at Knockbracken, which is owned by the
                Knockbracken Trust, and go down the private-finance road once
                again. We have already lost some of our public space and some
                beautiful land, which is now a rare commodity in Belfast. Again,
                the Budget does not provide for what is needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mental health carers are enormously concerned
                that they must continue to pick up the pieces. CAUSE, a major
                carers’ group, recently sent a petition, which had been signed
                by all its members, desperately pleading for the money to
                empower them and those for whom they care and to free them from
                the stigma attached to mental illness. They are weary of living
                in isolation and urge that they be allowed a share of the
                support that is so openly given to other groups. They plead from
                their heart, as they cannot walk away from the responsibilities
                with which they must live every day. If those suffering from
                mental illness are to be moved out of long-stay hospitals,
                carers will increasingly have to look after them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a debate in the Assembly last week
                on the protection of children. I am putting down a marker: we
                are not meeting our statutory responsibility, and the Assembly
                — and its Members — will be taken to court, as the
                Department was last week. Judicial review after judicial review
                will be carried out as we send our children to places that are
                inappropriate for their needs. There is a shortage of 115 places
                in residential care, and that is creating a crisis. Children are
                absconding from residential care. They come in the front door
                and go out the back. Over 69 of them were missing for over 24
                hours in one board area alone. One child was missing for 69
                days.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This cannot go on. After all, The Children
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 is supposed to be progressive
                legislation. I have no doubt that in future the Minister may
                spend more time in court than in her Department if we do not set
                the necessary Budget resources aside for these places. If we do
                not meet our statutory responsibility we leave it to the courts
                and not to our Ministers to decide their governmental
                responsibilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I find myself, for a change, agreeing with
                the former Minister for Regional Development. I too believe that
                road developments should be based on criteria. When shall we see
                the draft regional development strategy? I hope that it comes
                before the Assembly by summer. We are, after all, spending £40
                million on the M2 Westlink and the Dunmurry slip roads. Is this
                money being spent well? Why did we have a hugely expensive
                planning inquiry when there was supposed to be a draft strategy?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would have assumed that the Government made
                decisions by deciding on a strategy, by making plans and putting
                them into action and budgeting accordingly. Instead, they are
                setting aside a large slice of the Budget to build a
                questionable infrastructure. Otherwise why hold a major planning
                inquiry before they have produced their development strategy?</p>

                cover all its responsibilities. If I ask my students to analyse
                a question I must give them information. We cannot analyse this
                Budget line. The word &quot;victims&quot; is not mentioned in
                the responsibilities. That is a very poor message on a day when
                we should be commending the Minister for completing what was no
                doubt an arduous task and for producing the Budget so quickly.
                This should be the last Budget to contain one line from the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.</p>

                efficiency, improving housing conditions and helping small
                businesses. We must make a balanced judgement, and that
                judgement has come down in favour of the way forward with regard

              of course, be expected to happen from time to time, but it happens
              so regularly that I have made enquiries at the Business Office.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that there are at least two
              reasons for this. First, many Members table questions very close
              to the deadline when it is not possible for matters to be checked.
              What is perhaps even more troublesome is that some Members do not
              accept the Business Office’s advice on who the question should
              be asked of. These Members insist that the Business Office table
              their question only to find that the Department shares the view of
              the Business Office and not that of the Member. I advise Members
              that it is in their own interests to accept the Business Office’s
              advice, which is given in good faith. It may not be perfect
              advice, and it may not always be correct, but it is correct at
              least as often as Members are.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive recently discussed how best to
              take this important review forward. The review will have to
              examine all elements of public administration since the
              establishment of the Assembly and the Executive, and we must
              ensure that it is carried forward effectively. Officials have been
              asked to prepare for further discussions in the new year, after
              which we hope to decide how to proceed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can, however, report that the Executive do
              believe that an independent element would be appropriate, and
              officials have been asked to bring forward a range of options for
              the conduct of the review that reflects this. This is necessary to
              ensure public confidence. In addition, widespread consultation
              will be needed to enable everyone to contribute to the review. The
              Executive will consider these matters carefully to ensure that the
              review is inclusive, objective and has credibility.</p>
              <b>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Deputy First Minister agree that it is
              a good thing that the review’s emphasis should be on public
              administration and that it should not be a review of local
              government only, as is sometimes mooted? Does he also agree that
              this is important, as local councils account for only 2·8% of
              expenditure, while bodies, boards and quangos are responsible for
              56% of public expenditure? Is the Minister aware of the Irish
              Civil Service’s strategy, prepared in 1996 and entitled ‘Delivering
              Better Government’, and will he consider this and reviews in
              other member states when preparing the terms of reference for a
              new review in public administration?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assemblyman is right to put this matter in
              perspective. Much of the thought and many of the utterances on
              this issue have centred inexplicably on the question of local
              government. It is clear from the expenditure that it is, although
              crucial, only a part of it. The general administration is
              crucially important.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must learn the lessons gained elsewhere and
              we must incorporate international best practice where possible. We
              must recognise the value of engaging independent external experts
              where necessary who can bring a different dimension to the case.
              There is a widespread change in attitudes to the quality and
              efficiency of public administration across the European Union. The
              Republic of Ireland is delivering better government. Another
              example can be seen in the UK’s modernising government
              initiative, which has been far-reaching. At present, the European
              Commission is undergoing a major programme of reform, which may
              yield valuable lessons as well.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Examining these initiatives, and others, in EU
              countries will be an important task for the review team. Such
              research can help us in many ways, although it may not all be

              that local government is an important part of any review. Having
              established the need for a review of public administration, does
              he accept that unnecessary delay in completing it will lead to
              uncertainty and will undermine the goal of improved accountable
              democracy? Can he assure the House that the review will be carried
              out as urgently and as efficiently as possible?</p>

              regard it as a very important part of our administration. Once the
              Executive have agreed the way forward, it will be in the best
              interests of everyone to undertake the review as quickly and as
              efficiently as possible. It will be a very complex task, perhaps
              one of the most complex tasks that the Assembly will undertake in
              this session. It is essential that we proceed quickly to end all
              political uncertainty and to end uncertainty in councils and among
              the staff of the sections of administration that are to be
              reviewed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential that the review be carried out
              efficiently, systematically and thoroughly. The key principles of

              Proposals for change must be considered carefully, and all
              relevant people must be consulted. We cannot afford to cut any
              corners and we shall not have any undue delay.</p>

              timetable. Once the remit has been prepared, the review could take
              up to 18 months to be completed. After that, there will be a
              period of consideration by the Executive, followed by legislation.
              The review is likely to change the number of district councils, so
              there may have to be a boundary revision. It may take up to two
              years after its public phase.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If that is the case, it may take three or four
              years for real change to take place in local government. Is there

              afford to get it wrong. Therefore the Assemblyman is quite right.
              It must be thorough, and its research and thinking must stand us
              in good stead — not just for the next five years but for the
              next 25, 30, and 40 years. I regard it as a matter of the utmost

              crime when he signed an agreement that let all the criminal

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The detailed and extensively researched report
              produced by Professor Knox and his colleagues is being studied
              with great interest. It shows clearly that the scourge of
              so-called punishment attacks is all too prevalent, at a terrible
              cost to individuals, families and communities. It highlights the
              need for an accountable police service and an accountable criminal
              justice service that enjoy the support and confidence of everyone
              that they serve. Although criminal justice and policing are
              reserved matters, this Administration will do all that it can to
              tackle the underlying social problems that can contribute to crime
              and to ensure that the needs of victims of violence are met with
              high-quality, effective services. Many organisations are trying to
              deal with these issues, and the Executive’s commitment to
              victims is outlined in the draft Programme for Government.
              Criticisms of devolved areas of responsibility in Professor Knox’s
              report will be examined, and I shall ensure that the report is
              brought to the attention of the Minister whose Department is
              directly involved.</p>

              their part in bringing pressure to bear on organisations that

              matter rather than an accountancy one. Lives are ruined and
              society is damaged by these attacks; more is involved than the
              financial implications for individual Government Departments. I
              wish it were as easy as tabulating the cost. This matter is not

              the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
              have already established an interdepartmental working group on
              victims under the chairmanship of the junior Ministers, Mr Haughey
              and Mr Nesbitt. The group aims at developing a strategic approach
              to the issues that victims face, and it is one of the action
              points in the draft Programme for Government, which states that it
              is planned to have a cross- departmental strategy in place by
              April 2001.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, a programme of capacity building
              for policy makers will begin with a major conference at the end of

              not here to answer. I take it upon myself to state that I do not
              agree with that assessment. This is not a problem that can be

              railway line now has other uses, and at Comber it forms part of
              the Comber bypass. However, a railway line could be reinstated on
              much of the remaining alignment without major acquisition of
              property. With the exception of the section from the Holywood

              of the route. The costs of doing so would be significant. The cost
              of relaying existing track on the Belfast to Bangor line is
              approximately £1&nbsp;million per mile; the cost of reinstating a

              Given the congestion in traffic coming from Newtownards and Comber

              metres of road or when night-time accident statistics have shown

              policy evaluation programme accepted that the present policy for
              providing street lighting in rural areas helped to reduce adverse
              impact on the rural environment. However, the study did recommend
              a policy review to look at consistency of approach and customer
              dissatisfaction. Until that review is completed, I cannot comment

              These include increased freight use and retaining the Antrim to

              pilot the concept, and a scheme promoted by the Belfast
              Regeneration Office is proposed for the New Lodge area of Belfast.
              An evaluation of its outcome, and a small number of pilot schemes

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to accelerate action to increase traffic
              calming in residential areas. I propose to initiate up to 10 pilot
              schemes across Northern Ireland that will give local communities a
              greater role in agreeing what measures are appropriate in their
              areas. The outcome of these pilot schemes will inform our

              they are in the process of being so. They will be selected from
              the schemes that have already been prioritised. I have raised the
              matter in my Department because there has been a huge increase in
              the number of applications for traffic-calming measures in
              Northern Ireland, as the hon Member and others will know. In the
              Eastern Board area alone there are about 200 applications a year.
              To expedite matters, I have asked my Department to select the 10
              pilot schemes from the schemes that have already been prioritised.
              There will be no question of queue-jumping. They will be taken
              from the top of the list of prioritised schemes. They will be
              undertaken across Northern Ireland to see if there are measures

              spaces at Whitehead from 20 to 29. As the Northern Ireland

              whether an expansion of parking facilities at Whitehead is
              important enough to justify the necessary expenditure.</p>

              it is well aware of the value of such facilities in encouraging
              car drivers to switch to rail. When the track has been refurbished

              shall take questions 1 and 8 together. I have no plans to set up a
              coastal forum. I am grateful for the substantially increased
              resources proposed for the Environment and Heritage Service in the
              Executive’s recent draft Budget; they will help to implement EU
              Directives and to develop a biodiversity strategy. However, even
              these resources do not allow me to do everything that I wish, so I
              cannot establish and support a coastal forum at present. I agreed,
              in correspondence with Mr McGrady, that the Department could have
              supported such a forum only if all its bids had been successful.
              Subject to the agreement of other Ministers with responsibility
              for sea defences and infrastructure, however, I shall continue to
              keep the benefits of a coastal forum in mind for future budget
              rounds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department will also continue to liaise with
              the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, which is
              responsible for sea defences, and the Department for Regional
              Development, which is responsible for road, water and sewerage
              infrastructure in coastal areas.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suppose that I must thank the Minister for
              his response but I cannot thank him for its content. The report
              was published some months ago and the issue has been around for
              some time — one of his predecessors, Lord Dubs, promised action
              five or six years ago. I am disappointed that the Minister cannot
              provide any firm commitment. How much would it cost to establish a
              coastal forum and why is it such a problem for his Department in
              the Budget?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot give details of the cost at present
              but I shall do so in a written answer. I understand that the
              previous direct rule Administration did give an undertaking to
              establish a coastal forum to advise on the development of a
              coastal zone strategy. However, as in so many areas of
              environmental protection and conservation, no additional resources
              were allocated at that time to fulfil the commitment. There is no
              point in making commitments if they cannot be backed up with
              resources — that is my problem.</p>
              <b>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that the Minister’s answer is
              definitive and that a forum will not be established. That is a
              great pity, and I ask the Minister to reconsider. A coastal forum
              involving environmentalists and representatives of district
              councils and tourism bodies need not cost a great deal of money.
              It could almost be provided for by the relevant district councils.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On one hand, there is great concern about the
              economic development of coastal areas, and on the other about
              their environmental protection. The Antrim and Down coasts are
              suffering terrible erosion. Some measures must be taken, otherwise
              there will have to be a retreat from the ravages of the sea. Can
              the Minister also take the matter up with the North/South
              Ministerial Council?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Coastal erosion is the responsibility of
              several Departments, not just mine. It is the duty of the
              Department of Agriculture and Rural Development through its Rivers
              Agency to maintain sea defences. The Department for Regional
              Development’s Roads Service is responsible for roads, water and
              sewerage infrastructure, including any affected by coastal
              erosion. We are not against the forum, but we lack the money at
              present.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland biodiversity working group
              presented recommendations to me in October 2000 for a Northern
              Ireland biodiversity strategy. Those recommendations are being
              examined. I acknowledge the potential benefits of a coastal forum
              but I cannot agree to this or to any other recommendation unless
              the money is available. Despite what Mr McGrady says, it would
              cost money, and we do not have any at present. However, I shall
              continue to keep the benefits of a coastal forum in mind in future
              Budget bids.</p>

              These include the Belfast urban area plan and the Carrickfergus,
              Lisburn and Newtownabbey area plans. The North Down and Ards area
              plan covers the North Down Borough Council area, which falls into
              the Belfast metropolitan area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall launch the Belfast metropolitan area
              plan shortly. It will provide a planning and policy framework for
              future development up to the year 2015. It will take account of
              the draft regional development strategy, any subsequent amendments
              made to the strategy as a result of scrutiny by the Executive
              Committee and all other relevant considerations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The programme for the preparation of the plan
              involves the publication of an issues paper in autumn 2001,
              publication of a draft plan towards the end of 2002-03 and
              adoption of a final plan in 2004-05. I intend the plan to include
              widespread and inclusive consultation, involving councils,
              business and community interests and the public.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The intention of the issues approach is to hear
              the public’s views on future development in order to assist the
              Department to develop planning proposals and policies. The action
              plan has been made possible by the Executive’s allocating the
              resources needed to assemble the Belfast metropolitan plan. This
              is very good news. It was announced in the 1999 Agenda for
              Government and confirmed in the Programme for Government and in
              the draft Budget.</p>

              area plans reach their end dates before the adoption of the
              Belfast metropolitan plan, current development plans provide
              detailed location and planning policies for the relevant parts of
              the Belfast metropolitan area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the plans will reach their end date
              before the publication of the Belfast metropolitan area plan. The
              plan for north Down and Ards reached its end date in 1995; the
              Belfast urban area plan, Carrickfergus area plan and Lisburn area

              2001; the Newtownabbey area plan will reach its end date in 2005.
              Nevertheless, these will be material considerations in all
              decisions. The plan recognised that there are strong local
              identities, and it will seek to give expression to this diversity.</p>

              be followed by more detailed research to identify specific

              Comptroller and Auditor General has therefore no responsibility
              for the auditing of local authority accounts. However, he does

              &quot;independent&quot; could be interpreted as meaning
              open-ended, but a budget is never open-ended. A budget is
              restricted, as any businessman or housewife will tell you, and is
              circumscribed by the amount of money available. In this case,
              income is restricted to the block grant and, to a lesser degree,
              the regional rate. No one gets everything, and priorities must be
              identified.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened with great interest to Members’
              demands and their often justifiable criticism of the lack of
              provision for this, that or the other. No one proposed that taxes
              should be increased or other revenues sought to provide for those
              worthy endeavours. An increase across the board of 7·8% — or 5%
              in real spending terms — is no mean achievement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The spread of funding across various actions
              illustrates the importance to Ministers of collegiality. Equally
              importantly, the Minister of Finance and Personnel has fully
              consulted the Assembly Committees and has made a significant
              response to their concerns where he could. He also made changes
              after consultation with the wider community. However, no budget
              can give everything to everybody; there is always a limit, and in
              this case the limit is the amount of money available. Obviously,
              some items have been highlighted, and quite rightly so. We have
              all welcomed the commitment to the student support review,
              particularly for those students whose parents are on low incomes.
              This clearly demonstrated a commitment to listen to the responses
              received after consultation from the recipients and the students’
              unions. A greater partnership than the Executive is at work. There
              is a partnership between the Executive, the Assembly, the
              community and the vested interest in the community. That greater
              partnership is the most significant, and it is often overlooked
              although it has achieved a great deal in a very short time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We may be committed to various causes, but our
              primary concern is of course our constituents and our
              constituency. This morning’s commitment to a general debate was
              very significant — although some were sidetracked into
              particulars. Nevertheless, the debate ranged widely and was very
              welcome.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are some matters in the Budget that I
              wish to speak about. Much has been said about deprivation, and
              there are many mechanisms for dealing with it. One of the greatest
              problems is the imprecision of the indices of deprivation, which
              can allow the relative wealth of a surrounding area to cloak
              severe deprivation. The Minister has told us that these indices
              are being studied much more closely in order to provide more
              precise targeting in future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A thread that unites all the parties in this
              Government is the democratic desire to address the urgent social
              problems in all our communities. Our discussions on the Budget in
              recent months — ministerial statements, draft Budgets and
              monetary funding discussions on how policies should be applied —
              have brought to light some alarming revelations of what took place
              during 30&nbsp;years of direct rule. In all Departments there is
              an enormously worrying and sometimes frightening shortfall in the
              development of our social services and in the maintenance and
              improvement of our infrastructure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not very glamorous to talk about roads,
              but past underinvestment has left them in a shocking state.
              Unfortunately, we shall be unable to fix them in one or even two
              budgets. Some of our sewerage and water systems are in the same
              horrendous state. They are totally antiquated. These facts were
              kept hidden from us — and I say that advisedly: they were kept
              hidden from us for years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can now compare the per capita spending on
              health and education in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland, and
              it is obvious that there is a shortfall there too. Although the
              Minister cannot do it in this Budget, I urge him to amend the
              Barnett formula. Several Members called it the formula that
              dictates our revenue. During those negotiations, which I hope will
              take place in 2001, he should identify and quantify that shortfall
              and ask for it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the short term — five to 10 years — it
              is not possible for our community to finance what has been denied
              effective funding for the past 30&nbsp;years. We simply cannot do
              that without going into the figures. If I am correct, we shall
              continue to fall further behind in the competition for an
              infrastructure that can support industry and in the competition
              for a social programme that will improve our educational and
              medical facilities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although several issues must be tackled
              urgently, for the moment I would like to digress into an industry
              that is very rarely spoken of, mainly because it affects only two
              constituencies, South Down and North Down. It is the fishing
              industry. A further reduction in the total allowable catch for the
              ensuing season of 2001 was recently announced. Most people
              probably did not read that. Some might have asked themselves what
              it means. It means that our fishing industry is on the verge of
              collapse. That is not a melodramatic statement. Every major
              whitefish species has been cut dramatically — from 44% to 27%,
              and now to 10%. Ironically, the only species the total allowable
              catch of which has increased is herring, at 40% and over. People
              no longer fish for herring. It is a dead industry. Those who could
              fish for herring in the past can no longer do so. The nets are not
              right and the boats are not right. Therefore it is not a panacea.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have spoken to fishermen in my constituency.
              Many have received only three&nbsp;weeks’ wages since last
              August and they often fall outside the social security net. This
              is because they go to sea and may catch nothing; they have been
              working, but working for nought. The budget of the Department of
              Agriculture and Rural Development must be rescheduled in the
              coming months to deal with this serious matter. I shall leave the
              question of the funding required in other areas to other Members.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am surprised that there have been so few
              amendments. Only two questions have been raised in the entire
              Budget. That is very heartening for everyone — especially for
              the Minister responsible. One would have expected hundreds of
              amendments. We have only two. This shows that every party in the
              House — whether part of the Executive or not, whether
              pro-agreement or anti-agreement — is fairly content with the
              proposed Budget. That augurs well for the future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment to withdraw funding from the
              North/ South bodies is transparently political and has very little
              to do with finances. The Assembly will treat it as such. I do not
              say that it is not a serious proposition — it is. It is the
              means by which the agreement could be destroyed. The intention
              behind the amendment was not to amend the Budget to get extra
              funds; the intention was to destroy one of the bedrock provisions
              of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not a serious financial amendment, yet
              it is the only one from a major anti-agreement party. That is
              quite miraculous and I am very pleased about it. The other
              amendment concerning the regional rate increase of 8% was
              expected. Everyone would like the rates to be reduced and to pay
              less in taxes. However, no one will decide where the money will
              come from.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is most surprising, given the collective
              responsibility of the Executive. I presume that the decisions on
              the funding from the block grant and on the regional rate were
              distributed and approved. A distribution cannot be approved
              without the approval of the receipt that provides for it.
              Therefore I assume that all parties were fully involved in
              agreeing the source of the revenue, followed by the distribution
              of that revenue to the various Departments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The mover of the amendment did not give a very
              convincing reason why the two Departments primarily benefiting
              from the regional rate happened to be the Departments of Education
              and Health. However, if there were merit in the proposal that the
              regional rate should be reduced — and we would all love it to be
              reduced — one would have assumed that, being in the same party
              as the Ministers of Health and Education, the mover would have
              said that the extra money for those Departments could be
              withdrawn. He would be happy for it to be withdrawn and be pleased
              that there would be fewer services in health and education. I did
              not, however, hear that argument. It is as if there are two, or
              perhaps three, political parties under the same name supporting
              this amendment. When I heard the Chairperson of the Finance and
              Personnel Committee’s contribution — and, as you will know, Mr
              Deputy Speaker, he was called to speak as the Chairperson — I
              thought it was a party political speech from beginning to end. Not
              only that, he was able by some mysterious means to assess the
              intent of a Committee that did not even vote on the matter. I
              would love to have such an understanding of any Committee that I
              served on; to be able to say &quot;If my Committee took a decision
              it would decide thus&quot;. I have never in all my life been in
              that position and I admire a Chairperson who is. However, there is
              a serious point. The Chairperson was not conveying the corporate
              opinion of the Committee; he was merely making a subjective
              personal statement. That must be wrong, as a Committee Chairperson
              when addressing the Assembly in his capacity as Chairperson must
              express the opinion of his Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been several astonishing
              contributions. We were told to put on our begging clothes, deepen
              our begging bowl and approach the British Government for more from
              the Exchequer. I support that argument. I have always supported
              that argument, and I found it very surprising from that quarter. I
              do not know about giving the argument some sort of rationale by
              throwing in &quot;We shall approach the Irish Government as well
              with a different begging bowl, perhaps in punts&quot;. There was
              no serious debate about what was meant by the proposition to
              abolish the increase in the regional rate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is not a person in the Chamber or in the
              community who does not want to pay less tax. However, I bet that
              the shopkeepers, the farmers who are so badly off, the fishermen
              and housewives would be prepared to pay a few pounds extra in
              their rates this year to get a better education and a better
              health service. I am almost certain that they would be willing to
              make the sacrifice. I would not make the same mistake that I
              accuse another of making — that of making a subjective
              judgement. A poll in Great Britain (although it was not voted for)
              showed that people would be prepared to make a sacrifice to ensure
              additional funding for health and education.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Liberal Democrats suggested in their
              taxation proposals that an extra penny should be raised from
              income tax. They were accused of increasing the range of services
              on which this extra penny would be spent. Is the Member in danger
              of falling into the same trap? Is he not in danger of spending the
              £11 million or £12 million from this increase over and over
              again to improve health and education? Is he not being too
              ambitious in what he thinks the regional rate rise can pay for?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hon Member makes a strong point, and his
              question is almost self-explanatory. Although people did vote for
              it in an opinion poll, they did not follow this through by voting
              in the general election to implement a proposition that had been
              so widely supported.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other matter raised was whether the rates
              increase is a kind of poll tax. There is no comparison between
              rates and the poll tax. They are entirely different in
              constituency, levy and circumstances. For the advancement of
              political posturing and to the disadvantage of the collegiate
              responsibility of the Executive, parties can play around with bits
              and pieces of the Budget.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is astonishing, however, that there were
              only two amendments to a Budget of such size and change. That
              shows the extent of its support among all parties in the Chamber.
              Now that the diversions are over, we can deal with the serious
              matters in the Budget. I hope that the vote will have the support
              of the entire House and will enable the Minister to deal with some
              of the serious new issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I compliment not just the Minister responsible
              for the Budget but all the other Ministers — Sinn Féin, UUP,
              SDLP and the DUP from afar. They all made a magnificent
              contribution to the Budget. I have no doubt that the parties in
              the House will support their own Ministers, whose Departments will
              benefit from the Budget. If they do not support their own
              Ministers, they will show a lack confidence in them and in their
              ability to achieve a fair deal.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is always a pleasure to follow the hon
              Member. As a young boy, I sat in the Strangers’ Gallery, as it
              was called, and listened to a debate one night when Cahir&nbsp;Healy,
              a famous Nationalist, spoke. I remember one Member rising to
              congratulate him, saying that it was a pity that he was not a
              family doctor. His attitude reminded the Member of a good family
              doctor at the bedside who knew that he was well remembered in the
              patient’s will. That describes Mr McGrady, who speaks with a
              quiet confidence that nothing he says can be called into question.
              Poor miserable specimens that do not share the vast brainpower
              that divides his ears must be patted on the head and told &quot;We
              shall give you a fool’s pardon&quot;. The people of Northern
              Ireland are not fools. The serious matter of the regional rate is
              something that we cannot ignore.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no use in telling us about the wonders
              of the Budget or about what Mr&nbsp;Durkan has done, or in saying
              that the only amendments are on the regional rate. This is the
              straw that will break the camel’s back. It is right for the
              House to be aware of this. Members may not like the wording of
              amendments. They may not even like amendments, but we live in a
              democracy. This is not a fascist dictatorship yet. We are entitled
              to bring forward our amendments and to have them discussed.
              However, some people thought that by mighty denunciation of
              individuals they could brush this matter under the carpet and
              safely put it away. However, that cannot be done.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close got very warmed up about this matter.
              I am glad that he is in the House now. He got very frustrated. He
              tried to put forward the strange thesis that if one was in a
              meeting and one disagreed with what the meeting did one was
              nevertheless responsible for its decision. That is a complete
              negation of democracy. I am a Member of this House. I will
              disagree with many of the things that it does, but this House does
              not bind me at all. I am free, so far, to express my views. My two
              Colleagues happen, by the vote of the people, to have been put
              into Government. They were put there not by the patronage of
              Westminster, Mandelson or Mo Mowlam, but by the votes of the
              people. These are votes that his party, by the way, did not get.
              His claim that my two Colleagues must be held responsible for this
              Budget is utter nonsense. I want to repudiate the misinformation,
              half-truths and bundle of misrepresentations thrown together in
              anger to throw mud at men who have made their position absolutely
              clear.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then we had Mr Roche, who is now absent along
              with every member of his party. He described Mr Peter Robinson as
              a &quot;hypocrite&quot;. I have the statement that Mr Peter
              Robinson made. I shall read it so that those who read the report
              of this debate will know exactly what Mr Robinson said on the
              occasion referred to by Mr Roche. Mr Robinson said:</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;May I very briefly set the context which
              allows me to respond positively to your enquiry about my
              willingness to take office. Everyone here knows that I am one of
              the sternest opponents of the Belfast Agreement. I have
              consistently maintained that the purpose and the objective of the
              agreement is to have Northern Ireland absorbed into a united
              Ireland through developing all-Ireland institutions. I still
              believe that to be the process underlying it. Whether a Member or
              a Minister, as a convinced Unionist I shall use every ounce of the
              influence I possess to frustrate and thwart Northern Ireland’s
              being conveyed into a united Ireland.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche, take note.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;My position, both in relation to the
              release of paramilitary prisoners and the destruction of the RUC
              through the apparatus devised by the Belfast Agreement, is on
              public record and is unchanged. Moreover, it remains for me a
              fundamental principle that only those who are committed to
              exclusively peaceful and democratic means are suitable partners in
              government. The call of my conscience and the commitments I have
              given to the people of Northern Ireland are unalterable. I oppose
              terrorism in all its forms and of every shade. Whether it be the
              murder of a friend or that of an odious adversary, I oppose it
              without qualification and without any mental reservation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as my conduct as a prospective Minister
              may be an issue, I want to place firmly on the record my intention

              exercising such responsibilities as may be in my charge. The
              religious conviction or political opinion of any person or group
              will form no part of the judgement I will make on any matter. I

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, as Mr&nbsp;Peter Robinson’s
              nominator, I was told that this could not be done. I was also told
              that if I nominated Members for the seats that the people of
              Northern Ireland had in their gift and which they gave to the
              Democratic Unionist Party, we would be ousted by law. We also
              heard the threats of the First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister. However, it was all vain talk because our lawyers were
              better than theirs — they told us the truth of the matter. These
              Members are still in the places of Government given to them by the
              votes of the people, rather than by patronage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close stood for election to the Forum and
              lost. He had to sit as a nominated Member. After the Assembly
              elections he told us that he had topped the poll but he did not
              tell us about the other figures. If he had looked at the other
              figures he would have discovered that although he might have
              topped the poll, the other candidates, after their votes had been
              added up, were miles ahead of him.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party leader told us that at the
              European election I would be laid very low and that he would come
              forward with such a bounce that the Alliance Party would be said
              to have been born again. The same man went down to my constituency
              to do his canvassing. He stood and waited at The Pentagon for half
              an hour and no one spoke to him so he issued a statement to the
              press. He said that he had been in the centre of Ian&nbsp;Paisley’s
              constituency and that no one had broached him on the matter of
              opposition to the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Why was this the case?
              Because nobody spoke to him. It is wonderful that some people
              believe they know what people are thinking. The only solid way of
              knowing how people think at an election is to stand at the ballot
              box. Then one gets the answer — the real answer.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is vital that the view that I express on
              behalf of my party be heard in the House, because this will be a
              very serious situation. One would have thought that after all
              that, Mr&nbsp;Close’s party would have moved a reasoned
              amendment; that he would have concentrated his great wisdom and
              powers on devising an amendment that might meet the need that he
              has in mind. However, no such amendment was produced. Our only
              means of expressing our views on that is to vote for the motion
              that will introduce the 8% increase in the regional rate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was legitimate criticism of
              Sinn&nbsp;Féin: it sat on the Executive Committee. Our Members
              never sit on the Executive Committee, yet Mr&nbsp;Close told us
              that they signed up to the Budget. They have never signed anything
              from that Committee and they never will.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They were pressurised. It is nice to know that
              the Minister of Education and the Minister of Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety can be pressurised. Their party then
              decided that it would not do for it not to take a stand on this
              issue, so it made a change.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I did not speak today as Chairperson of the
              Agriculture Committee; I intended to, but I did not because I had
              to deal with political points. It should not alarm Mr McGrady that
              this party is still against the Anglo-Irish Agreement, as indeed
              is the majority of the Unionist people. If Mr&nbsp;McGrady thinks
              that he has converted the natives, let us have a referendum
              tomorrow, and I shall abide by the result of it. But no, he does
              not want to see referenda; some people here do not want to see
              local government elections. Some of them dread Tony Blair’s
              going to the country too soon and would rather he delayed his
              application for a renewed mandate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What better way is there of reducing people’s
              financial burden than by forgetting about Foyle, Carlingford and
              Irish Lights? As the Irish Government have taken over these
              matters, let them pay for them. He that lights the light, let him
              pay for the oil. That is not in the Scriptures. I do not want Mr
              McGrady to think that it is.</p>

              Ireland are to be burdened with a rise in the regional rate. The
              House should say plainly to the Government and to those in power
              that we will not tolerate this terrible increase; that it will be
              a weight upon the shoulders of the people. It is very important

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tomorrow my Committee will convene a special
              meeting to discuss the fisheries catastrophe, and I welcome Mr
              McGrady’s words on this matter. A very bad decision has been
              made. I shall say no more until we have all the facts. However, I
              do know that the Minister told the Committee that she was sure
              that other representatives from the United Kingdom would stand
              with her in her battle — they did not.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Old Book says &quot;Put not your trust in
              princes&quot;, and certainly the prince who came from Westminster
              was not to be trusted, because up to the last minute he was going
              to go the right way only to go the wrong way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must find a way to save our fisheries. It is
              vital to the livelihood of the people who for generations have
              lived off the sea. Astonishingly, the United Kingdom joined the
              European Union with the greatest possible asset — the seas
              around our coasts. And what happened? Edward Health, in his folly,
              handed over our assets. The Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr
              Fischler, who comes from Austria and who never sees the sea, tells
              us that this is good for the people of Northern Ireland, good for
              the people of Britain and good for the people of the seas — the
              seas that his Union stole from the people whose right it is to
              fish them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tragedy is that we shall have to have major
              decommissioning, but it could be worse than that: in the sorrows
              and sadness and tragedy of the moment too many men will leave the
              fishing industry. Even if there were a turnaround in fishing,
              these men would not be able to return to use their expertise to
              bring the industry back to life and viability.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that Mr McGrady knows that in Kilkeel
              many men who sailed the waters now break stones in the quarries.
              Like convicts, they have been sent to mine the stones. This is the
              death of our fishing industry. We must find a way to save it; we
              must do our utmost to alleviate the distress that false friends
              have brought and to undo the damage caused by those who did not
              make their stand for the people when they should have.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why have we not tabled scores of amendments to
              this motion? Mr Durkan knows very well that this Budget has been
              rushed. He knows very well that the whole thing could have been
              stopped with one vote. But what about the hospitals? What about
              the schools? What about the roads? What about employment? What
              about new businesses in the pipeline? This was a price that my
              party would not pay, and although we were hammered and criticised
              we let this Budget go through because we had no viable option that
              was good for our Province.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now we come to consider the Budget. No doubt
              many issues will arise in the coming months that were not
              envisaged when the Budget was drawn up. Many things will come to
              light and there will be many hard places along the road.
              Nonetheless, a sum of money has been delivered to us, and it is
              our business to see that it is spent in the best possible way, for
              the best possible ends, and distributed to the neediest of our
              people. However, that is a matter for another day and for another
              debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tonight, however, I commend my party’s
              amendment. This issue must be highlighted, and if Mr Close felt
              the same he could have moved an amendment with no political tag
              attached. I am very glad that the Member for South Down has tagged
              our motion. I am glad that he recognises our uncompromising
              principles and that he accepts that we mean what we say and that
              we do what we say we shall do. The proposal to lay such a heavy
              burden on our people at this time is an outrageous one, and we
              must say so.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister on producing an
              historic Budget. It goes some way to redress the democratic
              deficit that has existed in this part of Ireland since partition.
              It is appropriate that a son of Doire Cholmcille — of Derry —
              should deliver the first Budget.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much has been made of the amendment, but if
              ever anyone made a virtue out of cheap political opportunism it is
              the DUP, and that has been very evident today. Its amendment is
              not about rates or the abolition of rates; one need only read the
              seven references to North/South bodies to know that this is an
              attack on the Good Friday Agreement. It is a device used by the
              DUP not because it has a deep social interest in the effects of
              rates but for attacking the very premise on which the Good Friday
              Agreement was built. Seven times it mentions North/ South bodies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We live on a small island, and I do not think
              that any Unionist, let alone Nationalist, businessman does not see
              the benefits of exploiting all the island’s potential for trade
              and business development. Hence the Trade and Business Development
              Body. We also have the Special EU Programmes Body and the Food
              Safety Promotion Board — there is no border for food safety.
              Those who know anything about tourism want to develop an
              all-Ireland tourism body because they recognise the potential in
              all-Ireland tourism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP’s amendment is more about exploiting
              cheap political opportunism than about the very sore issue of the
              rates. Sinn Féin’s Ministers do not run the party — there are
              no pontiffs in Sinn Féin. We leave the popes in Rome or in north
              Antrim. The two DUP members of the Executive have resiled from
              their Budget responsibilities. They want the best of both worlds.
              They want to stand outside the tent; yet they want to live in it.
              They want power without responsibility. They want the trappings of
              power without its responsibility and obligations. They have not
              returned their ministerial cars and they do not refuse their
              ministerial salaries and all the other perks that go with
              ministerial responsibility. &quot;Do not ever ask us to take
              responsibility&quot; is what they say. They want to follow their
              nice, comfortable, little middle track waving bye-bye to those who
              are carrying the responsibility for the process —<i>

              tourism, fisheries — and Ian&nbsp;Paisley Senior has just spoken
              about that — transport, roads, electricity, telecommunications
              and the harmonisation of taxes. We hear much from the DUP about
              fuel taxes, but it never attempts to promote harmonising these
              taxes. Fuel is just one example of the harmonisation of taxes.</p>

              that can be provided in those matters.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Budget has not fully explored the peace
              dividend. As I said at the outset, the Budget cannot and will not
              deal with all the neglect and deprivation that has existed in this
              part of Ireland for the past 30 years — and for the past 80 or
              90&nbsp;years. It makes no suggestions on how to deal with the
              dreadful poverty among young people, the old, students and the
              sick. These elements of the fabric of our society have been
              neglected in the past 30 years and they continue to be neglected.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget does not and cannot deal with those
              wants and needs in our society, as the money is not available.
              Those who wish to stay outside and those who wish to force others
              outside should stop playing games with the Executive and should
              develop a strategy to rectify the economic imbalance, the
              political discrimination and the social and economic deprivation
              in society.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive have a wonderful opportunity to
              set up an economic task force to project the additional moneys
              that will be needed to underpin the social and material
              infrastructure of our society for the next 10 or 15&nbsp;years.
              There is no reason why we should not approach the Irish Government
              to ask them to assist us. We should not approach them with a
              begging bowl but with a proposition that if they have an interest
              in reunification with this part of our island they have an
              obligation to assist in that reunification. There is no reason why
              we should not ask them to provide subvention and to assist us by
              putting money into the infrastructure of this part of Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The British Government and the Dublin
              Government are the two sovereign Governments with ultimate
              responsibility for this part of our island. There is no reason why
              the British Government should not be compelled to make amends for
              the economic deprivation that they have caused. This deprivation
              has not existed merely since partition; it existed for several
              hundred years before partition. There is no reason why they cannot
              be asked to provide subvention to help to secure a more stable
              economic and social future for this part of Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an American dimension. Bill Clinton,
              among others, has spoken of the 40 million people of Irish descent
              who live in America. That is another area that we ought to
              investigate to see whether we can secure subvention for and
              investment in this part of Ireland. We recall how the Americans
              implemented the Marshall Plan, which played a major part in
              rescuing Europe from the economic desolation of the second world
              war, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no reason for not going, like the
              Israelis, to America to launch a bond scheme. There is no reason
              for not, through the Executive, looking in a very imaginative way
              at launching a bond in America with the co-operation of the Irish
              and British Governments in an attempt to improve our financial
              situation over the next few years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A LeasCheann Comhairle, these are matters that
              the Executive could profitably explore in future. It could deal
              with the very serious underfunding in all Departments in this part
              of Ireland — in health and education, for example. Consider the
              condition of the roads west of the Bann. It was once the case that
              travelling through Cavan one could tell who lived where by the
              state of the fields or how good the land was. If one travels west

              state of the roads.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These matters can and must be dealt with. I
              know that it is difficult and I congratulate Mr Durkan on this
              Budget. It cannot have been easy for him. However, in designing
              and structuring a budget within our financial parameters he has
              made a worthy first attempt.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must look beyond the Barnett formula and
              beyond the technical formulations of the cold economic points that
              the Barnett formula tends to deal in. We must be adventurous and
              look beyond our own devices and our own shores.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Regional
              Development Committee (Mr McFarland):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Budget. I must admit to feeling a
              frisson of excitement, for this is our first chance to have a
              serious debate on an important issue without a time limit.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Departmental running costs were mentioned
              earlier, and in many cases the increase is confusing. In his
              speech the Minister said that the Executive must make realistic
              provision for them and that departmental running costs were
              originally underestimated. It was a substantial underestimation,
              and these rises could be more easily understood were it not for
              the extensive use in most Departments of consultants, outside
              study teams and panels. Members will easily recall the acute
              hospitals review. The Department for Regional Development has made
              extensive use of outside management consultants on the port of
              Belfast; there is also a regional strategy panel. Outside
              consultants can be found in all Departments, and if they are
              deciding policy and strategy — which they are — the question
              arises of what the Departments are doing and why they need the
              extra money for doing less.</p>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today we are asked to agree a Budget and to
              comment on how well the Departments have planned for next year.
              How many Members have been able to see how well Departments have
              stewarded their funds in the past year? Members may be interested
              to know that the latest published figures for the Department of
              Health are for the year 1997-98. Questions about this will be met
              with the reply that the accounts for subsequent years have not yet
              been officially audited. How can Members properly decide how much
              money a Department requires and whether such funds are justified
              in light of the Department’s past performance if we are denied
              this information? The Minister of Finance and Personnel should
              consider this problem, because it will be a more serious factor in
              the next Budget.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will know that I am a member of the
              Regional Development Committee. For several weeks the Minister has
              been warning the Committee and the Assembly that road improvements
              announced by his predecessor are in jeopardy. I have here a letter
              — addressed to my Colleague, Mr Hussey, and dated last Wednesday
              — that says, quite clearly, that some schemes may have to be
              deferred. The latest figures from the Department on major
              roadworks over £1 million are therefore confusing. It is
              interesting that in 2000-01 £24 million was allocated. The
              projects over £1 million amount to a £7 million spend. I am not
              clear where the other £17 million or so has gone. Next year is
              even more interesting: £60 million has been allocated, but on the
              list is a £28 million spend; we seem to have lost or got confused
              about £32 million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do not forget that the Minister has said that
              he does not have the funds to start these road projects. He has
              made great play of that. Can the Minister of Finance and Personnel
              confirm that the Minister for Regional Development has been
              guaranteed 90% funding for projects in years two and three and
              that once the public service agreements are in place that will
              increase to 100% funding? I understand that the Minister has been
              told that the funding is available, yet he tells us that he does
              not have this funding and therefore will not start the projects
              that were listed for the Assembly last week. That is very
              confusing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, these figures do not take into
              account Executive funds, which in year one are £7 million, £40
              million in year two and £100 million in year three for
              infrastructure funds. The Minister of Finance and Personnel told
              us last week that railways and roads are key areas of
              infrastructure that are eligible for bids under the Executive
              programme funds — supportive noises there from the Minister of
              Finance and Personnel. Could the Minister for Regional Development
              have been misleading the House on the availability of funds for
              his roads?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was struck by and agree with Mr Peter
              Robinson’s statement on the railways — they were indeed
              heading for oblivion. It was heartening to hear him recognise the
              benefits of the Belfast Agreement and of devolution — brought
              about on behalf of the Unionist community by the Ulster Unionist
              Party, with no contribution, of course, from his own party.
              Perhaps it highlights the hypocrisy of some here. You have heard
              them today urge the Executive to do this or that. Is this the
              party that was going to bring the Assembly down and destroy it? Is
              this the party that sat last Friday with Sinn Féin in Belfast
              City Council and produced a full budget for the council? Amazing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also a member of the Health Committee. The
              Minister of Finance and Personnel will be aware that the Health
              and Social Services Committee was unable to comment on the Budget.
              I mentioned the difficulty we experienced in obtaining figures.
              The NHS, despite valiant efforts on the part of its staff, is a
              disaster — £2·6 billion go in at one end while patients on
              trolleys and crises come out at the other. Funding is given to the
              boards; the boards allocate it to the trusts, and it sinks into
              the woodwork with a worsening output at the other end.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are the Ministers of Health and Finance and
              Personnel not curious about where all this money goes? If ever
              there was a case for a public service agreement and a radical
              examination of the administrative system, it is in the Department
              of Health. I trust that by next year we shall know exactly what
              happens to the funding available to that Department.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am struck by the opposition to the increase
              in the regional rate, which is in line with the Treasury’s
              advice, and by the number of councillors who have supported the
              amendments. Perhaps those Members who are also councillors should
              have informed the House of a potential conflict of interests. I
              support the substantive motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard a good deal about what is and
              what is not taking place in the Executive. I was pleased to hear
              the Minister describing the degree of co-operation between
              Ministers and Departments in drawing up the Budget.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I shall comment on the amendments,
              particularly the DUP’s. Anyone who has the remotest interest in
              tourism, trade, business, agriculture or health must vote against
              the DUP’s amendment. The only thing missing from its list is
              fresh air — we do not have control of that here yet, thank
              goodness.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am as baffled as Mr McGrady by the Sinn Féin
              amendment; he could not understand why Sinn Féin should oppose
              its Ministers’ stance. Under the provisions of the Budget, the
              Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety’s
              expenditure is to rise by 7·6% while a 10% increase in funding
              for personal social services is provided for. The Sinn Féin
              Ministers will not welcome their party Colleagues’ amendment if
              it removes the 7·6% and 10% funding increases. Similarly, there
              is to be a 7·2% increase in funding for the Department of
              Education, the deduction of which Mr McGuinness would not welcome.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am particularly interested in the Executive
              programme funds. I shall try to make my comments on this matter
              parochial rather than talk about billions of pounds. The Executive
              programme funds may soon be tested by the closure of the grazing
              lands in the Silent Valley as a result of a directive from the
              Minister of Health and an implementation of the ban by the
              Minister for Regional Development. After these had been closed,
              everyone ran to the Minister of Agriculture who, through no fault
              of her own, became the third Minister involved in the matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The loss experienced by farmers must be
              examined. This was not a one-off ban — it is to be repeated for
              the next three years until the new treatment plant at the Silent
              Valley reservoir is built. The Executive programme funds provide
              an opportunity for Ministers to discuss matters involving all
              Departments, and this is one case that meets those criteria.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, I welcome the £2 million for animal
              health. I have had a personal interest in this from the outset. I
              have never seen the sense in having two research centres and two
              different Governments working on animal health on the island of
              Ireland. Although there was some co-operation, it was not nearly
              enough. This £2 million will be welcome if it helps to reduce
              animal disease on the island of Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third subject, which I shall discuss
              briefly, is the Executive’s decision to increase their
              contribution to the free travel scheme from 50% to 75%. I recently
              asked the Minister of Health and the Minister for Social
              Development whether their respective Departments could fund the
              programme. I was disappointed in their response. At that point it
              would have meant dividing the balance of 50% between them. I was
              very disappointed and concerned that neither Minister saw the
              benefit. They said that it was not part of their remit to
              facilitate senior citizens by contributing to the scheme. I ask
              them to reconsider that proposition because I firmly believe that
              it could be slotted into their Departments. It is only 25% now —
              12·5% each. I believe that it would be difficult for them to
              refuse.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, an additional £2 million has been
              provided for Mr Campbell today. It is a Christmas box that he
              could use well. I am being seasonal in one sense — he could use
              that £2 million for a road gritting scheme for rural areas. After
              all, main roads also go through rural areas. There have been no
              gritting schemes for 10 to 12 years, and matters would be improved
              if the £2 million were spent on such a scheme. I do not look for
              billions. Those are a few simple ideas. Perhaps I am being
              parochial but I would welcome their being encompassed in the
              Budget.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Environment Committee
              (Rev Dr William McCrea):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I want to speak about some of the issues
              in the Budget in my role as Chairperson of the Environment
              Committee. I shall certainly let the House know when I am not
              speaking as that Committee’s Chairperson but on my own behalf as
              an elected representative.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Chairperson of the Environment Committee I
              wish to comment on the Budget’s provision for the Department of
              the Environment. The Committee welcomed the increase of 12% in
              direct funding for the Department and the possibility of an
              additional 2·3% from the retention of receipts by the Environment
              and Heritage Service and the Planning Service. This has gone some
              way towards redressing the underfunding of important environmental
              and conservation work that has been undertaken in recent years.
              However, the Minister will not be surprised to learn that several
              Budget allocations still cause my Committee concern.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee noted that a bid of £3·6
              million for essential work on landscape protection and nature
              conservation was not met. Can the Minister tell the House what
              account was taken of the consequences of missing this bid when the
              allocation of funding to Departments was considered?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee remains extremely concerned about
              the underfunding of historic buildings. The Committee welcomes the
              additional £1 million for this work, but I understand that this
              will not lift the moratorium. As a result, we shall lose funding
              that would be available from other sources. Will the Minister tell
              me what consideration was given to the effect that this may have
              on the built heritage? I hope that I do not have to remind the
              Minister or the Assembly that, like our landscape and natural
              heritage, once old buildings are lost they are lost for good, and
              we lose an important and irreplaceable part of our shared heritage
              and culture.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that the Minister will agree that much
              of the Department of the Environment’s work has important
              implications for everyone in Northern Ireland. Many issues cut
              across Departments, particularly the waste management strategy.
              Much of the implementation work on this strategy will fall on
              district councils. They will not be able to meet the cost of the
              work without an increase in funding or an increase in rates. Many
              district councillors are deeply worried by the financial
              implications of the rates — the district rate in particular —
              and the burden on ratepayers.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Additional funds have been made available to
              local councils in Great Britain, but not here. Why not? How can we
              hope to meet the vital targets for waste reduction and recycling
              in the strategy if they are not backed by the necessary money?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Department of the Environment fails to
              meet its obligations under EC Directives because it does not have
              the resources, which Department will meet the cost of any
              infraction proceedings? Will the Department of the Environment
              have to bear the cost because it did not have the necessary
              resources to put the structures and systems in place to meet its
              international obligations? It would be totally wrong not to make
              money available to it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My final observation as Chairperson of the
              Environment Committee is to note that the Budget figures for
              2002-03 and 2003-04 are indicative and are rounded to the nearest
              £10 million. They show an increase of almost £10 million for the
              Department of the Environment for both years. The Environment
              Committee welcomes the increase for the Department. Can the
              Minister confirm that the Department will benefit from that extra
              £10 million? If not, can he tell the Environment Committee and
              the Assembly what the real increase will be for 2002-03 and
              2003-04? This document clearly says that the figures will be
              rounded to the nearest £10 million. It shows £110 million for
              the Department of the Environment, so the nearest £10 million
              would be £120 million. That would be deeply appreciated by the
              Department.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to discuss other matters, speaking as a
              Member of the Assembly. We have received different signals from
              around the House today. I heard the Sinn Féin/IRA Member for Mid
              Ulster, Mr John Kelly, welcome Mr Durkan’s motion. He differs
              from his party, because it did not welcome the motion but moved an
              amendment to it. I am not sure what is happening — is there
              another division in Sinn Féin/IRA? On one hand it wants to amend
              the motion; on the other it welcomes it. Those were Mr John Kelly’s
              opening words. I am sure that it charmed Mr Durkan’s ears when
              he heard that he was to be supported by Sinn Féin/IRA.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr John Kelly went on to say that the DUP wants
              the best of both worlds. That is interesting. The two Sinn
              Féin/IRA Ministers were at the Executive meetings; they were
              party to the discussions and they agreed the programme. They now
              find that their party has cut the feet from under them by making
              an amendment. They would accept the motion subject to a reduction
              of expenditure in the Executive programme funds in order to lower
              the increase in the regional rate from 8% to the current level of
              inflation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What do they want? Does Sinn Féin/IRA want the
              best of both worlds so that it can pretend to ratepayers that
              somehow it robustly defended their interests in the Assembly? In
              the secret closets of the Executive meetings their Ministers
              raised their hands in agreement to it. There seems to be a
              disagreement. I know that other parties disagree; but in that
              party disagreeing can have serious consequences. It will be
              interesting to see how this pans out.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his defence of the Budget, the Minister said
              that an increase of 8% was justifiable because it would come from
              those who could afford to pay. I do not accept that. There is a
              major poverty trap in Northern Ireland that catches those whose
              wages are just above the minimum benefit level. They must pay for
              everything. It is they who cannot afford to pay. We find that
              instead of 2·9%, it will be 8%. This rate, as my hon Friend Mr
              Dodds said, is in line for several years to come — a constant
              8%. Of course, there were howls of objections to that —</p>

              attention of the House, to my injunction at the start of the
              debate. I trusted that when matters had been dealt with at
              substantial length earlier in the debate that Members would not
              repeat them. Many Members still wish to speak, and Members will
              have to be particularly creative and fascinating to get beyond 10
              minutes before I call the next Member. If each Member takes even
              10 minutes to speak, the debate will last for a very long time. I
              therefore ask Members not to exceed 10 minutes unless they are
              being particularly innovative in their ideas. I am listening
              acutely for that with all Members, not just with Dr McCrea.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to be treated differently from
              other Members. That rule of thumb has not been in use while I have
              been in the Chamber.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The Member has not been listening. At
              the start of the debate I said that I would not impose a time
              limit so that Members speaking at the start of the debate would
              have longer to speak. I wanted Members who spoke in the later part
              of the debate not to repeat what other Members had said earlier.
              For that reason, if the Member, as he will undoubtedly do, not
              only attends to what I say but to what I do with regard to other
              Members he will find equity.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept your ruling, Mr Speaker.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the 8% is at the heart of this issue
              and of the amendment, and I have not heard many Members deal with
              the Minister of Finance and Personnel’s statement on it. Very
              few have mentioned it or dealt with the claim that it will affect
              only those that can afford to pay. In fact, it will hurt those who
              are least able to carry the burden. In saying that, I am guided by
              the Minister’s statement. The burden is not placed upon those
              who can afford to pay the additional money; it is placed upon
              those who are in a very serious poverty trap. That is at the heart
              of the two amendments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that Members can speak to the
              amendments. The matter of the 8% is in both of them; it is
              topical, and rightly so. If there is a ruling that we do not deal
              with those matters, that we must deal with other matters, we shall
              have to consider carefully what we are supposed to say in the
              House.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland mentioned the budget for the
              Department for Regional Development and asked whether Mr Campbell
              was misleading the House. Mr McFarland knows that the Minister was
              not misleading the House. By making that cheap political point Mr
              McFarland may feel that he has done something in the debate to
              bring him some kudos. However, it is stupid and childish to talk
              about misleading the House on a very serious matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Getting money for the Province’s roads is a
              serious matter. Anyone who thinks that the money that the Minister
              has given is sufficient to repair the Province’s roads is
              mistaken. The Member must be in North Down and not in the rest of
              the country. The roads in Mid&nbsp;Ulster need a tremendous
              injection of finance. We want to ensure that we have enough money
              to build the Toome bypass and other vital roads in the area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He also mentioned the Executive programme
              funds. People used to talk about &quot;brown paper bags&quot;. Let
              us be frank: when people speak about Executive funding they mean
              the drip-feeding. When the Belfast Agreement gets into
              difficulties and the people do not see it as the way forward or do
              not agree with it, the First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister drip-feed another few million pounds into the community
              to keep the peasants quiet for another while.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Money for roads should go to the Department for
              Regional Development rather than into the central programme, where
              the Executive can interfere with a Department’s finances. The
              programme, which my hon&nbsp;Friend has laid out in the considered
              amendment and on which we have been upfront and open, states
              exactly where the money would come from. The sad reality is that
              the Alliance Party has no alternative and therefore could table no
              amendment. The DUP has tabled a clear and considered amendment,
              and I trust that the House will support it.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to raise some points without being
              repetitive. I acknowledge the many good things in the Budget and
              commend the Minister and the Executive for their hard work.
              However, I want to argue in favour of the amendment moved by my
              party Colleague Mr Maskey. I want to oppose the recommendation
              that the domestic regional rate should be increased by 8% in
              2001-02 and in subsequent years. I also want to oppose an increase
              of 6·6% in the non-domestic regional rate with lesser, but still
              significant, increases in subsequent years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall briefly argue the special circumstances
              west of the Bann, of Counties&nbsp;Tyrone and Fermanagh in
              particular, which require a special-case approach and the merits
              of an all-Ireland harmonisation programme. In effect, the opposite
              of the case articulated by Mr&nbsp;Dodds and his DUP Colleagues.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where is the much heralded peace dividend that
              we were told would flow abundantly from the British Chancellor’s
              coffers? Why should we oppose the increase in the regional rate?
              Because its impact would be much greater than the revenue it would
              raise. It is too much pain for too little gain. It amounts to
              double taxation and will have a crippling effect on already
              hard-pressed ratepayers, not least on those who are trying to make
              ends meet in small shops in towns such as Omagh, Strabane and
              Dungannon.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is high feeling, anger and resentment
              among traders in Omagh, for example, at being rated out of
              business. They suffer when competing with large, out-of- town
              multi-outlet retailers. It is bad for the economies of small towns
              and rural communities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why should I plead a special case for west of
              the Bann? Because things are not equal. People there ask why they
              should be subject to the same percentage increase in their rates
              when they are wrestling with the consequences of decades of
              underinvestment, neglect and discrimination; when they have
              inadequate access to quality health services; and when motorways
              end at Dungannon and just beyond Antrim. Poor roads infrastructure
              is a major disincentive for tourists and potential investors.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why should there be a uniform approach when
              uniformity does not exist, where service provision is not uniform,
              allocation of resources unequal, and where there is no level
              playing field? Inequality must be recognised and legislated for,
              even if that entails a two-tiered approach and some affirmative
              action or rebates for disadvantaged citizens and disadvantaged
              areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive could enter into a public service
              agreement with citizens living in disadvantaged rural areas west
              of the Bann to correct the huge imbalance in resources and
              underdevelopment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall not indulge in what the DUP calls
              &quot;North/ Southery&quot;. It is sufficient to assert the
              strength of the economy in the rest of Ireland, and the DUP,
              whether it likes it or not, is swimming against a very strong
              economic and historical tide. Looking at tourism, agriculture,
              industrial development and the knowledge-based economy, one can
              see that money spent on North/South development is money well
              spent. It is a progressive move and a sound investment for the
              future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ceann Comhairle’s invitation was to be
              innovative, and I shall be. One possible source of income has not
              dared to be spoken of today: the massive British military budget.
              Exact figures are difficult to unearth, but conservative estimates
              put the cost of maintaining Britain’s military garrison in
              Ireland at between £800 million and £1 billion per annum. I want
              to use a visual aid. It is a map of the Six Counties outlining the
              British military presence.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, I wish to speak about the Budget
              with regard to the needs and aspirations of the Ulster-Scots
              community in Northern Ireland and in east Donegal.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The McCann-Erickson identity survey found that
              22% to 23% of Ulster’s population are happy to describe
              themselves as Ulster-Scots, while more than 50% of those surveyed
              expressed a positive attitude towards the language in particular.
              These figures must be regarded as the baseline for Ulster-Scots,
              because a rising tide of interest and enthusiasm is spreading
              across Ulster-Scots cultural interests.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Conference in the Human Dimension of the
              Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe resolved that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;to belong to a national minority is a
              matter of a person’s individual choice and no disadvantage may
              arise from the exercise of such a choice.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More than 100,000 people in Ulster chose to
              identify themselves as Ulster-Scots, but this minority is being
              disadvantaged and this discrimination must end now.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the BBC gives Ulster-Scots cultural
              interests only inadequate coverage, the Ulster-Scots night on BBC2
              attracted an audience of more than 120,000. The last decade has
              seen a remarkable rise in interest in many Ulster-Scots cultural
              activities, but all this has taken place against a background of
              indifference, unfairness and outright discrimination.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The mainspring of the Ulster-Scots cultural
              renaissance is the Ulster-Scots language movement. The treatment
              afforded the Ulster-Scots illustrates graphically the
              discrimination and marginalisation to which the indigenous
              language of the Ulster people is subjected. It is vital that the
              Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure responds to the rising
              interest in the Ulster-Scots language in accordance with the
              principles of justice and equality.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Happily, we do not depend on local definitions
              of what may reasonably be thought to constitute fairness, justice
              and equality of treatment. Important markers laid down in Europe
              will establish a standard against which the treatment afforded to
              the Ulster-Scots language can be judged.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ulster-Scots has Part II status in the European
              Charter; that means that it is recognised as a regional minority
              language. The Irish language enjoys Part III status. This must not
              be used to justify discrimination or inequality of treatment. The
              Ulster-Scots community is not asking for preferential treatment,
              but it insists on equality because it aspires to Part III status.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Irish language benefited from a development
              programme wisely embarked upon by the de Valera Government. This
              development programme was ideologically driven. In contrast, we
              maintain that the Ulster-Scots movement is entirely apolitical.
              Nevertheless, we require a language development programme suitable
              for our specific regional needs and special circumstances. I
              welcome this opportunity to place before the House the undeniable
              claims of a people of genius, enterprise, industry, resilience and
              perseverance: the Ulster-Scots. They have often been inarticulate
              in the past but they have now found their voice through this
              Chamber and through the Ulster-Scots Agency of the North/South
              language body, tha Boord o Scotch, the establishment of which has
              at last created the conditions under which our community can grow
              strong.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Culture, Arts and
              Leisure Committee (Mr ONeill):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some said that we would never get this far.
              Well, here we are. We have a Government in place and a Programme
              for Government in the final stages of budgetary preparation.
              Sometimes we become too preoccupied with our internecine
              wranglings and miss the bigger picture. We have certainly made
              some progress.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development of the Budget has suffered from
              pressures of time and change. Many of those pressures are a result
              of changing from the traditional approach to a more equitable
              modern one. This is typified by the creation of the Executive
              programme funds, a very imaginative and innovative set of ideas
              approved by all the Ministers in the Executive. The Sinn Féin
              amendment is therefore all the more bizarre and unbelievable. If
              this amendment were made, which areas of the Executive programme
              funds would survive? What would be reduced and what would be
              abolished? A party moving a competent and responsible amendment at
              this stage of a budget should be required to outline any affect it
              might have. Sinn Féin has not done so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With a funding allocation of only £25 million
              in 2000-01, this amendment would wreck any chance the programme
              had of getting off the ground. We have heard about the many good
              things in the special funds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that we hear more about this
              amendment, although I do not see how we could accept such an
              amendment at this stage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP’s amendment has been accurately
              described as party political. I often think that our electorate is
              extraordinarily patient. What other electorate in the world would
              put up with the constant assault that the DUP has mounted on the
              overwhelming mandate given to the Good Friday Agreement, of which
              the cross-border bodies are an integral part? Its leader called
              today for a referendum and said that he would abide by the
              outcome. Why does he not abide by the other referendum on the Good
              Friday Agreement? Neither he nor his party has done so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interestingly, the special EU programmes also
              feature on the DUP hit list. The special EU programme provision
              is, of course, a cross-border programme — Peace II. Every party
              and almost every Member has supported not just its implementation
              but its early implementation according to need. Every party
              encouraged the establishment of the special European programme
              body to administer that fund. And — guess what? — the DUP has
              appointed a member to that board. It has appointed an Assembly
              Member — Mr William Hay from the constituency of Foyle — to
              that board, and I am glad to see him in the Chamber. No sensible
              Member could possibly support this kind of self-contradiction and
              inconsistency.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having made those general points, I have been
              asked to express some concerns on behalf of the Committee that I
              chair. Although recognising the Minister’s difficulty in
              producing a sensible Budget — and that has been well achieved in
              the circumstances — we must put these concerns on record.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, we were concerned because for several
              years the areas that comprise the Department of Culture, Arts and
              Leisure have suffered disproportionate underfunding. There was
              therefore a strong argument for giving them special consideration.
              Unfortunately, only 25% of our additional bids were met.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our concerns about the ability to buy out the
              commercial fishing nets around Northern Ireland’s coastline have
              already been referred to the Minister, and he knows our views.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are also concerned that the arts bid has
              only been met in part. Obviously, we should have liked greater
              emphasis placed on that. Also — and this is a very interesting
              and important point — no funding was included in the Budget for
              safety improvements to motorcycle racing facilities. As Members
              will remember, that has been the subject of much debate in our
              Committee and in the Department. All Members believe that it must
              be attended to. Clearly, that has disappointed the Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it would be ungracious of me not to
              recognise that there is more money for libraries and for the
              languages of the North/South cross-border body, and that will help
              enormously.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Considering our difficulties, the changes that
              we want to make and the innovations that we want to introduce, we
              have made a great start.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members should not be disappointed if their
              demands are not satisfied in the first round. We shall go from
              strength to strength. Who would have believed five years ago that
              we would now be considering the final stages of a budget for the
              programme of a new Government for Northern Ireland? In five years’
              time, how well honed will the new arrangements be? We shall be
              able to deal more efficiently with many of the problems raised
              today.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Education
              Committee (Mr S Wilson):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, I shall obey your injunction not to
              go over points that have already been made about the Budget and
              why the DUP moved its amendment. The arguments against the SDLP’s
              stealth tax have been well made.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to deal with the points made by some of
              the other parties about our amendment. As usual, Mr Close brought
              a bit of life to the debate, although the arguments that he made
              were more or less dead. He opposed the amendment without moving
              one of his own. He said that he was being accused of taking a
              populist stance. No one could accuse the Alliance Party of being
              populist; &quot;populist&quot; implies that a party has a wee bit
              of support for its views.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close was also described as a magician,
              although he did not conjure up an amendment. Time and time again
              his party has lectured my party on being &quot;negative&quot; and
              on the need to offer an alternative. He was asked why he did not
              move an amendment, but no answer was forthcoming. I was intrigued
              by some of his reasoning: first he said that he could not move an
              amendment because the regional rate was a serious point of
              principle. Surely if the 8% increase in the regional rate were
              such a serious point of principle an alternative would have been
              offered. His fall-back position was that the voting system in the
              House was so rotten that it was not worth his while to move an
              amendment. His party supported that voting system. He objected —
              and I liked this bit — to his party’s being designated
              &quot;Other&quot;. That intrigued me.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Education Committee discussed a document on
              the viability of integrated schools. The Alliance Party’s
              submission described the present system of dividing people into
              Catholics and Protestants as unfair and called for a third
              category. What was that category to be called? Why
              &quot;Other&quot;! The Alliance Party objects to being called
              &quot;Other&quot; in the House and will not even table an
              amendment to the Budget because it is so indignant about it.
              However, it wants those attending integrated schools to be able to
              call themselves &quot;Other&quot;. Mr&nbsp;Close said that he was
              sick of sectarian labels, although the Alliance Party’s proposal
              for integrated schools suggested that we could have
              &quot;Others&quot; from a predominantly Protestant background and
              &quot;Others&quot; from a predominantly Roman Catholic background.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the party that hates being labelled and
              that will not table an amendment because the voting system in the
              House labels it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even more intriguing was Sinn Féin’s
              position. It said that the DUP’s amendment was an assault on the
              Good Friday Agreement; that it was party political and an attack
              on &quot;North/Southery&quot;. At least we were clear about what
              we were doing. Sinn Féin does not have a clue about what it is
              doing. We heard three or four speeches in the House today, some of
              which moved an amendment. Sinn Féin does not want the 8%
              increase. We then had a most articulate contribution from Mr John
              Kelly. If he had cut the &quot;camcorder&quot; out of it he would
              have halved his speech. In that highly articulate speech he
              actually welcomed the Budget. It seems that there are divisions in
              IRA/Sinn Féin. There are those who give &quot;real&quot; support
              to the Budget — the two Ministers, because they must have agreed
              to it; there are those who give &quot;provisional&quot; support to
              the Budget by giving it a qualified welcome; and there are those
              who give it &quot;continuing&quot; support, because they say they
              that they do not mind the 8%’s being imposed in future. They are
              in a bit of a tizzy about it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that Mr Billy Bell is here. He was
              speaking at a difficult time. The Ulster Unionist Party’s
              contributions all had the common theme of supporting the Budget
              and of attacking the Departments held by DUP Ministers. Billy Bell
              had a difficult task. First, he was trying to defend the
              indefensible; secondly, he was trying to do it before dinner time.
              I wondered at one point whether it was William Bell or dinner
              bell, because everyone seemed to rise to leave as he was speaking.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was amazed at the Ulster Unionist Party’s
              contributions; I am even more amazed that some contributions have
              not yet been made. There was certainly no vigorous defence of the
              Budget. Time and time again I have heard members of the Ulster
              Unionist Party speak about the iniquity of the regional rate. I
              have heard them in Belfast City Council. Some of them are
              Ministers who must have supported the Budget. They are not here.
              They spoke more eloquently and more robustly than ever I did in
              condemning the Labour Government for imposing the 8% increase in
              the regional rate. It used to be said that while we in the
              councils sought to keep rates within inflation, the direct rule
              Administration imposed high rates increases upon us. The same
              people now support that increase, but they are not in the House to
              explain themselves.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One Member who is not here — and I shall be
              interested to see how he votes — is Mr Cobain, the Chairperson
              of the Social Development Committee. He has spoken previously in
              the House in support of the poor. He has described this as a
              middle-class Budget for middle-class people. I should like to have
              heard his comments; I should like to know how he will vote.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paddy Roche accused DUP Ministers of writing a
              blank cheque. We have a blank seat, as we usually do, in his case.
              He never comes to hear me upbraid him. Given his opposition to the
              Budget, will he be here to vote against it? That will probably be
              a signal for him to come in to do precisely that. He certainly did
              not get it right because he said that it was impossible for people
              who had taken ministerial positions to mount credible opposition,
              as they had to support the decisions of the Executive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He usually reads from a prepared script, but
              today he tried to ad-lib. I am sure that you were pleased by that,
              Mr Speaker. Unfortunately, in ad-libbing he missed the facts. If
              he had been reading from a prepared script or if he had looked at
              the Northern Ireland Act 1998 he would have seen that Ministers
              only have to operate in the Programme for Government when it has
              been agreed in the Executive Committee and authorised by the
              Assembly. No Minister is committed merely because it has gone
              through the Executive Committee, whether there was a DUP Minister
              present —</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. A script is no guarantee of facts or
              accuracy. Time is passing. The Member will bring his remarks to a
              close.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whether they were in the discussions on the
              Budget or outside, as our Ministers were, they are not committed.
              If Mr Roche shows his face for the vote, he will see how bound the
              DUP Ministers are by this Programme for Government and Budget
              proposals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall sit down in a moment although I had a
              few things more to say. This amendment should have the support of
              the House. It should have the support of those in the Ulster
              Unionist Party who tell us that they have a social conscience. The
              money should be spent on the people who count rather than on
              &quot;North/Southery&quot;.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should declare at the start of the debate
              that I am a councillor. I have no difficulty in differentiating
              between the work I do as a Member and what the Executive does. I
              had no part in what the Executive, in its wisdom, decided with
              regard to the Budget. Parts of it were, I am sure, not considered
              in the round. One of them is the rating system. Councillors are
              more acutely aware of that than anyone else.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The British Government should pay the extra
              money. It is a small amount, about £20 million. Someone said that
              it was insignificant; but it is significant to ratepayers and
              retailers in Fermanagh, where many are finding it difficult to
              survive. Some of the retailers may not be small, but they bear the
              major part of the 8% rise on top of annual increases.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps my own county is not in the same dire
              straits as some others that are trying to deal with the rise. Some
              areas will face much more than that this year and next year. It is
              unfair to burden ratepayers who cannot do anything about the
              predicament faced by business in their areas. Business is bad in
              some rural areas, and businesspeople are being asked to pay a
              significant amount of money. This Budget seems to depend on
              ratepayers paying such significant amounts.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should have told the British Government to
              increase the block grant, which has been underfunded and reduced.
              We could raise the 8% here only to find that the British
              Government does not replace it in future and makes it a saving
              from the Exchequer. That is a possibility.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is room for major savings in all
              Departments. It would not be hard to save £20 million. Farmers
              can see where major savings could be made in the expenses of
              Departments with which they are involved. The Barnett formula is
              another example. We must deal with people who talk about being
              treated equally. Unionists are not treated equally here, although
              they talk about equality with the rest of the UK, as they call it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The British Government have saved billions of
              pounds from the conflict budget, yet they do not reinvest that
              money in an economy that they have ruined. Unionists can hardly
              regard that failure to reinvest as equal treatment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Costs here are much higher than in England;
              electricity, for example, is much more expensive, and that affects
              people who must deal with cuts every day of the week. Those are
              our problems. We should not ask those people to come up with the
              money. It may be insignificant in the overall Exchequer funding
              from the British Government, but it is very significant locally.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cross-border bodies are a vital part of the
              Good Friday Agreement. They are essential to the running of our
              island economy. Anyone with any business sense must admit that
              Ireland must be run as one island. Those who oppose it do so for
              purely political reasons; they know that it is not practical to
              work without cross-border co-operation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An addition of £7·6 million has been made to
              the health budget. Will it be used to replace some of the
              gynaecological services that have been removed from the Erne
              Hospital? Other services, such as mental health day care, have
              been removed or are underfunded — not by very large amounts but
              by a few thousand. Many people depend on that, but the boards have
              not come up with it. The trusts blame the boards, but local people
              suffer because the money has not been drawn down. I seek the
              necessary extra funding.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Travel for the elderly is grand, but those in
              rural areas with very little rail or public transport will not
              gain by it. It suits cities, but we shall be asked to contribute
              to it without benefiting from it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
              Development has received an extra £2 million for the LEADER
              programme and for disease control, both of which consist largely
              of administration. Its budget has been increased to £192 million,
              as well as £2 million and modulation money for farmers. What will
              the Department do with it all? How much of it is directed to
              Department administration rather than being drawn down to farmers?
              Farmers will have great difficulty in seeing its effect on farms.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget does not provide for any of the
              schemes that we asked for: the environmental scheme, installation
              aid for young farmers, Department of Agriculture and Rural
              Development equality schemes, the vision groups and an increase in
              animal disease compensation. Although it may be necessary to help
              disease control at first, that budget would fall if effective
              disease control were achieved. How effective has the eradication
              of brucellosis or tuberculosis been if such increases are
              necessary? It is vital that these funds be properly and
              effectively used rather than exploited, which may happen.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture’s
              administration budget is being increased while many can no longer
              afford to remain in farming. That is indeed a stark contrast. Will
              the extra money be eaten up in administration; will nothing be
              directed to farmers? Modulation funding is farmers’ money, but
              they have no say in where it goes. They are asked to pay yet they
              get no return. It starts at 2·5% in the first year and increases
              to 4·5% year on year for the next two years, yet farmers have no
              say in where it goes.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The effect that the increase of the £26
              million as well as the £7 million and the modulation money will
              have over the next two years is questionable. BSE is still mainly
              to blame for farmers’ predicament. They will not be allowed to
              use meat-and-bone meals, and that will create an extra expense for
              farms. They are not allowed to use it now in feeds because the
              United States used genetic modification in the production of soya,
              and retailers will no longer accept it. Therefore, farmers must
              look elsewhere. How can quality beef schemes be implemented, given
              the farmers’ situation? That will become clearer in the weeks to
              come.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The money that has been given to the electronic
              portal and to farm business development may benefit farmers, and I
              hope that it solves their problems. How much of the Budget has
              been designed to help farmers out of their difficulties — the
              stress and financial problems of having to go to the banks to
              restructure loans? The Budget must deal with that, but that may be
              the decision of individual Ministers and not of Mr Durkan.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, I am sure you will be relieved that
              at this time of night I have thrown away the Irish and
              Ulster-Scots versions of my speech. However, you will not be
              surprised to know that I cannot miss the opportunity to start by
              discussing the regional rate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not propose to repeat everything. Those of
              us in this corner of the Chamber who talk about the need for
              tax-varying powers are frequently criticised by Ministers who
              oppose that principle. However, even Sammy Wilson adopted Mr Close’s
              terminology and referred to the introduction of a &quot;stealth
              tax&quot;. Of course, the major benefits are that, first, it is
              not seen and, secondly, if it is seen, the councils get the blame.
              I must warn the Minister that the councils are starting to fight
              back.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No doubt he has plenty to read: he may read the
              Derry papers but not necessarily the ‘Coleraine Chronicle’
              every week. I draw his attention to an article in the edition of
              21 November. A motion proposed by Alliance councillor Bill
              Matthews expressing concern at the rates rise and asking the
              council to write to the Minister of Finance and Personnel, the
              First Minister and the Deputy First Minister was passed
              unanimously. Interestingly, among the councillors reported as
              having spoken on the issue was a Cllr Dallat, whom I see nodding
              to the Minister. <i>[Interruption.]</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DUP Members should wake up. They are a bit
              slow.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cllr Dallat expressed some very interesting
              views, which I am sure Members wish to hear — they may inform
              SDLP Back-Benchers on the debate. To my knowledge, no correction
              was published in the edition of 28 November, so I presume that
              this is correct. Cllr John Dallat and Cllr Eamon Mullan agreed
              with the Alliance Party proposal. Cllr Dallat also reminded the
              council that this is a notional rise — 8% may not be the final
              figure. If we are worried about 8% it appears that there is a
              hotline straight from the council offices in Coleraine to the
              Department of Finance and Personnel in Bangor; it informs us that
              it will be March before we know the final figure. I hoped that the
              document the Minister presented to us and that we are debating
              today would give us the final figure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council unanimously accepted the Alliance
              Party’s position — a precedent I recommend to the Assembly on
              every occasion. Similarly, I was informed by the ‘Good Morning
              Ulster’ programme this morning that Mr Close was getting the
              credit for running a &quot;one-man campaign&quot; against
              excessive rises in the regional rate. It is clear from the
              reaction to it that the &quot;one-man campaign&quot; appears to
              have won the majority opinion in the Chamber. Clearly there is
              some unity on that point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All this has happened because the regional rate
              rise was shoved through. It is the bluntest possible tax, unless
              the Minister is proposing to introduce the poll tax next year. All
              that has been gained is about £10 million for next year, a sum
              that will be well covered by the increases in departmental running
              costs across the 10 — or is it 11? — Departments. I can never
              remember which.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, it could be covered by what I
              understand to be a significant underspend in the Assembly’s
              running costs this year; money that can presumably be reallocated.
              It is time that the Minister told us whether he intends to play
              catch up with the council tax in England and Wales — or
              Yorkshire and Humberside, if those are the regions to which we are
              compared. If he does propose to play catch up, for how many years
              — not just the three years in this plan — must we have an
              excessive rise in the regional rate to facilitate it? Is that fair
              to those who are only slightly above the poverty line in Northern
              Ireland?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Free travel for pensioners also impinges on the
              rates. We used to complain in the bad old days of direct rule that
              Ministers made commitments while councils had the job of
              implementing them without the necessary funding. I suppose that we
              should be grateful for getting three quarters of the funding.
              However, the other 25% will lie as a charge upon the district
              rates. The Minister of the Environment has cut the district rate
              as part of his rates support grant, which is being funded by an
              increase in the regional rate. That is toytown economics — it
              does not add up.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public service agreements were referred to but
              not dealt with. The Budget proposes including them for each
              Department. Obviously, we welcome the greater accountability in
              delivering Government services. However, it is a clear example of
              putting the cart before the horse. We ought to have had a
              Programme for Government first. We should have costed it, and then
              we could have had public service agreements followed by a budget.
              Instead, it is being driven in the wrong direction. In referring
              to &quot;Departments&quot; the statement is unclear whether it
              means the 10 statutory Departments or the 11 effective Departments
              — the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
              seems to have an ever greater say. Will the agreements apply to
              the whole public sector? How will they be introduced? Into whose
              bailiwick will the enforcement of public service agreements fall?
              Are they a matter for the Department of Finance and Personnel? Is
              the Minister of Finance and Personnel being put up to speak on
              them for the Executive when they are yet another matter being
              centralised in the economic policy unit of the Office of the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, there is talk there about value for
              money. We all know that we have limited resources — limited not
              least because of the refusal to consider tax-varying powers. We
              all know what has happened in Northern Ireland over recent years
              with the introduction of the private finance initiative (PFI) and
              the change to public- private partnerships (PPPs), which seem
              merely to change a few initials without changing the principles
              very much. The Minister is well aware from the Adjournment debate
              a few months ago that I do not entirely oppose the concept of PPPs.
              Indeed, I can see benefits for the Antrim town centre development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it is time for the Executive to tell
              us their proposals on them. Will they repeat the disastrous
              mistakes made with PFI on aspects of public services that did not
              sit well with the private management of public services? I have in
              mind the kind of problems that have arisen in hospitals, and in
              the Health Service generally, in parts of Great Britain. Given the
              problems of funding Translink —the railways, Ulsterbus and
              Citybus — will there be a proposal to sell it off? Will the
              Executive tell us soon about the virtues of private profit in
              maintaining rail safety or will they wait until the Hatfield news
              fades a little?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time for the Executive to make proposals
              that are more than a pale imitation of Gordon Brown’s. For
              example, it could consider the proposal for a bonds issue; that is
              attracting considerable support with regard to the London tube. We
              should take a more imaginative look at leasing rather than accept
              the threat, which is implicit in how value for money is presented,
              that privatisation is the only option.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed amendments, apart from adopting
              the Alliance Party’s views on regional rates, seem to have
              different flavours. The DUP amendment opposes North/ South bodies.
              Interestingly, it has also chosen to drag in the Civic Forum. It
              is unlikely to attract support from across the Assembly — and
              certainly not from my party — in its attempt to put its
              political point into the Budget.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin has chosen to attack the Executive
              programme funds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That surprises me. We must take a more
              imaginative look at this, although not, I hope, as imaginative a
              look as Mr McElduff’s. The Executive programme funds are very
              different from the old direct rule proposals. They are an
              opportunity to make progress. Although it remains to be seen how
              well they work — they certainly do not attract carte blanche
              approval yet — they should at least be given a chance. We shall
              not support a proposal to remove money from the Executive
              programme funds as the only way of keeping the regional rate down.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone knew from the beginning that the DUP
              would try to distance itself from the Executive as soon as it took
              its seats there. I find it bizarre that, although Sinn Féin
              participates fully in the Executive, its Members did their best to
              distance themselves from Executive policy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the whole, the Minister has got off lightly
              with his Budget proposals because of the proposed increase in
              public expenditure across the United Kingdom. This may have more
              to do with the prospects of a Westminster general election than
              with the needs of the Assembly. However, the Budget has
              demonstrated the failure of the Executive to set priorities. I did
              not support devolution merely to have a pale imitation of Gordon
              Brown’s policies implemented without real regard for our society’s
              needs. I certainly did not want a Budget that would lead to a
              sectarian dogfight. The Assembly should get away from such
              sectarianism and cheap motives. I appeal to Members to do the
              right thing and say &quot;The Budget as it stands is not
              acceptable; it does not meet our constituents’ needs. It should
              be opposed&quot;.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Agriculture
              Committee (Mr Savage):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome Northern Ireland’s first Budget in
              30 years. Local people are delivering a way forward in difficult
              times. The acid test of any legislative Assembly is its financial
              clout. Representative bodies are often judged by the potency of
              their spending power. The result of the Assembly’s spending
              power has been a concentration of much effective decision making
              in local hands.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, one great question lies unresolved at
              the heart of Mr Durkan’s Budget. It is a question to which the
              Ulster Unionist Party would like an answer. I refer to the Barnett
              formula, which governs our relationship with the sovereign
              Parliament at Westminster or, more accurately, with the Treasury
              in Whitehall. The Treasury is known for its meanness; and the
              present incumbent of the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s office is
              noted for a canny approach to public spending characteristic of
              his Scottish prudence. Coincidentally, of course, this has
              resulted in a massive war chest, which the Labour Government will
              use through public spending to attract voters at the next general
              election.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time to deal with the Barnett formula
              properly, using all the emphasis that the Assembly can muster. I
              note that point 35 of the Minister’s statement on 12 December
              says</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Executive remains determined to
              engage with the Treasury&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">on the Barnett formula. Our approach must be
              more formal and more aggressive. The Assembly must formally
              address Her Majesty’s Government and the sovereign Parliament in
              Westminster, because they govern the relationship between the
              Assembly and the Executive and the Westminster Parliament and the
              Government of the day in the only issue that really matters —
              finance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Minister’s statement of 12 December I
              read with mounting concern that the practical effects of the
              Barnett formula are on European Union funding. Only one European
              Union programme, Peace II, is outside the operation of the Barnett
              formula. This is the only money that we receive directly from
              Europe. In paragraph 14 of his statement last Monday the Minister
              detailed the extra financial burden that he must meet in order to
              deliver the contents of European Union programmes effectively and
              appropriately. There is an extra £15 million in 2000-01, an extra
              £20 million in 2001-02 and an extra £20 million in 2002-03. That
              is £55 million over the next three fiscal years. This should not
              be. Those community programmes were designed to meet identified
              needs.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whitehall should not be pocketing the money for
              itself, yet that in effect is what is happening. The Minister
              agrees with this — he said as much in paragraphs&nbsp;14, 34 and
              35. Clearly, the operation of the Barnett formula irks him, as it
              does any right-thinking person. The Minister should tell us
              whether this European slippage is the only adverse effect of the
              Barnett formula. The key issue must be, of course, how much the
              loss of money through Barnett reduces our effective spending
              power.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our approach to dealing with this matter should
              be formal rather than causal. The issues must be publicly and
              transparently aired. After all, Mr Blair’s Government often
              tells us of the need for transparency — let us now see some of
              it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to comment on the additional money, some
              £2&nbsp;million above the figure given by the Minister in
              October, which is being allocated to the Department of Agriculture
              and Rural Development. In a statement on 12&nbsp;March the
              Minister said that the money was to be used for animal health
              programmes. No one disputes the importance of those programmes,
              but, as I have said before and will say again, the Department of
              Agriculture and Rural Development is much too consumer- orientated
              — it should be more producer-orientated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The additional money should be used to tackle
              the real drop in rural development spending that augments so many
              farm incomes. This is at a time when the incomes of farmers and
              fishermen are dropping steeply — a point I made in a debate on
              the agriculture industry two weeks ago.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only last week we heard about the severe cuts
              in the fishing quotas. This is the latest serious blow to an
              industry already reeling from disasters. For every fisherman who
              works on a boat another five are employed elsewhere in the
              industry. We must have equity across the whole agriculture and
              fisheries sector. We must also do something about farm incomes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only subheadings in the Budget which I can
              see effecting farmers’ incomes are &quot;Food &amp; Farm
              Policy&quot; and &quot;Domestic Agriculture Policy&quot;. Together
              they represent about £55&nbsp;million — only a quarter of the
              Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s total budget.
              That means that more than three quarters of the Department’s
              budget is being spent on administration and not directly on
              farmers’ incomes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is where the real crisis is. We must
              tackle new issues with new money and not continue to do more of
              the same. That is the essence of the proactivity spoken of in the
              agriculture motion unanimously agreed in the House on
              5&nbsp;December. Three things that people want are a reasonable
              education, a good job and to be able to own their own home. We
              politicians must create an environment where those things are
              possible. Farmers, farm workers and fishermen should not be
              excluded or ignored.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section&nbsp;2 on key Budget messages mentions
              an increase in health spending. We are all aware of the
              overcrowding in our hospitals and we are very lucky not to have
              been hit by an epidemic. Other important features are an increase
              of nearly 10% for agriculture and rural development, railways,
              provision for the first phase of the investment needed to make the
              network safe and action on vital environmental measures.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are only a few of them. I believe that
              the 8% increase can be spent wisely on important services that
              affect our everyday life, such as our hospitals and schools. I do
              not like the 8% increase; but if it can make a real difference
              where it matters it will be welcome. Those matters must be
              tackled. I hope that, as the Assembly makes progress and if the
              Budget is passed today, they will not be brushed under the carpet.
              They are real issues that affect us all.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not every week that the Alliance Party in
              Coleraine has an initiative, so it would be remiss of me to ignore
              it. It does have occasional initiatives on money. The debate in
              Coleraine took place before the Minister of Finance and Personnel
              announced an extra £31·7 million for Departments to achieve
              goals that I passionately believe in — goals that Mr Ford and
              his Colleagues in the Alliance Party have no time for. It is a
              shame that the Alliance Party wants to turn its back on the
              socially deprived. Where is its vision for a future in which all
              people will be equal?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party motion was penned in one of
              the most affluent electoral wards in Coleraine, a town that also
              has the poorest electoral ward in Northern Ireland. On that
              matter, I rest my case without apology.</p>

              The Speaker is now outside party politics and has scrupulously
              maintained that position. He does not have any statements from
              inside or outside the Chamber to which other Members can refer, as
              has been the case here.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, that was an historical reference.
              The proposals in the Budget reflect broad agreement among the main
              parties and reflect how the Assembly should spend its money over
              the next year. This is by any yardstick an historic occasion, as
              it represents the end of 30 years of direct rule and the
              disadvantages of absentee landlords. It also represents the
              beginning of direct accountability for how money is targeted, how
              it is spent and how waste can be avoided. I shall return to that
              when I speak in my role as Chairman of the Audit Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be much disagreement, but that is in
              the nature of politics. Nevertheless, all Members must be honest
              with themselves and, more importantly, with the electorate in
              outlining where money can be saved if they believe that a
              particular Department should be prioritised. Last Friday, the
              Minister of Further and Higher Education, Training and Employment,
              Dr Seán Farren, announced his proposals on fees and other aspects
              of support for part and full-time students in further and higher
              education.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The package received broad agreement from the
              Executive and general approval in the wider community. Some
              matters must be clarified over the next few weeks, and I have no
              doubt that they will be. However, when the Further and Higher
              Education, Training and Employment Committee discussed the package
              of reforms I was taken aback by a remark of a Sinn Féin member.
              He told us that he was not concerned about the views of his
              Colleagues in the Executive, Bairbre de Brún and Martin
              McGuinness, who helped to approve the package.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not mean to tell tales on the hon Member
              for Mid Ulster: he has already said that there are no pontiffs in
              Sinn Féin; nor do I wish to rubbish his independence as a
              Back-Bencher. I raise the matter to illustrate how strange it is
              to make demands that all of us could and would support in an ideal
              world but which cannot be delivered while funds are finite. In
              such circumstances it is right and proper that scarce resources be
              targeted at the socially disadvantaged. How can a budget ever be
              agreed if everyone does his own thing?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I do not share the political views of
              Minister de Brún or of Minister McGuinness, I am very concerned
              that they should have the resources to fund their Departments just
              as I want Dr&nbsp;Farren to have adequate funding for student
              finance. I hold the same view with regard to every other Minister,
              including the two absentee Ministers of the DUP. I take no
              pleasure in reading about Gregory&nbsp;Campbell’s being stuck in
              a snowstorm on the Glenshane Pass or stuck in a traffic jam in
              Toomebridge.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Returning to health and education, I do not
              want to see a repeat of an incident last week when one of my sick
              elderly constituents had to be transferred by private car from
              Altnagelvin Hospital to Coleraine Hospital because there was no
              ambulance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to see an end to the serious problems of
              poor literacy and poor numeracy, which, according to the latest
              provisional figures, are getting worse. Can anyone justify the
              fact that one in four people leaves school with serious problems
              in reading and counting? I think not. Term workers in schools who
              are not paid during holidays and who cannot receive benefits face
              problems. I want to see those problems resolved. I want that
              section of support staff to enjoy stability so that the children
              who need them most are not disadvantaged.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we make demands and roar from rooftops or
              from open-deck buses let us keep in mind that while resources are
              scarce we have a duty to target social need and to protect the
              rights of the poor. We also have a duty to view the big picture
              when the resources are not adequate to meet everyone’s demands.
              By and large, the Executive have done that in an equitable manner
              in spite of the unacceptable behaviour of the DUP, whose Ministers
              refuse to participate in the Executive. It seems strange —
              puzzling even — that any individual should abandon the
              principles of equality and targeting social need. I consider these
              principles to be much more important than any others that we may
              wish to see implemented when resources are more plentiful.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘Making a difference’ is a fundamental
              theme of the Programme for Government to which the Executive are
              committed. That difference will be seen in the proposals contained
              in the Budget for the services for which the Executive and,
              ultimately, the Assembly are responsible as we decide upon the
              allocation of the resources available. That difference must be
              measured against new targeting social need (New TSN) and equality
              requirements, which are fundamental to the Good Friday Agreement.
              In practice, they oblige us to target the needs of the poor. In
              other words, the needs of the poor must have priority when we
              allocate funds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also make our allocations with due
              regard to the equality provisions of section&nbsp;75 of the
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland Act 1998. This means ensuring that we not
              only avoid discrimination on the grounds of religion, politics,
              gender, race or disability, but that we actively promote equality.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP amendment is not worthy of serious
              debate and the Sinn Féin amendment is also disappointing. The
              Executive programme funds are a product of devolution. They allow
              us to get more out of the Government by making Departments more
              accountable for their expenditure and by forcing them to be more
              imaginative when they seek funding. The Executive programme funds
              are about giving back to the people what the Government have taken
              away in the past. These amendments are informed more by the
              writings of Robert Louis Stevenson’s ‘Dr&nbsp;Jekyll and
              Mr&nbsp;Hyde’ than by serious and responsible representative
              politics. One cannot accept power without accepting
              responsibility. It appears that Sinn Féin and the DUP want, just
              as the literary character did, to live one life inside Government
              and another outside it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Maskey proposed taking resources out of
              the Executive programme funds. He suggests that we remove
              resources designed to tackle social exclusion, to deal with the
              needs of our children, to regenerate rural and urban communities
              and to improve public services. I am not prepared to see
              priorities that have been neglected over 30&nbsp;years of direct
              rule put on the back burner once again.</p>

              must be an holistic approach to the spending of scarce resources,
              and that means that not everyone will be happy. That does not
              mean, however, that improvements cannot be made, that better ways
              of delivering services cannot be found; that is the task of
              Assembly Members, individually and collectively. It does not mean
              that I do not aspire to the abolition of fees or that I cannot
              work towards that as an individual or collectively with other
              Members.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Public Accounts Committee or the
              Audit Committee that I referred to earlier may have to ask for
              funds to finance extra scrutiny.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is interesting to follow Mr Dallat. He spent
              the first three or four minutes of his speech apologising for how
              he voted on the rates in the Higher and Further Education,
              Training and Employment Committee and in his local council. I hope
              that tonight, after one of our longest debates, he will know
              exactly how he is supposed to vote and will not make any mistakes
              for which he will later have to apologise. I also hope that he
              tells Dr Farren who Mr Robert Louis Stevenson is. In a recent
              radio interview the Minister seemed to be unaware of some of the
              literary giants to whom Mr Dallat referred.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members are also members of local
              authorities. Whenever a council set a scrupulously low council
              rate it wrote to the relevant Minister asking him not to take
              advantage of that to strike a high regional rate. I understand
              that Mr Durkan, when a member of his local council, followed that
              practice. I hope that tonight he will hear the plea of the people
              and accept that we should not take advantage of low council rates
              to set a high regional rate. I support wholeheartedly the comments
              of my Colleagues, the Members for North Belfast, Mr Dodds, and
              East Belfast, Mr Peter Robinson, who moved the amendment. The
              amendment shows that some cuts could be made to the Budget to
              untie the Minister’s hands and to put the money into a better
              budget.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also listened to the whingeing of several
              IRA/Sinn Féin Members; it serves absolutely no purpose. Mr John
              Kelly, the Member for Mid Ulster, opposed the DUP’s argument on
              &quot;North/Southery&quot; and our objections to spending money on
              the North/South bodies. Of course, Mr Kelly’s party and its
              other wing — the Provisional IRA — have for several years been
              engaged in cross- border activities. One of the most recent was
              blowing up the heart of Omagh, killing 29 people. On several other
              occasions the IRA executed people and fled across the border.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must object to the bloodthirstiness at the
              heart of Sinn Féin’s cross-border policy. Its members read us a
              homily about supporting cross-border initiatives, although their
              party has used the border to hide from justice. That is a sick
              joke, and everyone will see through it. However, the hypocrisy of
              Sinn Féin Members caps it all. They are first in line with the
              begging bowl, asking for watchtowers to be ripped down and asking
              the British Government to stop spending on security for the people
              of Northern Ireland. Their hypocrisy is blatant.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget is really all about who gets what
              and what they do with it. No one underestimates the difficulty of
              the Minister’s task, but it would be irresponsible to give him a
              lap of honour and to heap praise on him when there are still
              serious problems with his Budget.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget has totally failed to stop the waste
              that lies at its own heart. We are all aware of the waste on the
              part of some Departments, namely Health and Education. We all know
              that every month the Health Minister wastes approximately £2,500
              on completely unnecessary duplication and translation costs. We
              all received the Health Department’s ‘Building the Way Forward
              in Primary Care’ document this week; it had been translated and
              published in Irish. How much did that cost? How much more waste of
              resources will the Executive tolerate before they stop it at their
              own heart?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same Minister wasted £3,300 on a
              non-existent cross-border meeting in Enniskillen; money should not
              have been wasted in such a manner. That Minister’s decision on
              maternity services is now subject to a judicial review; that is
              yet another waste of resources by her Department, for she took
              what was a blatantly political decision. Now she is wasting money
              on primary care publications.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This waste, this rottenness at the heart of
              government must be eradicated. It exposes Sinn Féin/ IRA’s real
              agenda in all this, and that agenda has nothing to do with
              contributing to the good government of Northern Ireland. It is
              about one thing and one thing only — bleeding Ulster dry, and if
              it can use the Government into which it has been put to achieve
              that, it will not hesitate to do so. All this condemns those who
              thought that it was a good idea to put these bloodsuckers into the
              Government of Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate raises the issue of the structure of
              government, and to some degree the report of the draft Budget for
              2001-02 deals with this. The structure of government means that
              the Minister’s hands, whether he likes it or not, are
              excessively tied. In many respects, this Government is a shambles.
              It is a shambles because there are too many Ministers, too many
              Departments and too much government, and for all the government
              that we have in this place there is very little legislation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP has shown that the structure of
              government lies at the heart of many of the Finance Minister’s
              problems. When the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
              introduced proposals to increase government to its present
              overwhelming size, we said that it was a political decision to
              give jobs to the boys. We said that it was excessive and wasteful,
              and today we have been proved right. There are people on the other
              side of the House who agreed in principle with this massive
              government who now see the folly of their ways. I see that my
              Colleague from North Antrim, Mr Leslie, is here. I noticed in a
              local newspaper that he called for a review of the size of the
              parties. I welcome that; it shows that some people realise that
              government here is too big and must be reduced. He also says that
              the only thing in favour of the DUP Ministers’ non-attendance is
              that a Committee of 10 is probably easier to work than a Committee
              of 12. However, a Committee of five or six is considerably easier
              to work than a Committee of 10. It shows that this Government is
              excessive and that the Minister’s hands are tied with regard to
              his Budget.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I found the Committee Chairpersons’ comments
              in the report of the draft Budget very interesting — so much for
              a united approach. The Chairpersons of various Committees — and
              not just DUP Chairpersons, but Ulster Unionist, SDLP and Sinn
              Féin Chairpersons — all criticised the Budget proposals. The
              exceptions were the SDLP Chairperson of the Health Committee, who
              did not bother reporting to us for various reasons; and the
              Chairperson of the Social Development Committee, Mr Cobain, who is
              too busy writing articles for the ‘Shankill Mirror’ to report
              his concerns on the matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every one of them talked of excessive shortfall
              and of their acute disappointment in the Budget, which Dr Birnie
              mentioned, its inadequacy and its lack of provision for victims.
              That shows that the Budget and the House are by no means united.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore we should have a cost-cutting
              exercise and we should endorse the DUP amendment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want very briefly to concentrate on the waste
              that lies at the heart of government because I think that this
              waste —</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will have to be brief as there is
              only one minute left.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall concentrate on a couple of points. Time
              and time again I have tried to plug the issue of waste by asking
              certain questions. I understand that the Minister of Agriculture
              is prepared to spend £2,400 on the steering committee on
              cross-border rural development, although all its work could be
              adequately performed by her Department.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Department of Agriculture and
              Rural Development’s pièce de résistance must be its recent
              decision to spend money on a peace maze at Castlewellan. A peace
              maze is well and good, and it might even attract tourists —
              there is, of course, no business programme for that — but this
              project cost £138,000, 25% of which came directly from the
              Department of Agriculture. Indeed, her Department contributed the
              other 75% or £103,500.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This waste, and that which is replicated across
              all Departments —</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Member bring his remarks to a close?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The waste across all the Departments must be
              plugged. I appeal to the Minister of Finance and Personnel to deal
              with the question of waste when drawing up his next Budget. Only
              then shall we see a real and meaningful budget.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Gildernew:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
              welcome the opportunity to debate the Budget and I acknowledge
              that it is a fairly substantial and generally good piece of work
              by the Executive. I congratulate the Executive and the Minister on
              their work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, as a member of the Social Development
              Committee I am extremely disappointed that the Department for
              Social Development failed to negotiate any substantive increase in
              its budgetary allocation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some departmental running costs are outrageous.
              Running the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, for
              example, accounts for 51·4% of the total expenditure, followed by
              the Department of the Environment. The Department for Social
              Development is not far behind. The Department’s central
              administration unit, the Child Support Agency and social security
              benefited most from additional cash.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, the community and voluntary
              sectors, which do sterling work in areas of great social need and
              which employ many people, have not received adequate funding. We
              must spend much more on these sectors to eradicate the differences
              between communities and to end discrimination rather than starve
              them of resources.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many community workers deal with long-term
              unemployment or drug and alcohol abuse while giving advice and
              practical assistance to the most disadvantaged and marginalised
              people in our communities. The sector employs thousands who work
              in communities for local people, yet many have already lost their
              jobs because of a lack of gap funding. As more people are employed
              in the community and voluntary sectors than in the textiles
              industry, we should try to stabilise employment in order to give
              job security to them in carrying out this valuable work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regeneration of our towns and villages has
              also been a victim of this Budget — the yearly allocation for
              this has been slashed by 4·4%. In recent years millions of pounds
              of public and private money have been pumped into east Belfast
              through the Laganside project. It follows therefore that increased
              expenditure in towns and villages would be a more appropriate
              means of levelling the playing field. No public finance has been
              channelled into regeneration, and the effects can clearly be seen
              in parts of our cities and towns. A great deal of work has been
              done, particularly in areas that have suffered deprivation and
              neglect for generations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I shall concentrate on the area that
              has suffered most in this Budget, and that is housing. I welcome
              the allocation of £3·5&nbsp;million for disabled adaptations and
              accept that this will greatly alleviate suffering and improve the
              quality of life for many disabled and elderly people, some of whom
              have been waiting for over two years. However, this is not enough.
              The Housing Executive’s budget is being increased by 1·5%,
              although when inflation has been taken into account, there is
              actually a decrease.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thousands of pounds are taken out of Housing
              Executive coffers every year in receipts from the sale of Housing
              Executive properties, leaving the Executive to pay interest for
              years on money that has long been returned to the British
              Exchequer.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This situation is not acceptable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, the Minister for Social
              Development proposes hiking Housing Executive rents by GDP plus
              2%, despite the Committee’s rejecting this ludicrous plan. If
              the Minister were really trying to avoid increasing rents, surely
              he would have made a bid for additional resources and gone to the
              Executive to argue his case. Although the Minister has told us how
              many kitchen and bathroom adaptations could be made if this
              increase were approved, we have not heard how this would affect
              those who are on benefits. What are the implications for those
              Housing Executive tenants who cannot get work or who are not fit
              to take it? I fear that these increases would ensure that every
              Housing Executive tenant would be on benefits, resulting in
              Housing Executive estates all over the Six Counties becoming a
              dumping ground for those who cannot get work or who are not fit to
              work. Mixed tenure housing would be a thing of the past, and the
              many people who cannot afford to go out to work could expect to
              see out their days in poverty.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why should young people who grow up on some of
              these estates strive to achieve anything at school if they are
              part of a culture that ensures they cannot afford to get a job
              when they leave? What shall we instil in future generations if
              they grow up believing that they will be dependent on benefits
              because the cost of living for those who work is too high? If the
              Minister insists on forcing these increases through, he will be
              making a mockery of targeting social need and will only highlight
              his lack of understanding of the needs of those who live in social
              housing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I add my name to the list of
              those who are opposed to an increase in the regional rate. The
              pain involved is not worth the gain, and many small businesses
              will go to the wall, particularly in rural communities. The
              difference between the pound and the punt means that businesses in
              my constituency are already struggling to make a living, but this
              increase will ensure that towns such as Aughnacloy, Dungannon,
              Kinawley and Belleek will have to shut up shop and accept defeat.
              No representative of rural and border constituencies can allow
              this rate to go through unopposed.</p>

              differential? It is easy to criticise; we can, however, seek
              alternatives. We should insist that moneys be made available from
              the peace dividend and we should think of more imaginative ways of
              resourcing our necessary services. Why should the Dublin
              Government not be asked to contribute to health, to roads and to
              an infrastructure that is already desperately poor in certain
              areas? We will not resort to bleeding the disadvantaged dry; we
              will not fleece those who pay for services to which they no longer
              have access; we will not ask people who must travel over 30 miles
              to the nearest accident and emergency or maternity unit to pay an
              additional 8% on their rates bill. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to focus on road safety, as urgent
              measures are needed to improve it, and to improve it quickly. I
              appeal to all those Ministers into whose portfolio it falls. We
              need a major injection of funding to tackle the terror that stalks
              our roads, particularly at Christmas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How many more mornings shall we wake to hear
              the tragic news of another death on our roads? These are young
              deaths, avoidable deaths. When shall we realise that more must be
              done?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having studied the Budget and the Department of
              the Environment’s plans, I commend the decision to increase the
              road safety budget over the next four years. It will increase from
              approximately £4 million to £10 million by 2004. That is
              valuable; but it is not enough. It is not enough.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also commend the Executive Committee’s
              decision to fund a recruitment drive to increase the number of
              road safety education officers. Come on! Road safety education
              officers are not enough. Just look at the death toll on our roads.
              We need much more. We must attack the cause of this scourge of
              modern society at its root and from every direction. We need a
              cross-departmental package. We must reduce speed limits, introduce
              more traffic-calming measures, especially in urban areas near
              primary schools and hospitals and in areas where children gather.
              The laws on speed limits and drink-driving must be applied more
              strictly. We must fund public transport. We have been speaking
              this afternoon about road improvements — and they are needed, in
              rural areas as well as in cities. However, to get people off the
              roads and into buses and trains increased funding of public
              transport is also needed, particularly for rail transport. That
              would reduce congestion and reduce the danger to pedestrians.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committees have highlighted the urgent need
              to reduce the overcrowding of children on buses. I do not have the
              exact figures to hand but I believe that 100 children may be
              transported on a 50-seater bus — without seat belts. We know
              what happens if we are stopped by the police and a child in the
              back of the car is not wearing a seat belt. However, we can cram
              our buses, which are not equipped with seat belts, full of
              schoolchildren and get away with it. What are we doing?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One vital issue that is probably not being
              tackled properly is the need for much more funding and more
              victims’ support groups to counsel the families of road death
              victims and the injured. Terrible trauma and tragedy are inflicted
              upon these families, and many have nowhere to go for the
              counselling that they need to bring them through the crisis.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are areas where a whole package of
              measures could be put into place immediately. I know that Members
              are aware that the issue is topical. However, it is not just
              topical: it is a matter of life and death and must be dealt with
              urgently.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to consider the breakdown of funding in
              the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.
              The Office has many responsibilities, but in the Budget allocation
              there is no mention of some of the important ones, such as the
              amount of money that will go to victims. That is number one.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, there are women’s issues. Do not
              forget that women’s centres are important for promoting lifelong
              learning, education and training. How much will go to them? Why
              has it not been broken down in the Budget?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Community relations is another. A famous
              gentleman, who was in the Province recently, said that peace is
              not a spectator sport. We have recognised that by urging more
              cross-community contact. Where is the money to support those grand
              words? Where is the money? I want to know.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One example that I always cite is integrated
              education, and I am glad that the Minister is present to hear
              this. How much more money do we need to promote the valuable
              cross-community work of integrated education? This morning there
              was a festival for integrated education in Irish-medium schools.
              That is valuable in bringing the matter to the fore, but I want
              money where mouths are. I want integrated education to be
              recognised as hugely important for the future of Northern Ireland,
              for peace building and for reconciliation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could mention many other topics such as
              industry and agriculture; I could mention marketing matters that
              must be dealt with. We must spend more on innovation, on energy
              efficiency, pollution control and waste. Where is the money to go
              into the things that Northern Ireland needs? However, I said that
              I would be brief and I shall finish there.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had intended to start by congratulating the
              Minister on making full use of the resources available to him.
              However, during the debate I have had something of a Damascus Road
              conversion. Listening to Mr John Kelly from Mid Ulster, I
              understood how lacking in innovation the Minister of Finance and
              Personnel had been. As well as looking for more money from the
              British Government, Mr Kelly said that we should speak to the
              Irish Government to find out how eager they are to fund
              reunification. If an approach were made to the Irish Government to
              put substantial funds into the Exchequer, perhaps we would see
              just how keen they really are beyond the rhetoric. We are also
              told of the great pool of money in Irish America.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us not leave the matter at that. We heard
              from Mr Kelly that we could perhaps trace Strongbow’s relatives
              to the root of Ireland’s historic problems and get them to
              finance the increases in the Budget. Let us not limit ourselves to
              the earth — the Executive could set aside a little bit of money
              for a satellite to go to far-flung galaxies that may be prepared
              to provide funding.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The relevance to the earthbound budget
              is increasingly distant. I ask the Member to stick to the earth,
              please.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an historic day; that, however, is not
              necessarily a compliment. After all, the Battle of Hastings was an
              historic day, but depending on whether one was on the side of King
              Harold or King William it was either a good historic day or a bad
              one. The Administration’s key test will be the people of
              Northern Ireland; and the test of the Budget will be the system of
              government’s ability to change things for their good.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to return briefly to Mr Close’s
              remarks. He quite properly raised the question of the regional
              rate and its inequities, but his party’s position beggars
              belief. Mr Close told us to avoid being Pontius Pilate, but the
              Alliance position on the two amendments is precisely that. The
              position of Mr McGrady and others in supporting the increase in
              the regional rate is an honourable one. They said that we should
              either justify the increase or back one of the amendments or move
              an amendment of our own. However, to say &quot;We do not like the
              regional rate, but we will not table an amendment to the Budget
              proposals&quot; is the epitome of Pontius Pilate.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should say, to give some comfort to the
              Alliance Party, that I watched a programme during the week in
              which the potential new Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, who is
              racing ahead in the polls, is a member of a centrist group called
              New Alliance. I should point out, in case the Alliance Party gets
              too excited, that it was a work of fiction. Similarly, the
              Alliance proposals have been completely fictional, because they do
              not materialise at any stage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the whole, I welcome the Budget. Mark Durkan
              has done a fairly good job. In particular, I welcome the spending
              on health, education, and railways — which have been neglected
              by our society — and on transport for the elderly. I also
              welcome moneys going, albeit belatedly, towards student fees.
              However, having a good Budget that has been broadly welcomed does
              not mean that the Budget is perfect.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That brings me to the amendments. Although
              neither is perfect, both are an improvement, and consequently I
              shall be supporting them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much has been made of the regional rate, and it
              is a particularly iniquitous tax. The increase in the regional
              rate will hit many who can least afford it. It is not a
              progressive tax. Some of us belong to a party that does not
              believe in regional tax-varying powers. Indeed, one of the few
              good things in the agreement is the absence of tax-varying powers.
              Having ensured that tax-varying powers are not contained in the
              agreement, we should not let them in by the back door. If we are
              to have tax-varying powers such as the regional rate let us at
              least be honest about it. Let us not produce something that merely
              passes the buck — and the blame — to local government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can speak as one, to use Mr Close’s
              expression, &quot;with clean hands&quot;. I have no connection
              with local government, and I am not a councillor trying to remove
              the burden from it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What arguments were used in favour of this
              increase in rates? Mr McGrady told us that the £11 million or
              £12 million — that is what it will amount to — is needed for
              education and health. They are the sectors, it is claimed, that
              will be hit by refusing this increase in the regional rate.
              However, the regional rate is not directly targeted at any
              particular aspect of Government. Therefore it is nonsense to
              suggest that refusing the increase in the regional rate will
              affect education and health.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are also told that reducing the regional
              rate increase to the level of inflation will somehow offend the
              Treasury so much that any argument on the Barnett formula will be
              rendered completely null and void. I could accept the merit in
              that argument if we were proposing a reduction in the regional
              rate or even suggesting that the regional rate remain at its
              present level. However, these amendments propose that the regional
              rate increase purely at the rate of inflation. By saving £11
              million or £12 million, the Assembly does not damage its argument
              that we do not get an equitable deal from the Barnett formula. We
              must push for it. This is a matter in which the Assembly can be
              innovative and not simply copy direct rule.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said that there were some flaws in the
              amendments. My only concern with the DUP amendment is whether we
              could raise all £12 million through the changes that it suggests.
              In favour of its amendment, I agree that there is a layer of fat
              in &quot;North/Southery&quot;, particularly in the Civic Forum,
              which serves no useful purpose. Savings could be made there.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I turn to the Sinn Féin amendment. That party
              signed up to the Budget in the Executive and it can justifiably be
              accused of hypocrisy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Its proposals are vague and are directed purely
              at the Executive programme funds. Nevertheless, if we are to take
              an innovative step to keep the regional rate down, changes must be
              made. However, where will the money come from?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some suggested scaling down the British
              military budget. It is interesting that those who suggest this
              could reduce that budget by delivering decommissioning. Leaving
              that aside, were either of these amendments agreed, we would be
              unlikely to see either the North/South bodies or the Executive
              Budget completely destroyed, as Members of the Executive regard
              them as the sacred cows of this process. Were either of these
              amendments agreed, the money would mysteriously be found. In the
              various monitoring rounds we have seen savings of £40 million,
              £50 million, even £60 million being pulled out of the hat.
              Making either of these amendments will reduce some of the fat in
              the system.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, departmental running costs are
              projected to rise by 10%. If the increase in departmental running
              costs was pegged back to the rate of increase across the spend —
              7·8% — we would generate more than enough money to keep the
              regional rate in line with inflation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Money can be saved there, and the increase in
              the regional rate is iniquitous. We should take this opportunity
              to send the message that we are breaking with the past. We must
              stop the regional rate increase and reduce it to the rate of
              inflation.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members may be puzzled about why I have
              introduced several Members who are Committee Chairpersons or
              Deputy Chairpersons without giving that information. That is
              because I only call Members as Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson
              when they have said that they wish to speak in that capacity.
              Sometimes I do not have the information to hand; sometimes the
              Member chooses, although holding an office, not to speak in that
              capacity. I am aware that this has created a degree of
              uncertainty.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Education Committee (Mr
              Kennedy):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for the opportunity to comment on
              the Budget for 2001-02 and on the public spending plans for the
              following two years. The Education Committee considered the draft
              budget for the Department of Education in detail and passed its
              comments on to the Minister. The Committee notes that, with regard
              to education, this Budget allows for little more than maintenance
              of current spending with uplift for inflation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The education of our children and young people
              is important for a vibrant and growing economy. It is important
              that the Assembly, the Executive and the Minister of Finance and
              Personnel recognise that funding education is an investment in the
              future of Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s making an additional
              £1·3 million available for repairs to school buildings in his
              revised Budget. The Education Committee has heard at first hand of
              the appalling conditions in many of our schools and of the poor
              accommodation that pupils and teachers cope with every day. Those
              problems include lack of space, leaking roofs, unsafe windows and
              buildings, crumbling concrete and appalling personal conditions.
              These are all health risks. The Committee pressed for more money
              to tackle these problems.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We believe that every child deserves safe,
              appropriate and excellent educational facilities in which to
              learn. Although the extra money will be put to good use, it is not
              enough to improve the appalling conditions of the school estate. I
              hope that the Minister will take account of the representations
              made by the Education Committee and will include them in his
              spending plans for the next couple of years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the consolidation of the March 2000
              Budget addition of £15·2 million for schools. The Education
              Committee is holding detailed discussions with departmental
              officials about how the money available for schools should be
              allocated. However, the application of the Barnett formula has had
              a real effect on the allocation of money to schools and raises
              issues of equity. Applying that to the Chancellor’s announcement
              last July, the Department of Education received only 3·3 %,
              rather than the increase needed to match the amount given to
              schools in England. That was a shortfall of millions of pounds. As
              a result, schools in Northern Ireland rightly believe that they
              are being treated less favourably than schools in England. The
              Education Committee has major concerns about Northern Ireland not
              getting its fair share under this formula. We seek a commitment
              from the Minister that he and his Executive Colleagues will
              continue to press the issue hard with the Treasury to achieve a
              more equitable approach to the allocation of funding for
              education.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also note that the allocation of the
              Executive programme funds will be considered early in the new
              year. Again, the Education Committee outlined detailed bids in its
              response to the draft Budget, and I would like an assurance from
              the Minister that account will be taken of those bids at the
              appropriate time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister — indeed all Members — will
              recall the debate of 28 November. Members endorsed the motion
              calling for the payment of a retainer fee for term-time only
              workers and actually commended the Education Committee’s
              proposal to provide money from the education budget to pay the
              salary costs incurred. I understand that the management of the
              education and library boards has put comprehensive draft proposals
              to the trades unions that represent term-time staff to resolve
              this long-standing issue. Those proposals will be subject to
              available moneys being found. Given that the Assembly endorsed the
              Education Committee’s call to provide additional funds, will the
              Minister give a commitment that the necessary additional funds
              will be made available in the education budget to ensure an early
              and equitable settlement to this long-running affair?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Education Committee has held in-depth
              discussions with the Department on the draft Budget. We shall
              discuss with the Department how to make the best use of scarce
              resources to achieve value for money.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In doing so, the Committee will ensure sure
              that pupils, schoolteachers and principals see the real benefit of
              the available funding.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the Minister’s statement of 12
              December 2000 that in future the draft Budget will be presented
              earlier so that the scrutiny Committees can execute their
              statutory duties properly. I would like the Minister to deal with
              the points concerning term-time staff and the education budget as
              a whole.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have heard little today in the two amendments
              proposed by the DUP and Sinn Féin that leads me to believe that
              either could produce a worthwhile outcome. The Sinn Féin
              amendment refers, among other things, to how the rates burden is
              spread and its adverse effect on small businesses.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a representative of a border constituency, I
              am aware that there is some unfairness in how rates are levied.
              The economy of border constituencies has suffered from currency
              differences, as everybody knows; yet, property owners in border
              areas must pay the same rates as property owners in areas where
              currency differences have little or no effect. According to the
              Sinn Féin amendment, rates could be reduced across the board.
              However, businesses in areas of economic decline would still pay
              the same rates as businesses in prosperous areas. The amendment
              makes no distinction between businesses that are doing well and
              businesses that are trading in very difficult circumstances. I am
              at a loss to see the fairness of this amendment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are to have fairness — and it is
              important that we do — we must consider levying rates to take
              account of the economic climate in which trade and business
              operate. There are very wide variations in the economic climate of
              border towns and towns such as Bangor, Belfast or Ballymena. Will
              the rates review be effective in considering those issues, and
              will the Minister set out a timetable for completing the task?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members referred to the rates burdens in rural
              areas. Shops and businesses in rural areas find rates a very heavy
              burden. In England, under a rural rates relief scheme, some
              businesses now benefit from rates rebates of up to 50%.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call on the Minister to do the necessary
              preparatory work immediately to introduce a rates relief scheme
              for trade and businesses in rural areas of Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP amendment proposed that the North/South
              bodies be wound down to make savings. Waterways Ireland is located
              in Enniskillen and plans are now well advanced to build a new
              headquarters there and so create 70 new jobs for an area that
              sorely needs them. Several factories have closed in Fermanagh, and
              any attempt to restrict a job-creating initiative like this would
              be a disaster.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The potential impact of the all-Ireland tourism
              body cannot be overemphasised, especially in areas where tourism
              makes a significant contribution. Fermanagh is such an area. In
              1999 tourism generated £20 million for the local economy. People
              in my constituency are looking forward to the increased benefits
              of an international marketing body working for the whole of
              Ireland. Under this arrangement all areas with tourism potential,
              from Belleek to Belfast, will have more resources at their
              disposal. The money that will be spent on marketing tourism in all
              parts of Ireland will be well above what Northern Ireland could
              afford on its own. I am certain that those who run hotels, bars,
              restaurants, caravan parks and cruiser-hire businesses will see no
              merit at all in the DUP’s amendment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the increased allocations across
              Government Departments, especially in the two areas in which I
              have a particular interest as a Committee member: health and
              education. The allocation for health is some way short of the
              Department’s initial bid; a shortfall that was further
              emphasised last week in a report that dealt with per capita
              spending in England, Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland we
              spend £875 per head compared with £927 in Wales and £1,056 in
              Scotland. There is a clear need for greater investment in the
              Health Service, and that has been evident from recent crises in
              bed shortages and in the treatment of fractures.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More detail is needed on how the Department’s
              resources are allocated. Mr McFarland referred to this problem,
              and it also came up last week during the debate on children’s
              services. How do allocated funds end up being used for unintended
              purposes as they make their way from the Department through the
              various authorities?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to comment on the withdrawal without
              warning of key services from some of our hospitals — the latest
              being the Erne hospital in Enniskillen. From now on it is
              essential that there be complete openness and transparency about
              the use of money as it filters down from the Department through
              the various health authorities. I ask the Minister whether the
              Department of Finance and Personnel will provide an audit trail in
              future so that the Assembly can follow what happens more closely.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall finish with a reference to the
              Executive programme funds. As Members know, these funds cover
              strategies to eradicate poverty and to support children in need
              and young people at risk and other initiatives to improve health
              and education in particular. Considerable funding will be directed
              towards those Departments with Sinn Féin Ministers. I am
              therefore astonished at the Sinn Féin amendment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Gildernew raised the important issue of
              support for the community and voluntary sectors, but in the Budget
              the greatest scope for improvement in that area comes from the
              Executive programme funds. If Ms Gildernew wishes to demonstrate
              genuine support — and I know that her feelings on the subject
              are genuine — it is difficult to see how she can support her
              party’s amendment.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee of the Centre
              (Mr Poots):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened intently to the last Member. I am
              sure that Mr Lenin and Mr Stalin would have been proud of him: he
              creates more jobs by creating more bureaucracy. He thinks that
              making more jobs for civil servants is real job creation. However,
              it has been pointed out for years that Northern Ireland relies too
              heavily on the public service sector and that more opportunities
              should be created in manufacturing — real jobs showing real
              returns.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not wish to go over matters already dealt
              with by the mover of the amendment, Mr Dodds, other than to say
              that he outlined clearly and concisely how savings could be made
              so that we could avoid raising the rates by 8%.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened to the bluster of my Colleague from
              Lagan Valley, Mr Close, but I come from Lagan Valley and am well
              used to it — all sound and no substance. He did not move an
              amendment; but he could not support an amendment. If we were to
              follow Mr Close’s line we would have no money in our Budget. We
              would have no hospital beds and we would not be able to fix a
              pothole because we would not want to use the money in the Budget.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close’s policies would give us taxation
              without spending. I am well used to his policy of raising rates
              well above the rate of inflation. In Lisburn Borough Council he
              was always very keen to do that. I find that interesting.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was amusing to hear Sinn Féin speak of a
              peace dividend. There has indeed been a lack of investment in
              hospitals, in the capital development of schools, in basic
              infrastructure and in roads and sewerage systems, but that is
              because each year the Government have had to siphon off so much
              money for the security budget and for compensation. Why? Primarily
              because of IRA terrorism and the damage it caused the economy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our schools, hospitals, roads and sewerage
              systems lag behind those in the rest of the United Kingdom because
              of the devastating effect that the IRA/Sinn Féin bombing campaign
              had on the Province. It is they who have taken money from the
              Province. It is they have taken it out of the hands of the people
              of Northern Ireland; money that has had to be used for rebuilding
              and redeveloping shops in Belfast city centre — shops that were
              blown up by that organisation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to raise some matters on the subject of
              agriculture before I speak about the Committee of the Centre.
              There is little in the proposals to develop agriculture’s
              infrastructure and there is little to benefit farmers. There is
              more about building Departments than about building the
              agricultural economy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was an extra £1 million in the
              Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure’s budget for capital
              expenditure on libraries. I hope that the Minister will give
              serious consideration to the matter of library provision in
              Lisburn, as it has been outstanding for 25 years. I hope that he
              will stop pussyfooting around with private finance initiatives
              that he knows will not materialise and that he will put in place
              plans to give Lisburn the library that it deserves.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister must find ways of dealing with
              waste in the 10 Departments and with the quangos that were
              supposed to cease when the 10 Departments were established. I do
              not know of one quango that has ceased since devolution.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee of the Centre has studied the
              number of people employed in senior ranks in the Office of the
              First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. There is the head of
              the Northern Ireland Civil Service and seven under-secretaries.
              The cost of those under-secretaries — salaries, pensions and
              National Insurance contributions — is £95,000 each a year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are also 14 under-secretaries costing
              £70,000 each a year. A further two under-secretaries at £70,000
              each a year facilitate the two junior Ministers whom we do not
              need. No one seems to know what they do — they disappeared into
              Castle Buildings, and nobody ever hears of them. There are also a
              further 40 staff at grade 7 level, costing £50,000 each. That
              comes to roughly £4 million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of the Department’s £26 million spending,
              £4 million goes to senior staff; it is top-heavy and overloaded.
              The First Minister and the Deputy First Minister must deal with
              this. How can we take them seriously with such a staffing
              structure? They have yet to set out a corporate or business plan
              for their Department. That Department could not make a case for
              money for victims. The victims sought £500,000, which is not a
              great deal of money; they failed to get anything. In October they
              received £200,000 — a drop in the ocean.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this era, electronic communications are the
              way ahead. &quot;If you are not in, you cannot win&quot;; and we
              must keep abreast of developments. Despite requests for £14·9
              million to develop e-government and a second request for
              £900,000, nothing was received. The delay will cause Northern
              Ireland to lose out on savings that could be made through proper
              e-government. It will allow the digital divide to open and will
              result in different levels of access to government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Shall we get the benefit of joined-up
              e-government? Shall we continue with disjointed expenditure and
              repeat examples of incompatible computer systems in different
              parts of government? Some parts of government operate Lotus, while
              others operate Microsoft. The two sections of staff cannot
              communicate with each other on the electronic system because their
              systems are incompatible. Why has that not been rectified? Why are
              we not making savings in that area?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about the Executive programme
              funds. The Executive will have built up to £220 million by
              2003-04. It worries me that the Executive are taking over so many
              areas. The Executive programme funds will have more money than the
              Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Department of
              Culture, Arts and Leisure, the Department of the Environment, the
              Department of Finance and Personnel and the Office of the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister. One wonders what agenda is
              behind this attempt to claw so much money into the Executive
              programme funds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the amendment of my Colleague Mr
              Dodds. He has identified waste in the Government. He has
              identified unnecessary spending, and the House would do well not
              to place the burden of that waste and unnecessary spending on
              businesses and on the ordinary man and woman in the street who
              will have to pay the extra tax.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unfair to call it the Durkan Tax: it is
              the Mowlam/ Durkan Tax. Mowlam proposed it and Durkan is imposing
              it. It is not a good tax, and I urge the House to support the
              amendment.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reviewed the remarks that I made at the
              conclusion of the take-note debate on the Budget. It would be
              straightforward to read them again and save myself the trouble of
              having to make another speech, because the same points have been
              raised. Will the Minister of Finance and Personnel restrain
              himself from spending so long repeating those points? There may be
              some new ones for him to cover.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister knows that I have consistently
              questioned the level of the rates and he also knows that I have
              consistently questioned him in the Finance and Personnel Committee
              on the total cost of government. There will inevitably be a
              j-curve — things will get worse before they get better. However,
              we must plan for the &quot;getting better&quot; in two or three
              years’ time. I therefore urge the Executive to put that nearer
              to the top of their agenda as they plan for the future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Government expenditure must be scrutinised
              by the Assembly to ensure value for money and to ensure that the
              public gets a good deal for the money that is being spent. That is
              particularly true for one lot of money that is directly
              contributed by people in Northern Ireland — the rates.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist Party has lobbied the
              Minister intensively on the housing budget and on housing
              improvements. We must be mindful that some of these measures
              appear to disadvantage people on low or no incomes. A stratum of
              people is not feeling the benefits of economic growth and falling
              unemployment, and it is incumbent on us to deal with their needs
              very specifically. In the July and October monitoring rounds it
              was clear that much of the extra money was generated by the sale
              of Housing Executive properties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind the Minister that we are, in a sense,
              living off capital. We have disposed of a capital asset and we
              still have a debt on it that we must settle eventually. Meanwhile,
              our income to service that debt is being reduced by the depletion
              of the capital. By improving Housing Executive properties, we are
              reinvesting in that asset and improving its quality. That in turn
              should make it easier to achieve more sales.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The argument has been made that
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland pays less in rates than the rest of the
              United&nbsp;Kingdom. It should be borne in mind that the rest of
              the United Kingdom pays regional rates and water rates. So far, we
              have been spared domestic water rates, although businesses pay
              them. If this argument is to hold water, I look forward to the
              Minister’s undertaking an intensive exercise with Colleagues in
              Wales and in Scotland to formulate a review of the Barnett formula
              to present to the Treasury.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn&nbsp;Féin’s amendment at least spreads
              the burden of finding the money evenly by targeting the Executive
              programme funds. However, the Sinn&nbsp;Féin Members who spoke
              seemed to take a different line. They did not want any reduction
              in money, but somebody else would have to come up with it —
              everybody but the people of Northern Ireland. We must stop looking
              to others to provide us with money. We should be looking forward
              to paying our own bills and to standing on our own two feet.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was intrigued by some of Mr&nbsp;Molloy’s
              remarks; perhaps they give us an insight into an item in the next
              Sinn&nbsp;Féin election manifesto — the one for elections to
              the Dáil. I understand that his Colleague Mr Adams, among others,
              proposes to stand for them. When Mr&nbsp;Adams is targeting a seat
              in Donegal, will his manifesto include a commitment to ask the
              people of the Republic of Ireland to cough up another 4% of their
              rates? Will he ask them to give the money to the people of
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland to avoid an 8% increase in rates here?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It also seems curious that although Sinn&nbsp;Féin’s
              two Ministers were involved in devising and agreeing the Budget,
              their party has moved an amendment that fundamentally disagrees
              with some of its contents. It is completely inconsistent. They
              must take responsibility for popular and unpopular elements.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP’s amendment was much more targeted at
              where the money would be deducted. It came as no surprise to these
              Benches that it looked towards the North/South bodies. We should
              remind ourselves about the selection of ministerial posts. DUP
              Members claim to be the most devout and evangelical defenders of
              the Union (despite agreeing with Sinn Féin that the North/ South
              bodies are a stepping stone to a united Ireland). However, when
              the d’Hondt formula was run, the DUP specifically avoided taking
              a position on these bodies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It targeted instead two Departments with no
              cross-border bodies. How would DUP Members defend their Union by
              avoiding those Departments? It is curious that the DUP goes on and
              on about the problems in the agriculture industry and about what
              should be done about them; yet presented with two opportunities to
              take the Department of Agriculture, which contains a cross-border
              body, it seized neither.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As with the rates, and as with all Government
              expenditure, we must get value for money from the North/South
              bodies, and the tourism body stands out in that respect. If the
              tourism body works well, the £5·8 million will be well spent on
              behalf of Northern Ireland, but we must scrutinise this constantly
              and review how the money is spent to satisfy ourselves that we get
              good value for it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We hear throughout these debates about deprived
              areas, which always seem to be along the border and always seem to
              be west of the Bann. Moyle district in my constituency has, sadly,
              the worst rate of unemployment in Northern Ireland. It is a
              deprived area not adjacent to the border with the Republic of
              Ireland; it is, however, adjacent to the border with Scotland. Is
              that sufficient to get it within the purview of the money that
              must always be spent on deprived border areas?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reverting to the need for a review of the
              Barnett formula, I note that a recent audit identified social
              security fraud of more than £50 million. In Northern Ireland
              social security is administered by the Department for Social
              Development. Would it not be a good thing to root out social
              security fraud in order to reduce the money that we spend not just
              under this Budget but under any budget? That would strengthen our
              hand in negotiations with the Treasury for a review of the
              formula.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I must point out again that I am no
              fan of any form of taxation and no fan of the rates, but the
              figure that Mr Peter Robinson quoted of £12 million is the
              difference between 2·9% and 8·8%. If that is a correct figure,
              and there are roughly one million adults in Northern Ireland, it
              would be £1 a month on the present rates for every adult. It is
              not a king’s ransom, provided that we get good value from the
              money. I urge Members to reject the amendments and to support the
              Budget.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I rise to support the DUP amendment and also to
              highlight a couple of matters in the Budget. Leir an lairnin bes

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Education is one area in which the Ulster-Scots
              community, and in particular the Ulster-Scots language movement,
              calls for significant improvement. Historically, the Ulster-Scots
              language has suffered from much greater discrimination and
              marginalisation than Irish, and that is no longer acceptable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure’s
              budget shows that funding for the North/South languages body will
              be increased in its first year; in the second year it will be
              increased by £1·2 million. Is this money being well spent? I
              suggest that it is not. Some of it will be spent on the Irish
              language TV channel. We are well aware of the numbers who watch
              it. It has some of the worst viewing figures in the whole of
              Ireland, in the whole of the United Kingdom and possibly in the
              whole of Europe.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A TV station in Antarctica might get fewer
              viewers, I suppose, but the Irish language channel wins the prize
              for having the fewest viewers in Ireland and the United Kingdom.
              If it were not for westerns and Premier League football, nobody
              would watch it.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has not been parity for Ulster-Scots in
              education or in promoting the language in other ways. In the past
              few years, Irish language, culture and tradition has received £11
              million, whereas Ulster-Scots has received £1·2 million. That
              highlights the lack of equality. Such parity is not apparent in
              the Budget, and the more we look at it, the more serious the
              problem appears. What criterion is used to justify promoting the
              Irish language above Ulster-Scots? Where is the fair play in the
              system? There is very little of it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not need the North/South bodies; we
              should take away the budget of £3·5 million, proposed for
              2001-02, and put it into something better. Members from our party
              have said that there is a great deal of waste in some of the
              Departments; we should look at that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a marginal increase for fisheries, an
              increase so small that it could easily be missed. We realise the
              position that the fishing industry is in. The code of restrictions
              has hit the industry hard. Is there money in the Budget to address
              the problems of the fishing industry? I am thinking particularly
              of the villages of Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie — my own
              village — on the Ards Peninsula? Where is the help for the
              fishing industry? It cannot be provided from within the fisheries
              budget. That money is for improving harbour facilities in two or
              three areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is talk of improving children’s
              services. There are many deficiencies in that part of the Budget.
              For example, there is not enough money for children with special
              needs and with disabilities. Where will the money come from? We
              understand that an extra £7 million is available, and we would
              like to see whether it will go towards those who are in most need.
              That is how it should have been. It is good to know that free
              travel for elderly people — a DUP initiative — is in the
              Budget, but it is disappointing that it will be 2002 before it
              happens.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We could save money by taking it away from the
              North/South bodies or the Civic Forum. All that money is being
              used for no purpose other than to promote a political viewpoint.
              We in the DUP want to see the money being well spent — on
              health, education, roads and those with special needs. That would
              be the wise way of spending the money, and I urge Members to
              support the DUP amendment.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. At the start of the
              debate, the Minister said that he was looking forward to what he
              hoped would be a constructive debate on the amendments. For the
              most part, that has been the case but, as usual, some Members
              could not contain themselves.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of today’s debate was to consider
              the draft Budget; it represents the Executive’s best guess. As
              the Minister said, there has not been enough time to consider the
              Budget fully, and I pay tribute again to the Ministers who are
              working hard, grappling with competing demands and doing their
              best for all the Departments. However, the purpose of today’s
              debate was to scrutinise the Budget and make any necessary
              amendments. That is why the draft Budget was published — for
              consultation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If, as some Members suggested, we are to be
              beholden to what the Executive have agreed, Members might as well
              go home and forget about having a say in the matter. My party has
              clearly demonstrated that it is prepared to work hard in the
              Executive and the other institutions and will continue to do so.
              However, where we have a difference of opinion with the rest of
              the Executive, we will put it on the record and, as a party with
              its own mandate, we will pursue our aims in the best way that we
              can.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This morning I tried to put our amendment into
              a positive and constructive context, and I will continue to do
              that. I commended our amendment to the Assembly on the basis that
              there has been criticism and anxiety about the proposed rates
              increase, particularly in the small retail sector. The increase
              would impose an unfair burden on those least able to pay it, while
              whole swathes of the manufacturing industry would not have to pay
              a thing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP’s amendment — at least they had the
              courage to table one, unlike other people in the Chamber — is a
              party political stunt. Peter Robinson said — this is where he
              contradicted himself, so he might want to listen to what I say —
              that Sinn Féin’s amendment would take money from the Executive
              programme funds, which were all but allocated except for the
              minutiae, and that it would take money away from children’s
              programmes. He then said that the Executive programme funds only
              existed so that Trimble and Mallon could deliver good news
              stories. It cannot be both; it has to be one or the other. My
              party supports the notion of Executive programme funds and will
              continue to do so, because they represent an important way of
              making strategic interventions for infrastructure or other
              programmes that Members might support from time to time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher said that he could not understand
              why we were asking for a reduction in the rate increase. He
              suggested that we look at preparatory work on rates relief. I
              would support that, but if we did it without thinking it through
              or costing it, we would reduce the revenue that we would raise by
              the proposed increase.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin’s amendment is simple. To increase
              the rates by more than the rate of inflation will not realise the
              funds that the Executive need and will be an unfair burden on
              those who have to pay it. Our amendment would create a
              breathing-space, during which we could use some of the money from
              the Executive programme funds for a specific purpose. It would be
              a one-off and would give us the time to do what Mr Gallagher and
              others are suggesting. I make no apology for saying that the
              British Government — or indeed the Irish Government — have a
              responsibility to pay extra money into this part of Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was especially annoyed and offended by Mr
              McGrady’s comments about the begging bowl. Perhaps Mr McGrady’s
              life is comfortable and things are OK for him. However, other
              people in his constituency do not consider it as begging to go to
              the Exchequer or the Irish Government for extra funding for
              services that we have been denied for many years because of
              discriminatory and neglectful policies. It was regrettable that Mr
              McGrady introduced that tone to the debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin will be constructive about the
              matter. This morning I paid tribute to the Ministers in the
              Executive who attend and work together. Where there is a
              difference of opinion, Sinn Féin will be consistent and will put
              that opinion to the Executive. If we feel that it is necessary, we
              will advance those arguments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that there have been regular
              differences of opinion in the Executive. Why would there not be?
              There are at least three parties working together on the Executive
              who have different mandates and different manifesto positions.
              Therefore, it is appropriate and reasonable that there should
              occasionally be differences of opinion. If those people are
              committed to working with each other, rather than against each
              other, the good work that has been achieved by the Executive and
              all the other institutions will continue to be built upon.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that Members argue about each
              other’s point of view, but it is silly to make crystal ball
              analyses of where one party or another might be. Mr Leslie should
              be more concerned about where his own party will be. His task in
              the months ahead is to establish his party as a credible force in
              the Executive. We support the Budget. We are trying to amend it,
              but we support the Budget as a whole, difficulties included. We
              also support the Programme for Government, which the Unionist
              Party is undermining by its activities. The Unionist Party would
              do well to analyse the Barnett formula. It is easy to dismiss the
              arguments and say that we should pay for ourselves: we have
              neither economic nor political sovereignty. Until we do — or are
              allowed to — we cannot expect to do all the things that we want
              to do.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a mandate and we have a manifesto that
              we will do our best to pursue. However, that manifesto commits us
              to work with the parties in the institutions. We will never be
              found wanting on that. The other parties should accept their
              responsibilities, rather than making cheap remarks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sit on the Committee with Mr Close. We have
              heard so much hot air and so much bubble from him about the rates,
              but he did not even table an amendment this morning. Perhaps we
              should not worry ourselves about that. Mr Close talks about a
              manifesto position, but the rate of increase in support for his
              party suggests that he will not have to worry about manifestos. We
              will leave that to the electorate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend our amendment on the basis that it
              represents an opportunity to draw breath before we impose an
              unfair rates increase. It is very rare for rates to come down once
              they have gone up. Furthermore, there are commitments throughout
              the Programme for Government concerning reviews and
              re-examinations of the entire structure of Government and the
              various programmes. That gives us plenty of scope to increase the
              money available, even within the current grant. The amendment
              would allow us to draw breath and take stock before we impose an
              unfair burden on those who are least able to carry it.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall respond to some of the points that were
              made about our amendment. Mr Close suffered a fair amount of
              criticism in the debate — rightly so, in the opinion of
              virtually everyone in the House. I felt rather sorry for him,
              because all the bluster, passion and energy that he worked up
              could not disguise the fact that he slept in when it mattered
              most. He did not bother to put down an amendment. He waxed so
              lyrical on the issue, but it was all just empty rhetoric.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party recently produced an
              alternative Budget. As an alternative Government — I can see
              four of them sitting there — they had the wonderful idea of
              presenting a Budget. Today they have not produced a single
              alternative to the Minister’s Budget.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close stretches credulity when he suggests
              that simply voting against the Budget is sufficient compensation
              for failing totally to have put down any realistic alternative to
              it. Then he tells his party Colleagues and us that he looks
              forward to other parties joining him in lobbying against the
              increase in the regional rate. Next he will tell us that he is
              glad that the 190,000 or so people who voted for Dr Paisley are
              going to join the 14,000 people who voted for him in the European
              elections to fight in Europe for the farmers of Northern Ireland.
              The absolute audacity of the 2% party to my right lecturing others
              about joining them in lobbying really does beggar belief when it
              has not even had the sense or wit — or perhaps even the ability
              — to table an amendment to the Budget. Despite its pretence and
              spurious attempts during the debates on statements in the House to
              claim this issue as its own, it is the Democratic Unionist Party
              that raised the issue before the Alliance Party.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do not get excited, there is more to come. Now
              I can see why you do not want anything to do with your former
              Colleagues, Mr Speaker, and why you were earlier at pains to
              distance yourself from any association with them. In the last
              major debate on the Budget, we had Mr Close admitting that all the
              quotations and points that he was going to make had already been
              made by those of us on this side of the House. So let us have a
              little bit of reality and common sense.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This morning Mr Close then told us that people
              were hand-wringing and scrambling to distance themselves from the
              decisions of the Executive. Clearly, there has been some running
              for cover on the parts of those who attended the Executive and who
              signed up to those decisions from which they now want to run away.
              We will let the two Sinn Féin Ministers hang out there to dry. We
              are not responsible for what they are doing. We will put a knife
              in their back — Sinn Féin can do what it likes in the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as this party is concerned, we did not
              attend the Executive; we never gave our assent to this Budget; we
              never agreed to any increase in the regional rate. We have been
              totally consistent. However, Mr Close tells us that we are Members
              of the Executive and therefore, responsible. So, since he is a
              Member of this Assembly, if the Assembly votes this Budget through
              tonight, is he responsible?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will be voting against it.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He will be voting against it, just as we will
              be voting against it, just as we did not assent to the Budget in
              the first place. So at last the logic of the position dawns on Mr
              Close. I am so sorry that it has taken until 8.15 at night for
              that reality finally to dawn. But then, since he did miss the 9.30
              deadline for tabling amendments this morning, we will allow him
              that bit of latitude.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin, in particular, agreed to this
              regional rate increase in the Executive and never raised any
              objection to it until today. Indeed, a previous contributor —
              the Member of Sinn Féin who was on the Finance and Personnel
              Committee when this issue was raised — described those of us who
              criticised the increase in the regional rate beyond the rate of
              inflation as having adopted a shallow approach. This was a shallow
              approach. He did not want to have any debate; he did not want to
              have any vote. He did not want the Committee to come out against
              the regional rate. Now he comes to the House and beats his chest
              because somehow his party is now against the regional rate, having
              supported it in the Executive, having omitted to speak out against
              it until now, and having refused to speak against it in the
              Committee — when he attended the Committee. I never see that
              particular Member there. He certainly did not fight. Calm down. Do
              not get excited.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This proves that what we have said all along
              about the nature of this system of government is true. There is no
              collective responsibility whatsoever. Every Minister does his or
              her own thing in his or her own Department. The Minister of
              Finance can come here and make proposals which can even be agreed
              in the Executive, but when it comes to the House, every party is
              free. Nobody is bound, and even Ministers can vote against what
              they agreed in the Executive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will wait and see if the two Ministers who
              supported this proposal in the Executive, but then had a rebellion
              on their hands in their Assembly party, will go into the Lobbies
              to vote against what was agreed in the Executive by the UUP, the
              SDLP and Sinn Féin. All these parties agreed in the Executive
              that the regional rate should increase by 8%. The people of
              Northern Ireland have already seen that rate increase by over 8%
              in the last two years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie, in commenting on the DUP amendment,
              described the amount of money as being insignificant in the
              context of the overall Budget — that argument has been trotted
              out on a number of occasions. The people of Northern Ireland will
              regard as significant another 8% increase in the regional rate.
              They will regard as significant the expenditure of some £20
              million, taking into account the all-Ireland tourism company,
              which was last year taken as part of the all-Ireland bodies. I
              have already outlined what that money could do to reduce the
              regional rate and, if the Executive were so minded, how that
              expenditure could alleviate a whole range of social needs. We are
              not dealing with trivial amounts of expenditure; this is real
              money. This issue affects people’s pockets and it deserves to be
              taken seriously.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were also told that those who had been
              working within the Departments would simply be working under new
              bosses in the North/South implementation bodies. If that is the
              case, it is up to the Minister to decide where that necessary work
              should continue within the local Departments. In our amendment we
              have said that he should take sufficient amounts from the budgets
              of the North/South implementation bodies and the Secretariat of
              the North/South Ministerial Council and, if necessary, from the
              Civic Forum to pay for the reduction in the rate. That should
              leave him enough to get on with the necessary, day-to-day work
              within the Departments that employ those people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady and others on the Nationalist side
              have berated us because they say we are acting against the Belfast
              Agreement. They are greatly surprised and shocked that we on this
              side of the House should be continuing our opposition to this
              aspect of the implementation of the Belfast Agreement. We make no
              apology for our stance — that is the basis on which we were
              elected and we will continue to take that stance in this House.
              Those who express surprise, shock and horror are perhaps
              surprised, shocked and horrified that there is at least one
              Unionist party in the House that does stand by its election
              manifesto commitments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady had to admit that our amendment was
              a serious one and I give him credit for acknowledging that. He
              acknowledged more than his Colleague, Mr Dallat, who said that the
              amendment should not be taken seriously. Mr McGrady should have a
              word in Mr Dallat’s ear and let him know what an amendment is in
              parliamentary terms. I thank you for your assent to that, Eddie,
              well done. No doubt Mr Dallat will be going back to Coleraine
              Borough Council to explain why, having voted against an 8%
              regional rate increase, he is now in favour of it. He tells us it
              is because he has suddenly discovered that Mr Durkan found £31
              million. If, next year, he has to come back and take some money
              away, he might be running back to the Council to reverse his vote.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady told us that the fact that there
              were only two amendments was an indication of most parties’
              support for the Budget. Members will indicate their support for or
              rejection of the Budget when they vote. How we vote, rather than
              the number of amendments tabled, will determine whether there are
              people in the House who support the thrust of the Budget.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Sinn Féin/IRA party has also tabled an
              amendment and it has described people as being opportunistic. What
              could be more opportunistic than to agree the motion in the
              Executive and to support it throughout, never opposing it in
              Committees, but then to call for a reduction in the regional rate
              at the last minute, in terms almost identical to our amendment. It
              is clear where the opportunism lies. I heard one contributor from
              that party talk about having sympathy for Mr&nbsp;Durkan. With
              friends like that in the Executive, he deserves every piece of
              sympathy he can get.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was suggested that this should all be paid
              for out of Her Majesty’s Treasury. The interesting suggestion
              that Dublin should be asked to stump up as well, in addition to
              the taxpayers of Northern Ireland, was also mooted. Everybody
              should be asked to contribute, except those who were actually
              responsible over 30 years for most of the destruction, mayhem and
              economic deprivation in this country — IRA/Sinn Féin. They are
              the ones who brought many parts of this Province economically to
              its knees, and yet to listen to them, you would think that it was
              the fault of the British Government, the Unionists and everybody
              else. They are the ones who blew up factories and who murdered
              industrialists and employers. They are the ones who are
              responsible for much existing economic deprivation. <i>[Interruption]</p>

              were wrong, to take a point of information. He accused the DUP of
              actually appointing an MLA, as he put it, to serve on the special
              North/South EU programmes body. In fact, he got that absolutely

              yet we were totally opposed to it. We were suggesting that money
              be taken from it. Of course, he got that completely wrong. We are
              talking about the monitoring committees. People from all parties
              have been appointed to them. They are the transitional monitoring
              committee, the Peace II committee, and the overall structural
              funds monitoring committee. Today, however, we are dealing with
              the EU special programmes North/South implementation body. This is
              a completely different organisation on which, as I understand it,
              no MLA actually sits.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps Mr Durkan can again help his Friend
              understand that. One of the problems is that, having got it wrong,
              Mr ONeill is not now prepared to listen in order to learn
              something from it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of contributors have outlined
              criticisms of the Budget, not only in relation to the regional
              rate. Some Members have been very vocal outside this House. Some
              have been very concerned about the social aspects of the Budget,
              and the harm that it might do to very socially deprived people.
              Where have they been today? When asked to give a response to the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will, Mr Speaker. Each departmental Committee
              was asked to give a view on the priorities for spending within the
              Budget. Every Committee Chairperson responded, except Mr Cobain of
              the Social Development Committee, who has been waxing lyrical
              about the issue. He could not be bothered to respond on behalf of
              his Committee, nor could the Health Committee, which has not made
              a contribution here today either. The hypocrisy is staggering.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, there is no proposal, as was alleged
              by Ms Gildernew, to increase Housing Executive rents by GDP plus
              2%. I am sure that all those who have opposed the rent increase of
              GDP plus 2% — and I see them all on the Ulster Unionist Benches
              in particular — will now come and join us in the Lobbies to vote
              against an even larger increase in the regional rate, which
              affects all households in Northern Ireland. We are determined that
              whether people are in social housing or in private housing,
              whether they are in industry or are shopkeepers, they should not

              probably our longest ever debate on any individual motion. That is
              characteristic of financial and Budget debates, but the Minister
              has done the House the courtesy of remaining here throughout the

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To clarify the matter for Dr Paisley, it seems
              on these occasions we end up talking about water. My relationship
              with water, for the few minutes I was out, was not as a consumer.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I opened the debate, I looked forward to a
              vigorous but responsible discussion of the Budget, and I believe
              we have achieved that goal in the debate. Members’ contributions
              have ranged widely. They put their points clearly and forcefully.
              I have carefully noted these points.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to emphasise that the Budget vote
              tonight addresses the full range of our responsibilities and our
              total budget of £5·7 billion. There has been a good deal of
              focus on increases, particularly on those since the draft Budget,
              but we should remember that tonight we are voting on the Budget as
              a whole. We have been able to increase spending on agriculture to
              £200 million, spending on health to £2·3 billion, spending on
              education to £1·3 billion and spending on regional development
              to £460 million. The debate touched on many aspects of these
              budgets. Substantial increases and opportunities paint the total
              picture of this first Budget under devolution.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I emphasise at the outset that we are
              determined to improve the transparency of the processes of
              planning, evaluation and audit. We need good public service
              agreements at the planning stage before, during and after
              expenditure. We also need better information under resource
              accounting and budgeting. Through our own Public Accounts
              Committee we need a stronger and more appropriate audit. There is
              considerable scope for Assembly Committees to examine these
              issues. This should begin as early as possible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must now move to the final act of this
              debate. First, I propose to deal with the amendments. Secondly, I
              will deal with some general points made by Members. Finally, if
              time will allow, I will deal with as many of Members’ specific
              questions as possible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds proposed the first amendment on behalf
              of the DUP. It attempts to link cuts to the budgets of the
              North/South bodies to a reduction in the proposed increase in the
              regional rate. The amendment is designed to undermine the
              agreement and the basis of the institutional settlement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is facile to suggest there can be a
              reduction to the cost of the services assigned by agreement
              between the two Governments to these new bodies. The Northern
              contribution to their budgets in 2001-02 will be approximately
              £11·7 million. We are also proposing a major drive in the
              promotion of tourism through the new North/ South company which
              accounts for most of the £5·8 million we plan to spend on that
              area. Together with the small budgets for the North/South
              Ministerial Council Secretariat and the Civic Forum, the total for
              the function specified in the amendment is £18·5 million. Most
              of this spending relates to ongoing functions or arenas that make
              good commercial sense for the Northern Ireland economy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One wonders if the proponents of the amendment
              are proposing that these services be cut. What do they say about
              food safety? What about the promotion of tourism — surely we all
              want our waterways to be developed? The fact is that there is no
              real substance to this amendment, beyond the politics and the
              procedural rectitude. We have an agreement, the North/South bodies
              are part of that agreement, and they will be properly funded.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second amendment, introduced by Mr Maskey
              on behalf of Sinn Féin, also seeks to moderate the increase in
              the regional rate, this time by taking resources from the
              Executive programme funds. The Executive programme funds are
              central to the Budget and the Programme for Government. I
              re-emphasise that they constitute a new way of promoting the
              development, on a cross-cutting basis, of priorities set out in
              the Programme for Government. They will enable the Executive and
              the Assembly to make a real difference to the allocation of
              resources in the region.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stress that in creating the draft Budget, the
              Executive was disappointed that it was possible to put just £16
              million into the Executive programme funds for next year. We were
              glad to be able to supplement this with £9 million carried
              forward from the October monitoring round. This is because we want
              to make the best possible start to the work of the new funds, and
              to show strongly the devolution difference. The £25 million for
              the first year is essential if we are to make best use and lay the
              best plans for the more significant amounts of money that will
              come through in years two and three. The programme funds have to
              be allocated to services, and we will do this in the new year. The
              funds have been created as a response to our new circumstances.
              They are a positive and imaginative step forward, and they give us
              a means of showing, in important and effective ways, the
              devolution difference.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As has been pointed out, both amendments
              concern the regional rate. The Budget plans for 2001-02 are based
              on an assumed level of regional rate revenue of £334 million. To
              generate that revenue, it is estimated that regional rate
              increases of 8% in the domestic regional rate and 6·6 % in the
              non-domestic regional rate will be required next year. As I have
              already stated, the indicative allocations for 2002-03 and 2003-04
              would imply further increases of 8% in the domestic regional rate
              and 5·5% in the non-domestic regional rate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have declared those planned increases on the
              basis of current figures, just as I openly stated the proposed
              increases in the regional rate, both domestic and non- domestic,
              in the draft Budget. It is certainly not a stealth tax. We have
              been upfront, the issue has been well debated, and everybody has
              centred on it, in one way or another. It is a bit odd that an
              increase that has been made in such a transparent way — albeit
              not necessarily universally popular — should be branded stealth
              tax.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These increases are necessary to fund spending
              in the priority areas identified in the Programme for Government
              and in various Committee contributions. As I have already made
              clear, we cannot on the one hand say that the Barnett formula does
              not provide sufficient resources and on the other hand fail to try
              to raise further resources from revenue here. That would leave us
              open to the charge that we expect our services to be paid for by
              taxpayers in England, Scotland, Wales, the Irish Republic, and
              anywhere else, but that we do not seek funding from our own
              resources.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must recognise some points about the
              regional rate. Ratepayers in Northern Ireland make a much smaller
              contribution to the cost of local services than their counterparts
              in Great Britain. On average we only pay half as much, and of
              course we do not face a separate and additional charge for water
              and sewerage services. Even when the lower level of household
              income here is taken into account — and many Members have
              rightly stressed that point — we are still making a smaller
              contribution.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been pointed out that increases in the
              regional rate will increase poverty. The housing benefit system
              does, of course, provide protection for the most needy in society.
              Overall, about 186,000 people — around 31% of all households —
              receive some assistance with rate bills through rate rebates. The
              worse off are completely protected. I recognise that there are
              deficiencies in the regional rate, and I have recognised those
              before in this Chamber and in discussion with the Finance and
              Personnel Committee. That is why I have announced a comprehensive
              review that will look at all aspects of this tax, including the
              nature and range of reliefs that are available.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point has also been made that district
              councils are blamed unfairly for the regional rate. I agree that
              there must be clearer responsibility for the different components
              of the rates bill. We need to clarify the proportion of rates that
              will go to the district councils and how much will go to the
              services directly controlled by the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the outset, I said that the Executive accept
              responsibility for the rate increase as part of grown-up,
              realistic politics. I confirm that the Rates Collection Agency
              will take steps to distinguish between the regional and district
              rates in the rates bills for 2001-02 and in future years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The supporters of the first amendment sought to
              make much of the continuation of the uplift in the regional rate
              going on from the 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review. Have they
              forgotten how strongly some argued for the continuation of the
              increases in water and sewerage spending, which had initially been
              linked — as they so often reminded us — to those rate
              increases? The Executive have confirmed those increases in water
              and sewerage spending.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I point out that, from time to time, I have
              been urged to link the regional rate to water and sewerage
              expenditure and turn it, in part, into a water rate levied on
              households. It would be a household tax similar in form to the
              regional rate. I hope that some consistency is shown by those who
              preach to others.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were also concerns that the regional rate
              could become an issue akin to the poll tax. Apart from the
              unpopularity issue, I am at a loss to understand how this
              comparison is valid. Our rating system — with all its faults —
              is based on properties and households. It is not based on the
              taxation of individuals. We will need to look at the effects of
              the system on different types of households, including single
              householders, but I do not see any sign of such difficulties as
              the registration of individuals which the poll tax produced in
              England.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds indicated the opposition of Ministers
              to the increase in the regional rate. I am at a loss to recall the
              circumstances in which information including the proposals for the
              regional rate was circulated to all members of the Executive or
              when any representations came to me or to the First Minister or
              the Deputy First Minister in the terms suggested.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close suggested that we use in-year
              monitoring money to address increases in the regional rate. He
              misunderstands the nature of monitoring expenditure during the
              course of a year and planning expenditure for future years.
              In-year changes can rise or fall. This year’s pattern is not
              guaranteed and prudent planning is required. That means taking
              sensible decisions based on the information available at the time
              of each decision. It would be imprudent to anticipate that money
              might become available from end-year slippage or end-year
              flexibility. Our view is that it is better to take any benefits
              that come from emerging underspends as and when they might arise.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional rate will be finalised early in
              the new year. We will then need to set a final rate that will
              produce — on the best available information — the level of
              revenue that we adopt in this Budget. Members will recall that
              last February it was possible to reduce the percentage uplift in
              the non-domestic regional rate below that which I had indicated in
              the draft Budget statement last December because the forecast
              yield was slightly higher than previous forecasts. Therefore, we
              will keep this under review in the same way this year. The
              regional rate will be examined, but the job will be done properly.
              These amendments are not the proper way to proceed, and
              accordingly, I ask the Assembly to reject them.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will now turn to some general points about
              the Budget raised by Members. Mr Dodds expressed concern about the
              adverse effects of the Barnett formula, as did Mr Maskey, Mr
              Molloy, Ms McWilliams and Ms Lewsley. As the debate went on,
              nearly every Member who made a contribution recognised the case in
              relation to the Barnett formula. The Executive have made clear its
              concern about the Barnett formula. That point has been stressed by
              the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, not just here
              but in other locations as well.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The formula is now over 20 years old and has
              outlived its usefulness. We cannot accept that a formula, which is
              only based on population and ignores wider needs, is satisfactory
              for our funding requirements. Our views have been made known to
              Treasury Ministers and to others. By the time of the next UK
              spending review, we hope to have the basis of a new arrangement
              that suits our needs better, and is more acceptable to this
              Assembly’s Members. However, I do not wish the Assembly to
              believe that this will be a simple task. The formula is clearly
              well entrenched in the Treasury. Again, I stress that we will do
              ourselves no favour in this argument by avoiding resource
              decisions — difficult though they may be — that are within our
              remit, such as that on the regional rate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members, particularly Mr Dodds, Mr Molloy,
              Mr P Robinson, Mr Close, Mr B Bell and Ms McWilliams expressed
              disappointment about the restricted timetable for this Budget. I
              indicated before that the time available for consideration of this
              year’s Budget has been regrettably constrained. As the Assembly
              knows, there was a UK spending review during the year, and that
              meant that there was not a clear indication of the total resources
              available. As soon as possible thereafter, we moved to bring
              forward a draft Budget. Within the time that was available, I
              believe that all that was possible was done to facilitate
              meaningful consultation with the Assembly and outside groups.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Departments have worked closely with their
              Committees, and I would like, once again, to record my own thanks
              to the Finance and Personnel Committee for facilitating the Budget
              debate in November and for its report to me.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were also able to hold two conferences on
              the equality dimension of the Budget — one in Derry and one in
              Belfast. Over 100 groups were invited to these conferences, and
              the needs of minorities were met by providing summaries of the
              draft Budget in alternative formats. Next year the process can
              start earlier, thus giving more time for the Budget proposals to
              be scrutinised by the Assembly and accessed by wider community
              interests.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of departmental running costs was
              raised by several Members. The Executive are committed to a full
              re-examination of Departments’ costs and those of the wider
              public sector. We face an enormous range of pressures on spending,
              and the efficient and economic use of resources must be promoted.
              It is important to note that the increase in costs between 2000-01
              and 2001-02 — <i>[Interruption.]</p>
              </i><b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. While I understand that Members may want
              to have a brief and quiet word with each other from time to time,
              there is a constant hum of conversation, which is unfair to other
              Members and the Minister. If Members wish to have conversations, I
              ask them to go to the Members’ Lobby or somewhere close by.
              Please give the rest of the House and the Minister an opportunity.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, Mr Speaker. Why stop close by if you
              can go beyond the range of the Division Bell later?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to note that the increase in
              costs shown in the Budget paper between 2000-01 and 2001-02
              reflects the basic requirement to provide for the cost of
              employing staff to deliver services to the public. Also, the
              2000-01 figures understated the actual level of spending, because
              they exclude the additions that the Executive agreed in July. The
              Executive have made realistic provision for the costs of
              Departments in 2001-02.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once again we are in a position from which we
              cannot will the end — to provide good service to the public and
              to the Assembly — without willing the means. The truth is that
              the needs of the new institutions, including the needs of
              Committees, and the needs of many Members in relation to asking
              questions, have created a major increase in workload for
              Departments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The creation of the new institutions results in
              a great increase in accountability, which is one of the most
              important steps away from the pattern of direct rule. That has a
              cost. We need to recognise that, though we also need to ensure
              restraint. I welcome Members’ consideration in that regard.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were also a number of more specific
              questions raised during the debate. In particular, Mr Peter
              Robinson raised the matter of roads capital funding, and wondered
              if, on raising it for a third time, circumstances would allow me
              to answer. I can confirm that the Budget for 2001-02, which we are
              voting on this evening, contains all that the Department for
              Regional Development sought for roads capital expenditure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can also confirm that while the Chancellor’s
              initiative funding does decrease in subsequent years, the
              indicative allocations for 2002-03 and 2003-04 for mainstream
              roads capital funding provide for an uplift of over one third on
              the 2001-02 allocation. In addition, there are the substantial
              resources in the Executive infrastructure fund, through which the
              Department for Regional Development can bid for road schemes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland questioned the approach to the
              planning of the Budgets for the years 2002-03 and 2003-04. The
              position is that the figures set out in the Budget are indicative
              and will need to be reviewed fully in the next Budget cycle. I
              have undertaken that there will be fuller scrutiny next year. It
              follows that there should be genuine scope for these plans to be
              revised next year, but the published figures, rounded to the
              nearest £10&nbsp;million, show the basis on which we are
              currently planning.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds pointed to the increase in the figures
              for departmental running costs. We need to be careful when
              interpreting these figures. They now include the costs of running
              Welfare-to-Work programmes, which were previously accounted for
              separately. Also, it is wrong to assume that all increases in
              departmental running costs simply add to bureaucracy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Large amounts of departmental running costs go
              towards providing services to the public. For example, in the
              Department for Social Development — one of the Departments that
              Mr Close was targeting in his remarks on departmental running
              costs — some £12·5&nbsp;million of a rise of
              £18·6&nbsp;million has been allocated for the implementation of
              the Welfare Modernisation Programme. That programme is designed to
              provide work for those who can work, and security for those who
              cannot.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the Department of Higher and
              Further Education, Training and Employment, the allocation
              proposed includes an additional £2·25&nbsp;million in 2001-02 to
              meet the cost of the PFI contract for the provision of IT
              services. That increase is required because provision was
              inadequate to meet existing demands for Phases I and II of the
              contract. In addition, Phase III has recently been negotiated to
              allow for a significant increase from 500 to 1,150 in the number
              of simultaneous system users. Those facilities are vital to the
              proper functioning of the Department and its jobcentre network.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Questions were raised about the peace dividend
              — the matter was raised first by Mr Molloy and followed up by
              other Members. Our Budget is quite separate from that of the NIO.
              We do not have to make any contribution to the cost of reforming
              the Police Service and the Prison Service. We are also protected
              from any pressures arising from the review of criminal justice or,
              indeed, any other aspect of NIO business. In short, it is unlikely
              that any available savings will fall to us during the period of
              this spending review.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Questions were also raised — again, the issue
              was first raised by Mr Molloy — about the acute services review,
              and why provision had not been made for this in the Budget. The
              independent review group, appointed by the Minister of Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety and chaired by
              Maurice&nbsp;Hayes, is due to report by the end of February. After
              that there will be, as the Minister has indicated, wide public
              consultation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will need to carefully assess the cost of
              the emerging strategies to ensure that what we propose is
              affordable. The Budget allocations for 2002-03 and 2003-04 are
              indicative and we will have to decide how best to address the
              costs of the acute services strategy as part of next year’s
              Budget considerations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy, Mr Gallagher and several other
              Members raised the issue of the rural community. There are
              significant increases in the Budget for agriculture and rural
              development. It is planned to provide £193 million, an increase
              of £28·7 million over 2000-01. Even allowing for distortions in
              animal disease compensation and considering that provision for
              less favoured areas (LFAs) is normally adjusted during the year,
              the increase for 2001-02 is £16·8 million, or 10·2%. That
              allocation will provide for, among other things, the introduction
              of a scrapie eradication programme, the launching of the beef
              quality initiative and business development and training. The
              allocation also includes £3·9 million for match funding relating
              to modulation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members appeared to suggest that those
              programmes are not directly benefiting farmers, and therefore do
              not count. I hazard to guess that if that money were not put into
              those schemes, members of the farming community would soon tell us
              of the importance of those schemes to their continued operation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Bell, and other Members, raised the matter
              of housing funding. I assure him that the Executive do not regard
              housing as a low-priority matter and that the Housing Executive
              budget is not being cut. The Programme for Government contains the
              commitment to work to provide high quality and affordable social
              housing for those on low incomes. We spend two-and- a-half times
              more on housing than is spent in England. Therefore, on any
              objective basis, it continues to be given priority. For 2001-02
              the Housing Executive budget is being increased by £6·5 million
              and the budget for housing associations will rise by £1·5
              million. All told, housing funding will rise by 4·3%.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will be aware that in past monitoring
              rounds we have continued to respond to particular pressures in the
              housing programme. So long as resources are available in future
              monitoring rounds we will continue to respond to those pressures
              and ensure the best possible spend of the available money.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford, among others, suggested that there is
              nothing new in the Programme for Government. On the contrary,
              there is much that is new. Local politicians have agreed on
              actions across a range of local public services that directly
              affect local people’s lives. Priorities have been set out for
              Northern Ireland’s future for which we will use the resources
              available to improve people’s health, education skills to create
              jobs, tackle disadvantage and protect the environment. We have set
              out challenges that need to be addressed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government also explains the
              importance to Northern Ireland’s future of co-operation for
              mutual benefit — north and south, east and west, with Europe and
              America. In short, we are getting down to the business of
              improving the services to the community for which Ministers are
              responsibility.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams asked when the regional
              development strategy would be published. The Programme for
              Government commits the Executive to agreeing a regional
              development strategy and seeking the Assembly’s agreement by
              spring 2001.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams also claimed that the Executive
              have no information on the number of children living in poverty on
              which to base their spending plans. She rightly identified that as
              a matter for Mr Morrow.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, although some information is available
              here on child poverty from the family expenditure survey, the main
              survey used in Great&nbsp;Britain for investigating poverty is not
              carried out in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. I am advised that the
              extension of the family resources survey to Northern&nbsp;Ireland
              is currently being considered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr&nbsp;Birnie raised matters relating to
              student support concerning how the proposals address equal
              opportunities issues and how information flows can be improved.
              With regard to how the proposals address equal opportunities
              issues, the package of measures announced by Dr&nbsp;Farren is
              designed to ensure that more students from lower income
              backgrounds have access to further and higher education. These
              measures will open up access to further and higher education for
              many more people who would not have previously considered
              participation and, therefore, will help to promote much greater
              equality of opportunity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On how information flows can be improved, I
              draw Members’ attention again to Dr&nbsp;Farren’s statement of
              last Friday. He announced that he asked officials to work with the
              education and library boards and student representatives to
              develop material for advice to potential students on financial
              matters. Ms&nbsp;McWilliams also raised the issue about the
              Department of Education and consultation before selling land in
              South Belfast. That sale was carried out as part of the provision
              of a new school for Wellington College, which is being provided
              under the private finance initiative.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the bidding process the Belfast
              Education and Library Board negotiated a value-for-money deal with
              Northwin Construction Limited, which included the transfer of land
              at full market value. The board is not required to consult on the
              sale of the land, but I understand that the development of any
              surplus land at the school is subject to the normal planning
              procedures, and that is only right.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the use of private finance
              initiative solutions, we have to be receptive to new ways of
              securing the services that our community needs. These deals are
              looked at very carefully to ensure value for money.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Roche asked, in certain terms, why the
              Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development did not lift the ban
              on BSE when she had the opportunity. The Minister has never been
              in a position to lift the BSE ban in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. That
              ban was imposed by the European Union and can only be lifted by
              the European Union. The Minister has made every effort, since
              taking office, to have the ban in Northern&nbsp;Ireland removed or
              relaxed. However, the current climate relating to BSE across
              Europe makes it unwise to raise the case now. The Minister has
              made it abundantly clear that she will take the case forward as
              soon as the climate is right, and that commitment is clear cut.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some concerns were also raised about the Health
              Service’s budget, including arrangements for funding the boards
              and trusts and, in particular, some Members followed up
              Ms&nbsp;McWilliams’s point on the whole notion of audit trails.
              No one can deny that the system for the management of boards and
              trusts is complex, yet it is essential that these organisations
              and structures are best suited to our needs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now that devolution has been achieved, there is
              a recognised need to consider the efficiency of all existing
              public administration structures. The Executive are committed to
              doing this through the Programme for Government.
              Ms&nbsp;McWilliams also queried the apparent reduction in the
              capital budget for the Department of Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety. The Budget contains revised figures for the
              Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety’s
              capital budget compared with the October draft. The revised
              figures do not alter the Department’s spending power.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following the publication of the draft Budget
              some technical adjustments had to be made to facilitate the move
              to resource budgeting. These resulted in a shift of provision from
              capital to resource. This reflects more accurately the new
              resource budgeting classifications and does not affect the
              spending power on the ground. Since the draft Budget was
              announced, an additional £5&nbsp;million has been allocated to
              the Department of Health’s capital budget in 2001-02. The
              Executive programme funds will offer further opportunities for
              capital expenditure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed closure of Downe Hospital was also
              raised. Generally, our hospitals serve much smaller populations
              than those elsewhere in the UK, and many are in need of
              modernization, as Members will agree. With expert staff so widely
              dispersed, the viability of some smaller hospitals has come into
              question. The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public
              Safety — <i>[Interruption.]</p>
              </i><b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. Not content with disturbing the peace,
              some Members are disturbing the furniture as well. Please allow
              the Minister to speak.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In preparing its report, the review group
              appointed by the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public
              Safety will be expected to take into account the views of
              individuals, organizations and groups which have an interest or
              involvement in the provision of hospital services. We will need to
              develop a strategy for acute services, and that strategy will have
              to be costed, for consideration in next year’s Budget
              negotiations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams also raised the question of
              funding for provision for mental health and children. In 2001-02,
              there will be an additional £4 million to help address the gaps
              in community services to people with severe and enduring mental
              illnesses and learning disabilities; that should significantly
              reduce hospital admissions. An extra £3·5 million has been
              allocated in 2001-02, to facilitate the implementation of ‘Children
              Matter’ in areas such as learning care, adoptions, and
              preventive care services. Finally, the children’s fund will
              provide the Executive with a useful means of providing support for
              children in need and youth at risk. The Deputy First Minister has
              already said that consideration would be given to the proposal for
              a children’s commissioner, possibly funded out of Executive
              programme funds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Provision for victims is a matter of
              considerable concern to the Executive Committee, particularly to
              the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. Their Department
              has specific responsibility for making sure that all Departments
              give due consideration to the needs of victims. The Executive aim
              to put a cross-departmental strategy in place, to ensure that high
              quality help and services are available to meet the needs of
              victims. The Executive have already agreed to provide £200,000
              this year to get work under way to identify the needs of victims
              and raise public awareness of those needs. It is also anticipated
              that funding from the European Union’s Peace II programme will
              be available for a programme for victims. Once the strategy is in
              place and the Peace II position is clear, we will be better placed
              to identify the additional resources required.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was asked, not least by Mr Roche, to confirm
              that the student support proposals were well thought through.
              Although the findings of the student support review are still
              under consideration, the Executive have taken the view that
              resources should be made available now to meet the most pressing
              needs. In the next few weeks, further proposals will be subject to
              policy appraisal and evaluation, to ensure that they are effective
              and can meet their objectives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was also asked how the Minister for Higher
              and Further Education, Training and Employment could make an
              announcement on student support in advance of the decision on the
              allocation of the Executive programme funds. The position was set
              out clearly in my statement last week: the Executive have
              definitely agreed an allocation of £5 million for 2001-02, £7
              million for 2002-03, and £8 million for 2003-04 for some key
              aspects of the review.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have also set aside further money in the New
              Directions fund, which is our way of showing clearly that there is
              further provision available for aspects of the student support
              review after the details have been considered further by the
              Executive. The Executive’s decision on these resources, and on
              other aspects of the Executive programme funds, will be decided
              and announced in the new year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady, Dr Paisley and Mr Shannon asked
              what could be done to assist the fishing industry. The Budget
              allocates £125,000 per annum to cover costs associated with the
              Cod Recovery Plan. In addition, the Minister announced her
              intention to formulate a scheme to assist the decommissioning of
              fishing vessels — you know why I took a gulp of water before I
              got to that word. The quota cuts made at the December meeting of
              the EU Fisheries Council now make this a top priority.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley commented that Bríd Rodgers was not
              supported by other UK agriculture Ministers on the issue of quota
              cuts. On the one hand, I welcome the fact that there was no
              attempt by the Chairman of the Committee to apportion blame.
              However, negotiating priorities are jointly determined by all the
              United Kingdom’s Ministers who are responsible for fisheries. I
              am glad that Dr Paisley appreciates that the Minister has done her
              best.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland raised the issue of health costs,
              which he said needed to be reviewed. There are many demands upon
              the health budget, and it has to respond to the increasing health
              demands of an ageing population, costs of modern medicine and
              greater public awareness and concern about heath issues. To
              deliver the necessary services to the public, the structure of
              boards and trusts must be best suited to our needs and that is
              relevant to the consideration of a wider public administration
              review.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members have raised the issue of the
              projected increase in the Housing Executive rents. The discussions
              on the Budget have been based on the assumption that rents would
              increase by 2% more than the rate of inflation, which is forecast
              by the Treasury as being 2%. I have looked further at the cost
              implications of this and, following further scrutiny, it does
              appear that the difference between a real increase in line with
              inflation at the GDP deflator, plus 2%, would be £5 million —
              not the £7·8 million, which I reported last Tuesday. That figure
              was a revision of the £5·4 million I reported previous to that.
              I am saying this before anyone else might take the reins and try
              to do an announcement trail on this.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final decision on the rent increase is a
              matter for the Minister for Social Development. The Executive are
              proposing a budget for the Housing Executive, which is £6·5
              million higher than in 2000-01, and an increase of 5.3%. This
              funding more than reverses the £3 million reduction proposed by
              the Labour Government, which had been built in to the plans we
              inherited on devolution. I recognise, as many Members have
              stressed today and on other occasions, the strong concern to
              ensure that we carry through with proper investment in social
              housing, particularly in relation to the Housing Executive’s
              budget. I also recognise the particular pressures and challenges
              faced by the Housing Executive. We have tried before, in
              monitoring rounds this year, to make good those other pressures as
              they arise, as well as making this significant commitment to the
              annual Budget.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several points were raised about the public
              service agreements and the regional rate. I think it was Mr Ford
              who alleged that, in relation to the regional rate, we are simply
              following a catch-up policy. The proposed increases on the
              regional rate are needed to generate the resources that the
              Executive deem necessary to deliver their priorities. The
              estimates of how great the increase in rate poundage should be
              will be kept under review. These increases will be adjusted if
              there is greater buoyancy than we have allowed for.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public service agreements are vital to the
              effective and efficient pursuit of our objectives. The Office of
              the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and the
              Department of Finance and Personnel have joint responsibility to
              work with Departments on developing public service agreements and
              policing them.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley raised points about our proposals
              for providing free travel for elderly people. As you will know,
              the Executive are committed to introducing free travel for older
              people in the Programme for Government. Provision of £4 million
              has been made in 2002-03 and 2003-04 to take this important new
              proposal forward, subject to a full policy appraisal.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Points were raised about finance for road
              gritting by Mr Bradley and Ms Morrice. The Budget contains
              provision to sustain the current programme of road gritting,
              however, prioritization within this programme is, of course, a
              matter for the Minister for Regional Development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea, as Chairperson of the
              Environment Committee, raised a number of issues. He acknowledged
              the fact that the Environment and Heritage Service is enjoying an
              increase of over 30% more than the funding provided in the current
              year. This will allow for the first stage of a progressive
              implementation of European environmental legislation. We cannot do
              everything we wish to do immediately, especially when faced with a
              range of competing priorities. Nevertheless, I can assure the
              Member that a major part of the additional funding will help
              district councils meet the cost of their obligations under the
              waste management strategy, as has already been provided for in
              Great Britain.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also note the reference to the moratorium on
              the historic building grant applications. In fact, the extra
              in-year allocations to this area should enable an earlier lifting
              of this moratorium, but the precise timing is a matter for the
              Minister of the Environment. Rev Dr William McCrea also mentioned
              the possibility of European infraction proceedings because of the
              backlog in implementing European legislation. The substantial
              increase in this area demonstrates the Executive’s determination
              to move quickly to eliminate the backlog. If, despite this
              evidence, infraction proceedings are taken, we will address the
              issue of any resulting costs at that time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Issues were also raised about the overall
              underfunding, as it was put, of the Department of Culture, Arts
              and Leisure. Mr ONeill asked why no funding was provided to buy
              out commercial fishing nets or to improve safety in road racing.
              While I acknowledge that only 25% of the Department of Culture,
              Arts and Leisure’s bids for funding were met, all bids are
              considered according to relative priorities and not on the
              proportion of bids submitted by each Department. This year the
              Executive have recommended that the Department’s budget be
              increased by 7·8% compared to last year, and I should point out
              that this is the fourth highest increase proposed in the Budget.
              In addition to the Budget allocations, the Department will also
              have the opportunity to bid for funding under the Executive
              programme funds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the buying out of commercial
              fishing nets, although the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure
              submitted a bid for funding, its policy in this area is still
              being developed. Until the policy is developed and evaluated, the
              Executive cannot consider allocating funds, as we are not yet able
              to determine a relative priority of the policy within the
              Programme for Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as improving safety in road racing is
              concerned, the Department is currently consulting with interested
              parties and has set up a working group to look at addressing the
              long-term safety of motorcycle racing on both road and track.
              Until the policy in this area has been developed and evaluated,
              the Executive are, again, unable to allocate funds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close asked about receipts from the sale of
              Housing Executive houses. Additional receipts from all sources
              need to be looked at in the context of the most pressing needs
              across all our programmes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would not be sensible to assume that they
              should be allocated to the area from which they have arisen. Not
              all Departments have an equal ability to generate receipts. The
              present practice ensures that their needs can be taken into
              account when the allocation of additional receipts is considered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh asked where the increase of £7
              million — which was allocated to the Department of Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety since the draft October Budget
              — will be spent. The capital budget for next year has been
              increased by £5 million, and an additional recurrent £2 million
              has been allocated to the acute services budget. The precise
              distribution will be determined by the Minister for Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh raised an issue which had been
              mentioned earlier by Mr P Robinson. He said that free travel for
              the elderly would do little for those living in rural areas
              because they currently have few public transport services. As I
              said earlier, a policy appraisal of the proposal is awaited. The
              Executive will want the differential impact and benefits of free
              travel to be properly appraised.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage and others expressed concerns about
              the effects of European Union funding. The Executive have to work
              within the total allocation of funding set by the Treasury. That
              includes the amounts available on a ring-fenced basis for the
              Peace II programme, for which we are especially grateful to the
              European Union. The Executive are able to work alongside the
              European Union on programmes such as community initiatives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In these instances, and in aspects of
              transitional Objective 1 funding, we have decided to allocate
              additional funding within our departmental expenditure limit,
              because we can support those actions on their own merits. For
              example, the urban community initiative initiates actions that we
              support. Furthermore, we have provided for complimentary actions
              to be listed among the bids on the Executive programme funds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr has challenged the costs arising
              from the structures of Government. This demonstrates a failure to
              recognise the sheer value of having a local administration. There
              are 11 Departments in the Assembly, and this structure makes for
              substantial scrutiny and accountability of the workings of
              Government. This is a major change for the better, by comparison
              with the restoration of direct rule, where we had no
              accountability at this level. Some of the more prolific
              questioners of that accountability should bear in mind that every
              activity in this Assembly, at both Committee and individual level,
              does have a bearing on departmental running costs and does bear
              down on other performance aspects.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were also asked by Mr McHugh and Mr Poots
              about whether the allocation for the Department of Agriculture and
              Rural Development should be spent on administration costs, rather
              than on farmers. In the past, the Department has run capital grant
              schemes for farmers. However, the time is not appropriate to ask
              farmers to contribute further to such schemes. Instead, the
              Department aims to increase education and training, information
              technology, and to introduce a focus on quality competitiveness,
              such as in beef quality. To that end, the Budget provides for
              important work, including the launch of the beef quality
              initiative, business development, education and training for
              farmers, and the introduction of the scrapie eradication
              programme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The £2 million per annum funding of the beef
              quality initiative is an example of a successful idea emerging
              from the expert vision group set up by Ms Rodgers to develop a
              strategic vision for the future development of the entire agri-food
              industry. With regard to Mr McHugh’s other queries, there is
              scope for an increase in administration to deliver all of the
              Department’s statutory obligations, including a satisfactory
              equality scheme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On modulation, the Budget provides for farmers’
              money to be matched pound for pound by the Treasury, which will
              bring more money into the Northern Ireland economy and to the
              agriculture industry as a whole. The Department will be consulting
              with farmers’ bodies about the use of modulation money and match
              funding for the 2003-04 period. Also, the payment of compensation
              is an important element in the control of animal disease, ensuring
              that farmers report outbreaks early so that effective remedial
              action can be taken.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage asked what Ms Rodgers was doing about
              the crisis in farm incomes. The increase in the allocation to the
              Department of Agriculture and Rural Development provides very
              substantive evidence of the Executive’s commitment to farming.
              There will also be significant funding allocated through European
              subsidies, which will be additional to this budget.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr queried waste, and pointed in
              particular to the £2,000 spent on a cross-border rural
              development group. I know that the Minister of Agriculture
              supports that proposal to build stronger rural communities on a
              cross-border basis. She also supports the proposal for the new
              peace maze in Northern Ireland, which is funded by the peace and
              reconciliation fund, because of its particularly strong
              cross-community appeal to young and old alike. She considers both
              to be valuable initiatives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford queried the indicative allocations in
              the Budget for free travel for the elderly and the question of the
              remainder falling on district councils. The estimated cost of
              existing half-fares scheme is £4 million. On that basis, the
              increased travel by the elderly due to the availability of free
              travel is likely to raise the full fare cost to £11 million.
              However, as I said before, a policy appraisal is awaited. A common
              feature of free travel schemes is that the operator should not be
              placed in a better position than he would have been had the scheme
              not existed. In other words, he should not gain because an empty
              seat is now occupied by someone travelling free. On that basis,
              the cost of free travel to the public purse is still far from
              clear. Against that background, the Executive have proposed that
              funding of twice the current level should be made available. The
              rest, if any, will come from district councils, based on an
              assessment of the benefit that their residents enjoy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford also asked about a public/private
              partnership for Translink. Obviously, that is initially a matter
              for the Department for Regional Development, but we must recognise
              that a single monopoly that is not exposed to competition is
              unlikely to provide the most efficient service delivery, and
              forthcoming European legislation could well force change. I am
              sure that, in scrutinizing proposals, the Department for Regional
              Development, the Executive and the Assembly will recognise the
              problems created by the highly fragmented railway privatization in
              Britain. I hope that Members are assured on that point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat, among others, referred to problems
              with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service Trust. The additional
              allocation of £1 million to the service’s budget in 2001-02
              will fund the replacement of the existing vehicles, thereby
              contributing to the fleet’s modernization. The recently
              completed strategic review of the ambulance service highlighted a
              range of problems. We will need to consider carefully what options
              exist to address these. The outcome of the review into the acute
              hospital sector will also be relevant in defining future needs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice commended the decision to fund
              recruitment of road safety education officers, increasing their
              number from 11 to 21, and more significant investment in road
              safety promotion issues. That investment has enabled the
              Department of Environment to reinforce its key road safety
              messages. More importantly perhaps, the Department of the
              Environment, in conjunction with others across Government, is
              currently preparing a new road safety strategic plan for the
              period 2001-10. A consultation document will be published shortly,
              and I am sure that what Ms Morrice properly calls &quot;a life and
              death issue&quot; will be fully and rigorously addressed in that
              review.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice also sought further information
              about the allocation of funding to victims, women’s issues and
              community relations. The Budget provides for the work of the
              Office of the First and Deputy First Minister, and that includes
              funding for community relations, and the promotion of gender and
              equality issues. As I mentioned earlier, the draft Programme for
              Government aims to put in place a cross-departmental strategy to
              ensure that the needs of victims are properly met.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy is anxious that we address the
              backlog of repairs to the school estate in future years and
              arrange retainer payments for term-time staff. The Executive
              recognise the importance of maintaining safe and appropriate
              school facilities, and has allocated an additional £10·5 million
              for that purpose this year. I assure the Assembly that the
              Executive will continue to address the inherited backlog in
              repairs when allocating Executive programme funds and constructing
              the Budget in future years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Gildernew asked about the impact of the
              reduction in urban regeneration and community development funding.
              While the mainstream funding is falling by £3·1 million as the
              94/99 EU Single Programme comes to an end, there is an increase in
              EU Peace funding of £6·2 million. In addition, there will also
              be £6 million in the social inclusion community regeneration
              Executive programme funds if the Sinn Féin amendment does not
              succeed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Gildernew then went on to say that receipts
              from the sale of Housing Executive houses had been returned to the
              British Exchequer. In fact, all receipts from Housing Executive
              house sales have become available to spend in Northern Ireland, on
              housing or other programmes. Decisions on where that money should
              be allocated are taken by the Executive and ultimately by the
              Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots commented on some aspects of the
              budget for the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and laid
              particular emphasis on library capital works. Responsibility for
              determining which projects should be given priority within that
              budget lies with the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure. It
              would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to comment on any
              particular library, much as Mr Poots might want me to do so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir suggested that the increase in the
              regional rate could be forgone simply by reducing departmental
              running costs. This relies on the assumption that departmental
              running costs are spent on bureaucracy. I emphasise that that is
              far from the case, as many front line public services, such as
              roads; water and sewerage; environmental services and the payment
              of benefits are met from these costs. It would be impossible to
              make the sort of reductions that are being called for without
              cutting back on these and other vital public services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In revisiting some points that he had made in
              winding up the substantive debate on the draft Budget, Mr Leslie
              emphasised the benefits of housing investments. At present, sales
              of houses are running at record levels, and far from reducing
              investment in housing, the Budget produces a 4·2% increase next
              year in housing provision. We have already indicated our
              determination to ensure that our housing programme continues to
              target social need. Despite the comments from some Members,
              housing continues to be a priority for the Executive. We also have
              to make sure that we pursue that priority alongside the many other
              competing measures we are advocating. We will continue to keep
              that point and other matters under review as regards future budget
              rounds and monitoring rounds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have tried to cover most of the issues raised
              in this debate. Some points were more substantive than others. Any
              that I have not covered I will follow up by letter, regardless of
              how Members vote on either the amendments or the Budget.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to pay tribute to all the Members who
              participated in the debate. It has been a useful exercise and has
              demonstrated that this Assembly is functioning as an Assembly
              should. There has been the challenge of alternative perspectives.
              Different opinions have been aired. I did not come here with the
              expectation that the Budget would be a lap of honour, either for
              the Executive or myself.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Proposed amendments have focused on one
              particular aspect — the regional rate. Most of the offerings
              have tended either to indicate some approval and welcome of the
              increases that the Executive have been able to afford to various
              programmes, or to ask for more expenditure on others. I am at a
              loss to understand how we could meet all the demands and
              suggestions for even more expenditure, when we are also under
              pressure, through the proposed amendments in relation to the
              regional rate, to reduce the resources available to us. I have
              said previously how I liken these occasions to close encounters of
              the absurd kind. We have seen some of that again. We are being
              asked to reduce the resources available to us, and at the same
              time increase expenditure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, I recognise that people have
              their own case to put and their own role to play. I have a
              particular role as the Minister of Finance and Personnel, and I
              hope to discharge that properly on behalf of, and on a good
              working basis with, all my ministerial colleagues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want, as some other Members did today, to pay
              tribute to all my ministerial Colleagues for the contribution that
              they have made to the first Budget round. They have all put
              forward good cases. They all made bids, as their respective
              departmental Committees know. Unfortunately, the Executive do not
              have the resources available to meet all of those bids, and that
              is why we have had to develop a budget exercise very much informed
              by the key priority setting of the Programme for Government. In
              paying tribute to my ministerial Colleagues, I want to pay tribute
              to all the other members of the Executive Committee who have
              deliberated on the Budget decisions with us. We have taken these
              decisions collectively. I pay tribute, in particular, to the work
              of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in overseeing and
              in sharing in, not just this Budget round, but also the important
              work on the Programme for Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate that Members are still saying that
              they would like to see more of the public service agreements
              before voting on the Budget. However, let us be clear — the
              public service agreements will be coming forward to the Assembly
              in detailed form in January. We cannot really do anything about
              those public service agreements until we have confirmed the
              Budget. Their finalisation will be on the basis of the Budget
              lines confirmed here, and will set things out in a more meaningful
              way than we have been able to do in the tables so far. Members
              have rightly said that some of the more meaningful detail is
              absent from the Budget at this stage. That more meaningful detail
              should be available and set out in the public service agreements,
              which will form part of a consolidated Programme for Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hence, the requirement in the agreement for the
              Assembly to be able to vote on a Programme for Government that
              incorporates an agreed Budget will be fulfilled. This is an
              important stage in that process. We have a Budget that is derived
              from a Programme for Government. It is not the end of the process.
              Confirming the Budget will lead to the further elaboration of the
              Programme for Government and will fulfil the information needs
              that many Members have outlined.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that Committee members will further
              pursue the details of the public service agreements and the valid
              concerns that they have indicated. Through the Committees, they
              can ensure the best use of resources. People should not wait for a
              flag to fall from me, or from the Department of Finance and
              Personnel, before they scrutinise those issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tonight we must decide if we are to confirm the
              Budget for next year. Indicative figures, consistent with the
              priorities reflected in the Programme for Government, have been
              provided for the following two years. I ask the Assembly to reject
              these amendments. They would damage the Budget, and, specifically,
              its realisation of our commitments to North/South structures under
              the Good Friday Agreement, and to the key priorities set out by
              the Executive in the Programme for Government. Having rejected
              both amendments, I also ask the Assembly to strongly endorse our
              first Budget under devolution.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendments will be taken in the proper
              order — first, number 2, then number 1 — followed by the
              motion in the form then agreed. If the motion has not been
              amended, it will be taken as on the Order Paper. As I reminded the
              House at the start of the day, it is clear from section 64(2) of
              the Northern Ireland Act (1998) that votes on the draft Budget
              require cross-community support. Until now, in the case of all
              propositions requiring cross-community support it had to be clear
              that there were no votes against; otherwise the Chair has pressed
              the House for Division. However, at this late hour I am hesitant
              to put the House to unnecessary and time-consuming Divisions. If
              it appears absolutely clear to the Chair that a proposal has not
              achieved a cross-community vote, I will so declare following the
              collection of voices. However, if it is challenged in the normal
              way by restating, then I will call for a Division. If it is not
              necessary to have a Division, I will not press the House to do so.
              The matter is in the hands of Members.</p>
