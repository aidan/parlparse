              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received notice from the Minister of
              Culture, Arts and Leisure that he wishes to make a statement on
              the North/South Ministerial Council sectoral meeting on inland
              waterways, held on 26 June 2002 in Belfast.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr
              McGimpsey):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fifth meeting of the North/South
              Ministerial Council in inland waterways sectoral format took place
              in Belfast on Wednesday 26 June 2002.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following nomination by the First Minister and
              the Deputy First Minister, Ms Carmel Hanna and I represented the
              Northern Ireland Executive. Mr Éamon Ó Cuív TD, Minister for
              Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs represented the Irish
              Government. I am making this report on behalf of myself and Ms
              Hanna who has approved the report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The meeting opened with a progress report from
              the chief executive of Waterways Ireland, Mr John Martin. The
              Council noted that Waterways Ireland’s budget for 2002 is
              £23·44 million, and that the Northern Ireland contribution is
              £3·92 million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Martin advised that major capital projects
              on the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal were progressing
              satisfactorily. The programme of work on the Shannon Navigation
              had been delayed as a result of planning appeals, but those have
              been resolved. Progress was also made on upgrading mooring
              facilities on the Lough Erne and Lower Bann Navigations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Martin reported that Waterways Ireland has
              had a series of meetings with user groups, including the Erne
              Charter Boat Association and the Irish Boat Rental Association.
              Consultants are currently preparing a marketing and promotions
              strategy for Waterways Ireland, and several open seminars are
              planned to give interested parties and the public an opportunity
              to express their views.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted that the relevant
              Departments, North and South, are considering the updated
              feasibility study on the Ulster Canal to determine the way
              forward. A public meeting, organised by the Inland Waterways
              Association of Ireland and the Ulster Waterways Group to raise
              public awareness of the potential for restoring the Ulster Canal,
              took place in Monaghan on 12 March 2002 and was attended by more
              than 200 people. Those attending indicated widespread support for
              the project.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted the progress made on the
              procurement of permanent office accommodation for Waterways
              Ireland’s headquarters in Enniskillen. Detailed proposals from
              developers for three separate waterside locations at Ardhowen,
              Sligo Road and The Brook were subjected to technical and economic
              appraisal, and it is hoped that the outcome will be announced
              shortly. Sites have also been identified for new office
              accommodation for the regional offices in Scarriff and Carrick-on-Shannon.
              The Dublin office has been established at refurbished premises at
              Ashtowngate on the Navan Road, and staff transferred there
              recently.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Martin updated the Council on the current
              position on the recruitment of staff to Waterways Ireland. To
              date, 236 staff have been transferred to Waterways Ireland from
              former departments, which include the Rivers Agency in Northern
              Ireland. Following open competition, four directors have been
              appointed for operations, finance and personnel, technical
              services and marketing and communications, and six other heads of
              functions have been recruited. Competitions are in progress for
              other administrative staff, and a number of professional and
              technical posts have been advertised. The Council was pleased by
              the amount of interest in the positions advertised — almost
              1,500 applications were received for 47 administrative posts.
              However, it was appreciated that that created a lot of work for
              staff in Waterways Ireland who have to process the applications.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council approved Waterways Ireland’s
              draft corporate and business plan for 2002-04, which sets out a
              comprehensive programme of work on a wide range of policy issues,
              systems development and the proposed works programme. In terms of
              organisational development, Waterways Ireland plans to set up a
              policy steering group, a communications unit and a steering group
              to implement its new targeting social need action plan. An
              internal audit section will also be established. The corporate
              plan includes proposals to review health and safety policies and
              procedures, an assessment of charging policies and a review of
              navigation by-laws for the waterways within Waterways Ireland’s
              remit.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council approved Waterways Ireland’s
              equality scheme for formal submission to the Equality Commission,
              and its New TSN action plan was also approved. The Council noted
              Waterways Ireland’s annual statement of accounts for 2000, which
              was examined and certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General
              for Northern Ireland and the Irish Comptroller and Auditor
              General. Those accounts will be published together with Waterways
              Ireland’s annual report for 2000. The Council agreed to meet
              again in autumn 2002.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
              Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr J Kelly):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
              welcome the Minister’s updating us on the work of the
              North/South Ministerial Council on this important issue. I am glad
              to know that progress has been made in several areas. However, it
              has been more than a year since the Minister advised the House
              that the updated feasibility study on the Ulster Canal was being
              considered by the relevant Departments in both jurisdictions.
              Given the level of public interest in that, can the Minister
              indicate the extent of the progress made?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The feasibility study has been completed. In
              2000 it was estimated that it would cost £89 million to restore
              the Ulster Canal, and that is before taking into account any work
              to protect the environment and heritage aspects of the canal’s
              course. The environmental impact statement will be made once we
              have made the decision to proceed, which we have not done as yet.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our first task was the feasibility study, which
              showed a negative economic benefit, in so far as our Department of
              Finance and Personnel can test such a project. There are wider
              implications and wider social and economic benefits, which will
              all have to be considered. It is a large project, and it is
              actively being considered. However, I cannot say when I will be
              making the decision about this.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Wilson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No specific mention is made in the report of
              any progress that Waterways Ireland has made on zoning designated
              areas for different user groups on Northern Ireland’s larger
              expanses of water, such as Lough Erne and Lough Neagh. I saw quite
              a horrific thing happen during the summer. Young children, babies
              and their parents were bathing in an area that was clearly
              identified for bathing only. Jet skis were roaring among them at
              great speed, turning and twirling around and creating such
              dangerous water movement that a local person had to restrain a
              jet-skier.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are genuine user groups. I am not coming
              down on jet-skiers. There is a place for everyone — for
              cruising, for anglers, for commercial anglers and for water
              sports. However, they are all coming together. There is potential
              for a horrific accident. I hope that it does not happen. I hope
              that Waterways Ireland is tackling the problem. What progress has
              it made?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to zoning and navigational controls
              at Lough Erne, for example, there is clearly a need to upgrade the
              by-laws. Waterways Ireland is actively considering that and has
              discussed the matter with the chief executive of Fermanagh
              District Council. There has also been discussion with the various
              district councils along the navigational line of the Lower Bann.
              There is voluntary zoning on the Lower Bann, which appears to work
              reasonably well. However, no by-laws are in place. Waterways
              Ireland is aware that the matter needs to be dealt with and is
              seeking to do that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Waterways Ireland’s approach is to try to
              accommodate all responsible user groups. Mr Wilson gave the
              example of a dangerous situation in which bathers were in water
              among jet-skiers. That must be dealt with. Perhaps voluntary
              zoning is not always appropriate. That is why the by-laws for
              Lough Erne are being examined. There are no by-laws for the Lower
              Bann, but their introduction is being considered. That will
              require widespread consultation.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland’s contribution to the
              Waterways Ireland budget is just under £4 million, whereas the
              Republic of Ireland’s contribution is about £20 million. Can
              the Minister tell the Assembly how that ratio was arrived at?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The authority on the northern side of the
              border pays 100% of capital costs in Northern Ireland, but nothing
              towards capital costs in the Irish Republic, and vice versa. By
              agreement, the Irish Republic pays 85% of non-capital costs, and
              Northern Ireland pays 15%.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department is discussing the provision of
              headquarters accommodation with its counterparts across the
              border. After a suitable breakdown of, for example, the offices at
              Scarriff, Carrick-on-Shannon and Enniskillen, it has been accepted
              that it is inappropriate for Northern Ireland to pay 100% of
              headquarters capital costs at Enniskillen; nor is it appropriate
              for the Irish Republic to pay 100% of capital costs for the
              offices at Scarriff and Carrick-on-Shannon, which are regional
              offices that have common usage. The agreement is, therefore, that,
              with the exception of office accommodation, Northern Ireland pays
              15% of non-capital costs and 100% of capital costs on its side of
              the border.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
              </i><b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over 200 people attended a meeting in Monaghan
              on 12 March. Can the Minister confirm that some of those were
              involved in tourism? It would be interesting to know that, because
              if people involved in tourism do not attend such meetings, they
              should. There is a tourism potential to be realised.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, 236 staff have been transferred to
              Waterways Ireland. Many of us feel that that is an excessive
              number. Can the Minister confirm the full remit, responsibility
              and workload that Waterways Ireland is tasked to do? Can he also
              confirm whether 236 staff will be the final number, or whether
              more staff will be employed?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as the meeting in Monaghan and tourism
              representatives are concerned, water-based tourism is very much
              part of the thrust of Waterways Ireland. Water-based tourism is
              also very much part of the raison d’être for replenishing old
              canals that have fallen out of use, and, as I have said many times
              in the House, it has demonstrated large economic benefits in the
              Irish Republic, on the mainland and in Europe, where that activity
              is popular among tourists. Therefore, tourism plays a key role.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Waterways Ireland has set up a section
              specifically for marketing and communications, under a director
              who is looking to sell the product at all times. Indeed, through
              recent consultation between the two tourist boards and the various
              providers, a booklet called ‘Ireland’s Welcoming Waterways’,
              was produced. That is a preliminary project as they begin to sell
              the product. Tourism is very much a part of the picture as far as
              Waterways Ireland is concerned.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The anticipated complement of staff is 380; it
              currently stands at 300. For example, there are currently 50 staff
              in Enniskillen, with an anticipated complement of 70, which is the
              number of staff required. As far as the remit is concerned, I
              refer Mr Shannon to the corporate plan, the action plan and the
              various background documents to Waterways Ireland. However, it is
              essentially a navigation authority concerned with taking over
              navigable waters within the island and managing them for users,
              tourists and the local population.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although replenishing canals in the Irish
              Republic is very advanced, virtually nothing has been done in
              Northern Ireland. Much of the work lies ahead, and I anticipate
              that much of it will be done in Northern Ireland, not least on the
              Lagan Navigation and the Ulster Canal.</p>

              excluded from either the upper or lower parts of Lough Erne or
              confined to areas where it is uneconomical for users to travel.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that the Council noted
              progress on procurement of permanent office accommodation for
              Waterways Irelands headquarters in Enniskillen. What progress has
              been made? I would have expected a decision much sooner than now.
              Has real progress been made to allow a decision to be announced
              shortly, or is some sort of foot-dragging taking place on either
              side of the border?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The process of providing offices in Enniskillen
              has been ongoing for a couple of years. A development brief for
              the premises, in which there was a great deal of interest, was
              issued. A robust process was required to ensure that the decision
              was the best possible one for the taxpayer and for Waterways
              Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We honed it down to three possible sites:
              Ardhowen, Sligo Road and The Brook. We are now at the next stage
              — a site has been chosen, and an economic appraisal has been
              completed. I am satisfied that the process has been robust. The
              selection has been completed, and we are clarifying the legal
              position. I will make an announcement when budgetary
              considerations can be addressed. I have to be certain that we are
              ready to spend the money when I make the announcement, and I
              anticipate being in a position to do that in the near future. It
              would be premature to make an announcement today. The process is
              completed, but we must be certain that we have the correct answer.
              We are now ensuring that that is the case.</p>

              report and on the steady and sensible progress that has been made
              on this. I am interested in the potential of inland waterways to
              attract tourists. The report says that consultants are preparing a
              marketing and promotion strategy for Waterways Ireland. When will
              those reports be ready for publication and discussion by the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is difficult to give a precise date by which
              the reports will be ready. A marketing and communication system
              has been set up within Waterways Ireland under the control of a
              director, who is specifically tasked with selling the product as a
              tourist attraction, and he is working closely with both tourist
              boards. The first brochure, ‘Ireland’s Welcoming Waterways’,
              has already been published. That is the beginning of the process,
              but I am not sure when it will be completed. I can find out and
              write to the Member with details of the precise date for
              publication. There has been great interest in this, not least from
              the providers of the cruising craft and so on and from the local
              authorities around Lough Erne, the Lower Bann, and the canals in
              the Irish Republic. We consider the matter to be important and
              urgent and have given it priority.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that the feasibility study on
              the Ulster Canal is being considered by the relevant Departments
              to determine the way forward. Is serious consideration now being
              given to a reconstruction project for the Ulster Canal and, if so,
              is there a vague timetable for its delivery?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I attempted to relay the position on the Ulster
              Canal in an answer to a question asked by Mr John Kelly. The
              matter is being considered, and a feasibility study has been
              completed. We know the cost of the project, based on prices in
              2000. We will have to find inventive ways to fund such a large
              capital project. The Ulster Canal and Lagan Navigation capital
              projects should proceed, resources allowing. It is not simply a
              matter of making a case in the Assembly and then receiving the
              money in a cheque from the centre. That would not be possible. We
              must look at other sources, such as public-private partnerships
              and possibly the reinvestment and reform initiative.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those matters are being considered, and we take
              one step at a time. Old feasibility studies on the Ulster Canal
              have been examined, and environmental scoping has been brought up
              to date. The last scoping was carried out in 1998. I have been
              trying for the last couple of years to get close to a position of
              being able to make a proposal on the Ulster Canal, and we are
              coming to that point. Members will appreciate that it is a very
              large project and that we must step carefully.</p>

              welcome it, especially given the employment of 50 people in
              Enniskillen, which is an unemployment black spot in my
              constituency. I welcome the upgrading of mooring facilities on
              Lough Erne, which are needed by tourists and boat owners.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his comprehensive works programme, will the
              Minister include an audit of the water quality of the Erne system?
              I am concerned that there has been a visible growth in weeds along
              the supposedly navigable and deeper waters. Is the increased
              growth of eel weed in clear water due to the infestation of zebra
              mussels? The Republic of Ireland’s report on the water quality
              in its rivers shows that the headwaters of the Erne are the second
              most-polluted system in the Republic. Does the Minister have that
              report to hand?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although water quality is very important,
              Waterways Ireland has no responsibility for monitoring or policing
              water quality. That lies with another Department.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Zebra mussels were spread by boats and became
              widely established in the 1990s. No biological control for them
              has yet been identified. With regard to such matters as the Ulster
              Canal, that factor must be taken into account to ensure that the
              mussels are not carried further into our system.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In respect of Mrs Carson’s other concerns, I
              am not clear about the water quality of the headwaters in the
              Irish Republic. I can make enquiries if she wishes, but, strictly
              speaking, Waterways Ireland is an authority responsible for
              keeping waterways navigable, and water quality issues are outside
              its remit.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That the Second Stage of the Social Security
              Bill (NIA 3/02) be agreed.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Bill makes provisions for Northern Ireland
              which correspond to the social security provisions made for Great
              Britain by the Employment Act 2002, which received Royal Assent on
              8 July 2002. The Bill is, therefore, a parity measure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In yesterday’s debate on accelerated passage
              for the Bill, I mentioned that there has always been parity
              between Great Britain and Northern Ireland in the area of social
              security. That is as it should be. People in Northern Ireland pay
              the same taxes and National Insurance contributions as people in
              Great Britain. They are, therefore, entitled to receive the same
              benefits. In addition, parity enables Northern Ireland to use the
              Great Britain computer systems. That is much more cost-effective
              than having to set up separate computer systems here, which would
              have to be funded from the Northern Ireland block.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parity does not only cover the content of the
              legislation; it also covers the timing of its implementation. New
              provisions have always been introduced in Northern Ireland at the
              same time as they have been introduced in the rest of the United
              Kingdom, and that arrangement should continue.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clauses 1 to 4 of the Bill cover statutory
              maternity pay and maternity allowance. The period for which
              statutory maternity pay and maternity allowance are payable is
              being extended from 18 to 26 weeks, and the standard rate is being
              increased from £75 to £100 a week, or to 90% of weekly earnings
              where they are less than £100 a week.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are significant changes for working
              mothers. The increase in maternity benefits to £100 a week from
              April 2003 is the biggest in real terms since 1948. It comes on
              top of a substantial increase in April 2002 from £62·20 to £75
              a week. Combined with the extension to the payment period, the new
              rate of pay means that compared with now, most women who receive
              statutory maternity pay will gain about £1,250.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 3 introduces two important changes: it
              safeguards a woman’s entitlement to statutory maternity pay from
              15 weeks before her baby is due and increases the period of notice
              that a woman must give to her employer from three to four weeks
              before starting her paid leave. If a woman decides to leave her
              employer in the 15 weeks before her baby is due, for a reason
              unconnected with her pregnancy, she may not receive statutory
              maternity pay. Clause 3 introduces changes that ensure that if an
              employee meets the conditions for statutory maternity pay and
              notifies her employer properly, she will receive maternity pay,
              even if, for any reason, her employment ends after that point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Employees must provide three weeks’ notice
              before starting paid maternity leave. The period of notice has
              been extended to four weeks, which will give employers a longer
              period over which they can arrange cover for the absence of the
              pregnant employee. As now, clause 3 also provides a power to
              modify the entitlement in notice provisions in certain cases, such
              as premature birth.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 4 increases the standard rate of
              maternity allowance so that it mirrors the new standard rate of
              statutory maternity pay. A woman will receive the standard rate of
              £100 a week, or 90% of her average weekly earnings if that is
              less than the standard rate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most pregnant working women receive statutory
              maternity pay from their employers, but maternity allowance is
              aimed at those employees, such as self-employed women, women with
              a more variable employment record, and women who are on low
              earnings, who cannot receive such pay. Working women have no
              choice but to take time off work to prepare for and recover from
              childbirth, and it is important that we help as many as we can
              during that time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Welfare Reform and Pensions (Northern
              Ireland) Order 1999 introduced the requirement for certain benefit
              claimants to attend work-focused interviews. Clause 5 of the Bill
              extends that requirement to the partners of recipients of social
              security benefits that include an amount for the partner. Benefit
              sanctions may be applied if the partner fails, without good cause,
              to take part in an interview. The work-focused interview will
              concentrate on job potential and provide the partner with access
              to help and information on work benefits and services such as
              childcare. However, any action that a partner may choose to take,
              beyond taking part in the interview, will be entirely voluntary.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 6 makes further provision for the
              exchange of information between my Department, the Department for
              Employment and Learning, the Department for Work and Pensions and
              the Housing Executive. In particular, it allows for the exchange
              of employment and training information.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 7 of the Bill amends article 17 of the
              Deregulation and Contracting Out (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.
              The substitution of paragraph (4) arises from the need to make the
              proposed carers Order, which will address the deregulation of
              carers’ allowances, correspond with an equivalent Order made in
              Great Britain under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. Drafting of
              the carers Order highlighted a technical problem relating to the
              Assembly control of Orders made under article 17, and legal advice
              is that Assembly control cannot commence until paragraph (4) is
              amended.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The carers Order is significant because it will
              make several changes to invalid care allowance, including changing
              its name to carers’ allowance in April 2003. The Order will
              provide for carers aged 65 and over to claim the allowance for the
              first time and will extend the entitlement period for up to eight
              weeks after the death of the disabled person. In keeping with the
              long-standing principle of parity in social security matters, the
              provisions are required to be in place by 28 October so that
              claimants in Northern Ireland are not disadvantaged, particularly
              as the same provisions will apply in the rest of the country from
              that date.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The opportunity has also been taken to make
              consequential amendments to article 17(1) and 17(2) of the
              Deregulating and Contracting Out (Northern Ireland) Order 1996, to
              take account of the enactment of the Regulatory Reform Act 2001,
              the Social Security Fraud Act 2001 and the Child Support, Pensions
              and Social Security Act 2000.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 8 and schedules 1 and 2 of the Bill make
              minor and consequential amendments and repeals that flow from the
              changes being made by clauses 1 to 6.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill is an important step in the ongoing
              process of welfare reform, and I commend it to the Assembly.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Nelis:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
              welcome those clauses of the Bill that facilitate an improvement
              in the provision of statutory maternity pay and maternity
              allowance by increasing the period of payment from 18 weeks to 26
              weeks and by increasing the rate of maternity allowance. As the
              Minister stated, those provisions are contained in clauses 1 to 4
              of the Bill. That will be good news for expectant working mothers
              and fathers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the subsequent clauses, which the
              Minister has outlined, are more contentious — the potential
              impact of the Bill on partners could be described as the good news
              coming before the bad. The later clauses propose to change the
              Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 so as
              to make provision for work-focused interviews for partners of
              benefit claimants by inserting a new section after section 2A
              entitled:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Full entitlement to certain benefits
              conditional on work-focused interview for partners&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The partners of claimants who receive income
              support, jobseeker’s allowance, severe disablement allowance and
              invalid care allowance will be subject to that condition. Previous
              legislation, such as the Welfare Reform and Pensions (Northern
              Ireland) Order 1999, introduced a requirement for certain benefit
              claimants, including lone parents, to attend work-focused
              interviews. The provisions in this Bill propose to extend that
              requirement to partners of benefit claimants. If they fail to do
              so, the legislation will prescribe benefit sanctions. One can
              argue that there may be an advantage in encouraging partners who
              lack confidence or who believe that their role is to stay at home
              as the home keeper. Women in particular might derive some stimulus
              from work-focused interviews especially if the latter, according
              to the explanatory and financial memorandum, cover</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;previous employment records, capacity to
              undertake work, the in-house financial support available and help
              in areas such as childcare, housing and training.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, partners of claimants may
              feel that the requirements will eventually be enforced, and that
              is why they may see the Bill as contentious. They may be seeking
              work or taking up training even when they have family or other
              domestic responsibilities: there is also concern about the
              difficulties for claimants whose partners are claiming severe
              disablement allowance. The Bill does not recognise that many
              partners of claimants who stay at home are work-focused: work in
              the home requires many skills.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other concern about these provisions is the
              impact that they may have on carers of children, the elderly or
              the sick. It needs to be made clear that such people will not be
              penalised by the provisions and that work-focused interviews will
              not be extended by subsequent legislation to include compulsory
              attendance at training or compulsory job seeking. The major
              difficulty for the Committee for Social Development is that the
              requirement for legislative parity means that once again there is
              insufficient time to fulfil a proper scrutiny role adequately.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are not given sight of the passage of such
              Bills through Westminster. Are we expected to rubber-stamp those
              Bills which are given accelerated passage, without proper
              consultation or scrutiny? The Committee for Social Development and
              the Assembly deserve better. If we are to legislate on parity
              Bills, we should at least be given sight of the debate and
              amendments to such Bills, as they travel through Westminster.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are not &quot;as British as Finchley&quot;,
              and our constituents have different needs. Our social situation is
              widely diverse, with higher levels of unemployment and deprivation
              and more people on income support — 68% more than in England. We
              have a low-wage economy and serious health problems. It is time
              that the issue of parity in relation to social security matters,
              child support, pensions and all those needs are investigated in
              legal and in policy terms.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I get a sense from what some Members have said
              that there is a lack of clarity about parity. There is no such
              legal thing as &quot;parity legislation&quot; – it merely
              describes a political decision to keep legislation here the same
              as in the rest of the United Kingdom. The term &quot;parity
              legislation&quot; has no legal standing whatever. There is no
              description or definition of it — it is purely a political
              decision. The Assembly is at liberty to take whatever course of
              action it chooses in relation to parity. The Minister made that
              clear when he pointed out that there were certain economic and
              political reasons why he supported that stance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wanted to make that clear, because when the
              term is used there is sometimes an impression that it has a legal
              standing and that the Assembly is not free to make its own
              decision in that regard. From a procedural point of view I point
              out that the Assembly can do more than it might imagine.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge that the Minister has taken the
              time to ensure that the Committee for Social Development has been
              fully briefed on the legislation, in view of the fact that his
              Department would be asking for accelerated passage for the Social
              Security Bill to ensure that the principle of parity was adhered
              to, as the Chairman, Mr Cobain, outlined yesterday. Two weeks ago,
              the Committee reached the conclusion that the measures being
              proposed would be of benefit to many more applicants than was
              previously the case.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I therefore welcome the Second Stage of the
              Social Security Bill, which will, once fully implemented, provide
              benefits to some of the most needy and vulnerable in our society.
              In particular, I want to emphasise and, indeed, to welcome the
              changes made to maternity payments, which now include the
              provision for statutory maternity pay in relation to rate, period
              and entitlement. That is a major step forward in providing real
              and tangible assistance and benefits to working mothers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The changes made in the invalid care allowance,
              including the change of its name to carers allowance, widens the
              scope of those who are eligible to claim, by allowing people over
              the age of 65 to benefit from the scheme. Once the Bill is
              implemented in full, more people than ever before will become
              eligible for this type of benefit.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inclusion of the state pension credit Bill
              will ultimately benefit the most vulnerable and needy pensioners
              in our society. The Bill’s aim is to create a system that is
              easier to access and will therefore encourage pensioners to make a
              claim to which they are entitled. Once implemented, the changes
              will bring Northern Ireland into line with Great Britain and will
              allow pensioners in Northern Ireland to have access to the new
              state pension credit and thus a more generous income. This
              provides the opportunity for bringing more people into the realm
              of eligibility with regard to receiving benefits. With the passage
              of this Bill through the Assembly, the people of Northern Ireland
              will not lose out on any benefits to which they may be eligible.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the way in which the Bill has been
              handled over the past two days. I listened to Members’ points,
              and I wish to address a couple of those. The introduction of these
              benefits at the same time and at the same rates as in the rest of
              the country is good news for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, you made several comments about
              parity legislation, and you are right to point out that it makes
              sense to maintain parity for several political and economic
              reasons. There is now some statutory relevance and provision on
              this issue. Before 1998, there was no statutory basis for the
              application of the principle of parity. Section 87 of the Northern
              Ireland Act 1998 gave legislative expression to aspects of that
              principle for the first time. It requires the Secretary of State
              for Work and Pensions and the Northern Ireland Minister to run
              single systems of social security, child support and pensions to
              the extent agreed between them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must be emphasised that parity has worked to
              the benefit of the people of Northern Ireland for many years. It
              means that people here who pay the same rates of income tax,
              National Insurance contributions and so on are entitled to the
              same benefits, at the same rates, at the same time as people
              elsewhere. That is right, and if it were not the case, our
              constituents would rightly accuse us of depriving them of
              something to which they are entitled.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parity works to Northern Ireland’s advantage.
              For example, contributory benefits such as retirement pension and
              incapacity benefit are funded from National Insurance
              contributions. The amount raised through those contributions is,
              and has been for a long time, insufficient to meet the demand for
              such benefits, and the shortfall in the Northern Ireland National
              Insurance fund has to be made up by a transfer from the Great
              Britain fund. Non-contributory benefits are financed from taxation
              revenue. Expenditure is demand-led and is outside the managed
              block grant. If we interfere with that, we must bear in mind the
              consequences to the expenditure that will be required from the
              Northern Ireland block grant, and the expenditure that will be
              required to manage and implement any breach of parity with regard
              to computer systems and other matters. Anyone who examined that
              option in any detail would quickly see that it is to our benefit
              to continue to implement parity provisions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members raised several points about
              work-focused interviews. I must make it clear that this is simply
              the implementation of a principle for welfare reform. If a
              claimant has stated that they have a partner, that partner will be
              called to attend an interview. All that is required is that they
              discuss their personal circumstances. There is no requirement to
              find work. It is a means of exploring with the individual their
              needs and circumstances, and of giving them advice, support and
              help. It has been found to be very helpful. Not everyone will find
              work, but people can explore the opportunities for fulfilling
              their potential. That is all that is being asked of them, and that
              cannot be described as bad news. The Bill is good news for the
              people of Northern Ireland. It will bring benefits to those who
              are entitled to them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday I said that I was grateful for the
              opportunity to speak to the Committee for Social Development about
              the Bill, and to give our reasons for seeking accelerated passage.
              Some time ago officials appeared before the Committee to discuss
              the content of the proposed legislation, and members were provided
              with a copy of the draft Bill. I have searched the records, and
              there has been no correspondence from some Members who spoke today
              — I refer to one Member in particular — about any aspect of
              the Bill. People who speak about scrutiny and consultation should
              take this matter seriously. If Members have points to make, they
              should make them, and we could then discuss those points and deal
              with them as we go through the Bill, rather than Members making
              spurious points about consultation at the end of the process when
              they have not bothered at any stage to make those points directly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased with how the Bill has been
              debated. Mr ONeill made a useful point in yesterday’s debate,
              and I have made an undertaking with the Committee that officials
              will endeavour to keep members informed about the progress of
              legislation through Westminster. Members will be able to discuss
              issues and reflect on them, but they should remember that
              legislation may be changed at Westminster. It is sensible and
              correct that Members who are interested in issues should have the
              opportunity to be briefed. All Members can acquaint themselves
              with what is happening at Westminster. The information is in the
              public domain and is not a secret.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Assembly for its speedy and

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a historic piece of legislation because
              it is the first Committee Bill to be introduced to the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main purpose of the Assembly Ombudsman for
              Northern Ireland (Assembly Standards) Bill is to enable the
              Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland to fulfil the role and
              functions of an Assembly commissioner for standards. The Committee
              on Standards and Privileges is responsible for the consideration
              of any matter that relates to the conduct of Members, including
              complaints about alleged breaches of the Assembly’s code of
              conduct and the guide to the rules relating to the conduct of
              Members.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In September 2000 the Committee embarked on its
              first inquiry into the possible appointment of an Assembly
              commissioner for standards. The key recommendation in the
              Committee’s report was that there should be an independent
              mechanism for the investigation of complaints against Members, and
              accordingly that an Assembly commissioner for standards should be
              appointed. It was envisaged that the commissioner would
              investigate complaints against Members and submit a report to the
              Committee on Standards and Privileges on any investigation
              undertaken. In turn, the Committee would submit a report to the
              Assembly on all complaints investigated, and could recommend the
              imposition of sanctions on Members. The Assembly, in plenary
              sitting, would be the final arbiter on each complaint and on the
              determination of sanctions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly approved the report and its
              findings in April 2001.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After publication of its report, the Committee
              considered various methods of appointing a commissioner for
              standards and concluded that the Office of the Ombudsman for
              Northern Ireland was particularly well placed and equipped to
              discharge the functions of such a commissioner. The Committee was
              satisfied that the Ombudsman’s office had all the investigative
              infrastructure, skills and experience to investigate complaints
              against Members.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In taking this approach, the Committee was keen
              to maintain the independence of the commissioner by ensuring that
              neither the appointment nor the tenure of the commissioner would
              come within the authority of the Committee or of the Assembly
              itself. Our intention was that the independence of the
              commissioner for standards should be analogous to that of the
              Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The approach developed by the Committee was
              also based on a belief that the independent investigation of
              complaints by the Assembly Ombudsman, who is appointed through the
              public appointments procedure, would promote additional
              transparency in the investigative process and thus secure greater
              public confidence in the work of the Committee on Standards and
              Privileges and the Assembly itself. For reasons of economy,
              efficiency and effectiveness, the Committee decided that this was
              the most attractive option by far.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The investigation of complaints against Members
              will be in addition to the Assembly Ombudsman’s present
              functions of investigating complaints against Departments and
              other public authorities that are referred to him by Members.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In carrying out his function of investigating
              Assembly standards, the Assembly Ombudsman is not subject to the
              direction or control of the Assembly. However, where the complaint
              relates to a Member’s conduct, he must have regard to any code
              of conduct or guidance agreed or approved by the Assembly. To give
              effect to the proposals to have complaints investigated by the
              Ombudsman, the Committee concluded that primary legislation would
              have to be introduced and that the most appropriate method of
              advancing the relevant primary legislation would be by means of a
              Bill sponsored by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee went to consultation on its
              proposals through advertisement in the local press. No responses
              were received, and having to start its responsibility in this
              area, the Committee has taken the view that there appears to be no
              objection in principle to this approach. With that in mind, the
              Committee decided to proceed with the introduction of legislation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I stated at the outset, the Bill enables the
              Assembly Ombudsman to fulfil the roles and functions of an
              Assembly commissioner for standards. The primary function of the
              commissioner will be to carry out an investigation into matters
              relating to the conduct, interests and privileges of Members of
              the Northern Ireland Assembly at the request of the Committee and
              to submit a report on any investigation conducted. The
              commissioner will report to the Committee on his or her
              investigation but will not make any formal recommendation
              regarding the imposition of sanctions or penalties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee will subsequently report its
              findings on the complaint to the Assembly. The report will contain
              a recommendation on whether to impose sanctions on a Member. The
              full report, submitted by the commissioner to the Committee, will
              be appended to the Committee’s report to the Assembly. The
              Committee’s report may be the subject of debate in the Assembly,
              and the Member or Members complained about will have the
              opportunity to take part in that debate. The Assembly meeting in
              plenary, will ultimately decide whether to accept the Committee’s
              findings. The Assembly will also decide if any of the Committee’s
              recommendations on the imposition of sanctions on the Member
              should be accepted.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill is necessary to enable the Assembly
              Ombudsman to fulfil the role of Assembly commissioner for
              standards. For these reasons, I commend the Bill to the Assembly.</p>

              Education and Health, Social Services and Public Safety to
              instigate a comprehensive review of the services provided for
              people, adults and children, with Asperger’s syndrome and the
              training of professionals specialising in the treatment of such
              individuals.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this
              important, complex and difficult issue. Mr Speaker, as a layman I
              speak with trepidation, in the full and certain knowledge that you
              and other Members may know infinitely more about this topic than I
              do. Nonetheless, this motion is more about raising awareness and
              keeping the matter to the fore with the relevant Ministers. I
              appreciate the fact that the Minister of Health, Social Services
              and Public Safety is in the Chamber.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This matter is to do with fair play, equality
              and basic human and civil rights. There are people with Asperger’s
              syndrome and autism of different forms, and they may not be
              getting the support, care and attention that they deserve and are
              entitled to.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members have eyesight disorders, and they
              expect to get a speedy diagnosis of their problem, access to
              medical care and the glasses they need readily and easily. There
              is an induction loop system and other aids to support people with
              hearing difficulties who work in or visit this Building.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are people with Asperger’s syndrome
              whose needs are not visible and whose condition is not easy to
              diagnose, and when it is diagnosed it is not always clear what the
              best treatment is, so we must continuously update our knowledge of
              that syndrome, and of autistic spectrum disorder, and use best
              practice in treatment and education. We must ensure that the
              public have an understanding and awareness of the range of
              problems faced by those with Asperger’s syndrome and their
              families.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main characteristics of the syndrome are to
              do with how individuals communicate, understand the world around
              them and relate to their environment and to the people they live
              and come in contact with. Many people with Asperger’s syndrome
              are just like the rest of us; they want to make friends and
              interact, but they find it very difficult to communicate.
              Non-verbal expressions and social rules and conventions are quite
              often beyond them. That creates a high level of anxiety and
              isolation, difficulties with communication and severe learning
              difficulties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In those circumstances, their needs for care
              and attention, one-to-one education, and precision in the use of
              language and how one relates to the individual are much greater
              than ours. Therefore, we must find the mechanisms and supports
              that will allow sufferers of Asperger’s syndrome to live their
              lives and participate in society to the full. We must protect them
              against the almost inevitable danger that is depression, which
              looms somewhere in the back of their minds and is often one of the
              most debilitating symptoms of the disorder.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No professional medical practitioner would
              disagree that there are many differences in diagnostic procedures
              across the education and library board and the health board areas.
              There does not appear to be a single professional view of what is
              the most effective diagnostic method. Highly skilled professionals
              often must choose the type of treatments that should be given.
              Their decision is based more on personal experience than on any
              empirical research or proven methods. The situation is made more
              difficult by the fact that there is no defining biological marker
              or medical test on which to base a diagnosis. Furthermore, there
              is no co-ordinated or standardised approach to the making of
              assessments or diagnoses, or how treatment can best be delivered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The scale of the problem must be clarified.
              There is no accurate information about the numbers of
              schoolchildren or adults who have the disorder. Figures that I
              have obtained from the Southern Education and Library Board show
              that the number of people diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome or
              autism almost doubled between 1999 and 2001. In 1999, 126
              sufferers were diagnosed; that figure rose to 248 in 2001. Nobody
              in the Southern Education and Library Board or the health board
              was willing to stick his neck out and say that the figures were
              accurate. We do not know how many people have Asperger’s
              syndrome, either because they have not been diagnosed or because
              the problem is not discovered until the early teenage years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before we go much further, we must recognise
              that finding a mechanism for early diagnosis and intervention is
              crucial in helping sufferers from Asperger’s syndrome to live
              their lives to the full and in giving support to their families.
              We must have properly trained specialists from across the range of
              professionals in the education and health spheres who can
              recognise the potential of Asperger’s syndrome, and the language
              and learning skills that are needed. Those specialists can draw in
              key professionals such as members of education boards, social
              workers and specialist teachers, and can put together the type of
              multidisciplinary response that will allow sufferers of Asperger’s
              syndrome to live their lives to the full.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several organisations work with Asperger’s
              syndrome sufferers, and I am particularly grateful to Parents and
              Professionals &amp; Autism (PAPA) for its support and for the
              information it has provided me with.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report from the task group on autism, which
              was commissioned by the Department of Education, is well thought
              out and well researched, and much of what I am saying today
              reflects the contents of that report. However, structure and
              formality must be put on interdepartmental responses to autism and
              Asperger’s syndrome. Dedicated resources must be invested in the
              training of professionals and the delivery of supports to
              families. A common response should be developed by the Department
              of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the Department of
              Education, and also by the Department for Employment and Learning,
              because an autism-specific employment programme should be
              established to try to help sufferers of Asperger’s syndrome and
              other forms of autism to integrate into their environment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members wish to speak, and I appreciate
              the fact that the Minister of Education has arrived in the
              Chamber. I am grateful to the two Ministers for attending, and
              perhaps I will get an opportunity to make a winding-up speech at
              the end of the debate.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety (Dr Hendron):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to speak to this
              motion. The Committee for Health, Social Services and Public
              Safety is aware of the problems posed by Asperger’s syndrome.
              Representatives of concerned parents from PAPA and other
              organisations have spoken to the Committee about the difficulties
              faced by the parents of sufferers. They have spoken eloquently
              about the heartache parents face in trying to discover what is
              wrong with their children and of the lack of understanding of the
              condition among professionals and Health Service managers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful that the Minister of Education
              and the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety are
              present for the debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a GP with more than a few years’
              experience — I will not say how many — I know of the
              difficulty of identifying Asperger’s syndrome in young people
              and adults. The condition was only described in the 1940s, and
              health professionals are still unsure about the causes of the
              syndrome. It is an autistic syndrome disorder and it is a lifelong
              condition. Many people remain undiagnosed until they are adults.
              Only now are professionals becoming more familiar with Asperger’s
              syndrome and the real difficulties faced by people with the
              condition, especially children and young people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been estimated that 36 children in
              10,000 definitely have the syndrome and another 35 children in
              10,000 have similar social impairments. Many of those children may
              have above-average intelligence, but they face difficulties with
              social interaction, communication, understanding, and imaginative
              play. People with Asperger’s syndrome may suffer from severe
              depression, anxiety, impulsive behaviour and mood swings. Early
              diagnosis is therefore important.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Fee has rightly said that Asperger’s
              syndrome is a condition that requires a shared understanding and a
              shared approach from health and social care professionals and
              education professionals. The suitability of provisions in schools
              and at home for people with Asperger’s syndrome would be much
              improved if there were good links between health and education
              professionals. Health monitoring must be applied consistently to
              ensure that the disability is diagnosed early. Lack of early
              diagnosis will only increase problems such as lowered self-esteem
              and poor mental health.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The future lies in the hands of our children,
              and I ask the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public
              Safety and the Minister of Education to ensure that disorders such
              as autism and Asperger’s syndrome are properly resourced and
              funded. I welcome the Health Minister’s commitment, given to the
              Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, that she
              will introduce a review of mental health policy and improve
              adolescent mental health services. The Department of Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety and the Social Services
              Inspectorate will also undertake other work that may affect
              children with Asperger’s syndrome.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Examples of work to improve services, such as
              the new Southern Area Children’s Services Plan for 2002-05, are
              also welcome. The plan identifies the need for a coherent and
              integrated approach to family support to ensure that children
              reach their full potential. We need a coherent and comprehensive
              approach throughout Northern Ireland, irrespective of
              administrative boundaries, to sufferers of conditions such as
              Asperger’s syndrome. That must happen if we are to take
              seriously the Programme for Government, especially its focus on
              improving service delivery and addressing cross-cutting policy
              development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Chairperson of the Committee for Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety I ask the Minister of Health and
              the Minister of Education to instigate a co-ordinated review of
              the services provided for people with Asperger’s syndrome and
              related disorders. I support the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion wholeheartedly. Mr Fee
              clearly outlined the concerns and problems relating to Asperger’s
              syndrome that must be addressed. The Chairperson of the Committee
              for Health, Social Services and Public Safety also outlined the
              problems and what needs to be done. Parents and Professionals
              &amp; Autism (PAPA) has lobbied very hard on this distressing
              matter. The motion states that a comprehensive review must be
              instigated as soon as possible to deal with the issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parents are concerned by the perceived lack of
              understanding of Asperger’s syndrome among health professionals
              and others, which results in anxiety for parents and children. The
              Department of Education and the Department of Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety must recognise the problems surrounding
              the illness.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some parents discover that their children have
              the syndrome only when they start school. The syndrome can cause
              grave concern for parents and deep depression for children who are
              severely affected. A comprehensive review and the training of
              professionals to specialise in treating such individuals are
              vital. We must back that wholeheartedly, and I believe that all
              Members will do that. However, the Department of Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety must also focus on early intervention
              and treatment. I hope that both Departments will work collectively
              so that the anxiety of parents and children who are affected by
              the illness can be eased immediately.</p>

              support the motion. This is an opportunity to increase public
              recognition of Asperger’s syndrome and to focus on what needs to
              be done to address it. In 1999-2000, the Education and Training
              Inspectorate carried out a survey of children with Asperger’s
              syndrome. It found that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The area boards’ figures indicate that
              there are approximately 160 pupils who have been officially
              diagnosed as having Asperger syndrome.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The figures reveal wide variations between area
              boards and suggest variations in the diagnostic approach to the
              condition. The figures generally fall into the lower end of the
              nationally recognised ratios, which suggests that the condition is
              not widely recognised in the North.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inspection team’s view is that the
              present numbers appear to be significantly underestimated. The
              task of agreeing diagnostic criteria and applying them uniformly
              across the boards is urgent. Only when that has been done can the
              Department of Education evaluate the resources required to provide
              appropriate education for the children concerned.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to note that the Minister of
              Education and his Department have not been idle. The task forces
              on autism, both North and South, met and reported earlier this
              year. The report of the task force in the North noted that a wave
              of autistic spectrum disorder is rising through the school system
              and that, as it progresses, there will be large increases in the
              numbers of pupils, students and trainees diagnosed as having
              autistic spectrum disorder. There will also be a large increase in
              demand for appropriate services and educational provision.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report recommended that significant
              improvement be made in three areas: access to multi-agency,
              multidisciplinary diagnostic and assessment services; training for
              parents of, and people who work with, children and young people
              with autistic spectrum disorder; and school-based and home-based
              educational and therapeutic provision.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The treatment centre in Armagh will be a centre
              of excellence and an all-island facility. It will provide expert
              advice and access to the latest research. In order for the centre
              to be successful, it must harness the energies of all concerned,
              including health and education services, parents and academic and
              medical research, to deliver the best and most effective
              provision. The hopes of all the families of autistic spectrum
              disorder and Asperger’s syndrome sufferers are invested in it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recent developments suggest that we are on the
              right road, and we must continue down it to improve the situation.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank John Fee for bringing the issue before
              the House. Asperger’s syndrome is a form of autism that is often
              described as a display of odd behaviour. It affects sufferers’
              ability to communicate and the way in which they relate to others.
              As a result, they frequently cannot display appropriate social
              behaviour. They may be clumsy or awkward and have a lack of common
              sense. Many sufferers are dyslexic and have problems with
              mathematics, while others have language disabilities or sensory
              difficulties. They are often obsessive about routines, and, in
              order to avoid anxiety and stress, they need an extremely
              structured and supportive system with the minimum of change.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sufferers frequently feel isolated because they
              are aware that they are different from other people. Several
              Members said that increasing numbers of people are being diagnosed
              with Asperger’s syndrome. What information or education does the
              Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety provide
              about the condition for parents, carers or the wider community?
              Public awareness of the condition must be raised.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are the Minister of Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety and her Department communicating with the Minister
              of Education to ensure that teachers and healthcare professionals
              can be trained, so that skilled people are available to provide
              treatment and support for Asperger’s syndrome sufferers and
              their carers?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that this debate has come before the
              House proves the need for the Minister of Education to bring
              forward the special education needs and disability Bill as soon as
              possible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have identified a wide range of needs
              that are not being met, and the situation will deteriorate unless
              they are addressed immediately. I suppose that inadequate funding
              is the main reason for the lack of action. Although Asperger’s
              syndrome is pigeonholed under health, it is not only the
              responsibility of the Minister of Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety, but also of several other Departments, including
              Employment and Learning, and Social Development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A serious issue that affects people with
              Asperger’s syndrome is disability living allowance (DLA).
              Although DLA is aimed at improving the quality of life of those
              with disabilities, some people are wrongly denied it. Parents and
              carers of people with Asperger’s syndrome find it increasingly
              difficult to access DLA because of the guidelines in force. The
              right to choose is vital, so people with Asperger’s syndrome and
              their carers should have as many choices as possible. It is
              important that they be facilitated to take control of their lives
              and to achieve a level of independence commensurate with their
              condition.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also a social aspect. Every individual
              is part of the community and, as such, has the right to the
              opportunity to develop a social network. People with Asperger’s
              syndrome deserve those opportunities. I support the motion.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion; it is good that Mr Fee
              moved it. Although the Assembly has debated autism, this motion
              raises awareness of the difficulties experienced by people with
              Asperger’s syndrome, which is a growing problem. Members must
              send a clear message to the families who are directly affected by
              the dreadful and, at times, terrifying ordeal of having children
              or young people with Asperger’s syndrome or autism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the Assembly debate on autism we agreed
              that it was vital that all Departments co-ordinate their approach
              to autism and Asperger’s syndrome, which is an autistic spectrum
              disorder. We were delighted that the Department of Education, at
              the request of the Minister, set up a task group and a centre for
              autism sufferers. I am pleased that the Minister of Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety has had similar work carried out and
              that improvements will be made.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Autism and Asperger’s syndrome affect the
              families of sufferers, and it is essential that there be an urgent
              review, initially by the two Departments continuing the work that
              they have started, and then incorporating other Departments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been trying to convince the Minister of
              Education to ring-fence funds for special needs so that children,
              young people and adults can be given support and practical help
              appropriate to their situation. I hope that special-needs
              legislation will be introduced soon so that these changes can be
              made.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People with Asperger’s syndrome are usually
              highly intelligent but have many problems with social interaction
              and trouble with at least two of the following: a marked
              impairment in the use of multiple non-verbal behaviour, such as
              eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body posture and gestures to
              regulate social interaction; a failure to develop peer
              relationships appropriate to developmental level; a lack of
              spontaneous desire to share enjoyment, interests or achievements
              with other people, which is characterised by a failure to show,
              bring or point out objects of interest to other people; and, most
              importantly, a lack of social and emotional interaction.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am dealing with a child who suffers from
              Asperger’s syndrome, and the whole family of that child must
              deal with the situation hourly. Sufferers’ quality of life is
              impaired, so we should emphasise to the Executive that they should
              not be allowed to slip through the net of the system without help,
              treatment or support. Given the intelligence of those with the
              syndrome, it is often difficult to detect it during a child’s
              early years, and in the past children have been labelled as
              disruptive without any attention being paid to the causes of their
              behaviour. Research must be carried out to find out how best
              Asperger’s syndrome and autism can be detected early and
              specific treatment given.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therapy aimed at teaching social and pragmatic
              skills can remedy many weaknesses. Anxiety leading to significant
              rigidity can be treated medically. Although it is harder for them,
              adults with Asperger’s syndrome can have relationships,
              families, and happy and productive lives. Therefore the Assembly
              must stop the practice of passing such people from education to
              health; from having a learning disability to having a mental
              illness. Staff must be trained to deal with the problems
              adequately. The aim must be the development of a co-ordinated
              action plan and the provision of proper resources so that patients
              and their families can have a better chance in life.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
              welcome the motion, and the opportunity to speak briefly about
              Asperger’s syndrome and autism. I agree with Mr Fee who said
              that most Members probably know little about Asperger’s syndrome
              and autism. However, the Assembly can raise awareness: it has a
              duty to do so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am heartened by the attendance of the
              Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the
              Minister of Education: it sends out a clear message that they both
              take Asperger’s syndrome and autism seriously and that they are
              committed to providing appropriate services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some time ago, the Minister of Education
              announced to the Assembly the development and opening of a centre
              of excellence in Armagh. Mr McHugh said the centre would be an
              all-island facility that would provide expert advice, and the
              latest research, training, support and development for teachers
              and parents and for individuals who suffer from the disorder.
              However, it has been shown that in order for the centre to carry
              out that work, there needs to be commitment not only from Minister
              de Brún and Minister McGuinness but also from the Minister for
              Employment and Learning and from the Minister for Social
              Development. Ms Lewsley highlighted issues that are the
              responsibility of the Minister for Social Development and his
              Department such as disability living allowance. All such issues
              are interlinked.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most Members mentioned the task group, which
              made comprehensive recommendations with regard to
              interprofessional co-operation, the need to involve parents and
              the need to improve school and home-based education and therapy.
              Its report provides a road map for the Assembly’s approach to
              children and young adults who suffer from Asperger’s syndrome
              and other forms of autism. I welcome the task group’s report,
              which supports educational provision for children and young people
              with autism. I hope that the report’s main recommendations will
              be adopted as soon as possible. There have been several
              developments, such as the opening of the centre, that suggest to
              the Assembly that we are on the road to providing key services to
              people who suffer from the disorder. I suggest that a copy of the
              Official Report of this debate be passed to those Ministers who
              are not present, as the issue concerns them. I believe that the
              Assembly is on the right road and should continue down that road.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been drawn to my attention that we have
              a technical difficulty. I understand that the computers that run
              the annunciator service have frozen. I have seen quite a number of
              Members coming in during the debate, who may have had an interest
              in this subject and expected it to be a little later on. They may
              not have been assisted by the fact that the annunciators are
              frozen. Colleagues are working on this matter, but, obviously, it
              is not very helpful at this particular juncture.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second problem is that relatively few
              Members indicated a wish to speak at the start of this
              time-limited, one-hour debate. No less than two Ministers are
              present. They are referred to in the motion and will, therefore,
              wish to speak. I appeal to all Members to be as brief as possible.
              I will try to allow everyone to speak, but I may not be able to,
              simply because of the difficulties that have arisen. I ask Members
              to be as understanding as possible.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Robert Coulter:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise for not being present, owing to
              other responsibilities. I also apologise to Mr Fee for missing the
              beginning of the debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is fair to say that Asperger’s syndrome is
              not as well publicised as autism, so I congratulate Mr Fee for
              tabling the motion. I welcome the opportunity to debate the topic.
              It will, I hope, help to raise the condition’s profile with the
              public, statutory bodies and others who may come into contact with
              those who suffer from it. I have already told the House that I
              have a personal interest in autism, having a grandson who suffers
              from it, and I can identify hands-on with Asperger’s syndrome.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Experts will debate whether Asperger’s
              syndrome should be classified separately from autism. The task
              group on autism made it clear that there is a difficulty in
              differentiating between the two. There are two parts to that
              problem, namely those who suffer from the condition and the
              professionals who treat it. A division must be made between the
              two. For instance, care is taken of young people with autism up to
              the age of 19, but there is absolutely no provision after that.
              The problem with the professionals is that very little has been
              done to prepare for a diagnosis of the condition.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my meeting with PAPA, the problems in
              obtaining statistics about the number of people who suffer from
              Asperger’s syndrome were explained to me. The task group report
              argues that the lack of training for professionals in an organised
              assessment and diagnostic procedure makes it difficult to obtain
              data on those who have Asperger’s syndrome.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report speaks of an autism wave hitting
              services in Northern Ireland. Since 1999, the Southern Education
              and Library Board has recorded the number of children with
              Asperger’s. The data show that there has been a recorded
              increase of 158%. That could be due to several factors, including
              greater awareness. I was interested in a recent report on the BBC
              programme ‘Newsnight’, where it was stated that in California,
              3,000 new cases of autism are identified each year — a tenfold
              increase from the 1970s.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PAPA has made it clear that resources are not
              in place in the Department of Education or in the Department of
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety to deal adequately with
              the problem. The problem is not simply with Asperger’s syndrome,
              but with all autism conditions. Through the motion, I hope that
              the two Departments will take the problem seriously. I welcome
              what has already happened. Working together gives hope to those
              who suffer from this terrible condition.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise to Mr Fee for missing his
              contribution to the debate and congratulate him for bringing the
              motion to the Assembly Floor.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are 30,000 diagnosed Asperger’s
              sufferers in the UK. However, diagnosis is very subjective and is
              based on behavioural patterns rather than on any single test. Some
              Asperger’s sufferers are very successful — they often excel in
              academia — but are regarded as eccentric, clumsy or
              absent-minded. They do not like transitions and prefer routine.
              They fail to respond to non-verbal cues or body language and
              struggle to make relationships with their peers. Although there is
              no delay in language developmental milestones, people with
              Asperger’s syndrome may have a different way of using language.
              They tend to have a good vocabulary but do not appreciate the
              nuances of language.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They may have decreased social skills,
              including the avoidance of direct eye contact. Some sufferers can
              become very successful, with a tendency to immerse themselves in
              one subject. They often seem rude, but they simply have a
              different perspective on life and relationships. They become
              obsessed with complex topics in the fields of music, history or
              the weather, and they thrive on details that others would regard
              as obscure or irrelevant.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Their speech can be monotonous, repetitive and
              lacking in emotion and their conversations tend to revolve around
              themselves rather than anyone else. Many sufferers have dyslexia
              or have difficulty in writing. They can appear to have no common
              sense. In severe cases, sufferers can become depressed or
              aggressive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The condition was first described by Hans
              Asperger, a physician from Vienna, who in the 1940s noticed marked
              deficiencies in social and communication skills in several young
              boys with normal intelligence. The condition seemed slightly more
              common in males, with many children diagnosed between the ages of
              five and nine.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Treatments vary and no one therapy works for
              everyone. Ritalin has been tried by some sufferers, but its use is
              controversial. It is crucial that diagnosis is prompt and early
              and that it is followed, as quickly as possible, by intervention
              at home and in school. The number of children diagnosed will
              continue to rise rapidly, so the planning of future resources must
              allow for the existence of many more sufferers than we are aware
              of today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Training for parents and those working with
              children with autism spectrum disorders will become increasingly
              important. Society is ill-equipped to deal with the special
              educational needs of those children. A task group on autism set up
              in the Province produced its report earlier this year, after a
              comprehensive information-gathering process. I am not sure
              whether, by tabling the motion, Mr Fee wants to start a similar
              process. That would not be wise; I am not sure that anything new
              would be revealed. Although Asperger’s syndrome undoubtedly
              falls within the more able end of the autism spectrum, the key
              components in the management of all autistic children are the
              same. The task group report gives detailed guidelines on how to
              proceed. The difficult part will be the implementation of the
              recommendations, many of which are merely aspirational. The nuts
              and bolts needed to deliver those goals are crucial. All the best
              theories in the world are irrelevant until those with the
              condition and their families can recognise significant improvement
              in their daily lives. I support the motion.</p>

              functions with these conditions, which may involve partial
              disability. However, with other conditions there is evidence of
              normal pre-morbid development, for example, disintegrative

              sholáthraigh iontaobhais sláinte agus seirbhísí sóisialta gur
              diagnóisíodh 400 páiste agus 114 aosach le siondróm Asperger.

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Fee for providing the opportunity to
              discuss the needs of adults and children who have Asperger’s
              syndrome. Members raised several important concerns during the
              debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am committed to ensuring that children and
              adults with autistic spectrum disorders, including those with
              Asperger’s syndrome, have access to the necessary support and
              services. That includes co-operation between my Department and the
              Department of Education.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several diagnostic tests for autism can be
              useful in particular cases. However, the absence of a test which
              is reliable across the spectrum of autistic disorders has caused
              professionals to be cautious of introducing universal screening
              for autism in children. The effects of Asperger’s syndrome may
              become apparent only as children become older or in adulthood.
              Improving professional awareness of the condition results in
              earlier diagnosis of the syndrome, which can now be detected in a
              child’s early years. The latest figures from the health and
              social services trusts show that 400 children and 114 adults have
              been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome. A further 159 children
              await diagnosis.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Professional awareness helps to inform improved
              service provision; however, the pace of service development has
              been dictated by the availability of resources. Current service
              provision is typically met from learning disability and mental
              health programmes. Some £233 million was spent on those
              programmes in 2000-01. Although there are as yet no specific
              services for those with Asperger’s syndrome, health and social
              services boards report the development of generic services for
              people with autistic spectrum disorders. Examples include Down
              Lisburn Trust’s assessment and diagnostic team for autism, the
              establishment by Homefirst Trust of an autistic diagnostic team,
              autism diagnostic services at the Child Development Centre in
              Lurgan, and a specialist Asperger’s clinic run by the child and
              family psychiatric team.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Community-based child and adolescent mental
              health services have been developed in each trust in the Southern
              Board area, and a model of care for children with an autistic
              spectrum disorder has been developed in the Western Board area,
              through collaboration with the Western Education and Library
              Board, PAPA and the Foyle and Sperrin Lakeland Trusts. That is a
              start, but more work is necessary.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All trusts report that professional awareness
              is being addressed through training, and the Department is working
              with PAPA on the development of further training services.
              Professionals in community and specialist services provide support
              to parents. My Department funds projects run by PAPA, and I take
              this opportunity to pay tribute to PAPA’s work. Officials from
              my Department are working with their counterparts, particularly on
              the implications of the task group report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this autism awareness year it is important
              to pay particular tribute to PAPA’s work in raising local
              awareness of autism in all its forms. The organisation has worked
              closely with health and social services in securing development
              and has been particularly successful in achieving the adoption of
              a special education programme, the treatment and education of
              autistic and related communication handicapped children (TEACCH),
              in several trust areas. At the same time, the organisation
              explores with healthcare professionals how awareness training
              might be improved.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion calls for a comprehensive review of
              services for people with Asperger’s syndrome. That work is being
              taken forward in the following ways. The report produced by the
              task group on the education of young people and children with
              autistic spectrum disorders, launched earlier this year by the
              Minister of Education, sets a comprehensive agenda for our two
              Departments to develop services and support for these children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Executive Colleague, Martin McGuinness, will
              say more about that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the centre of excellence, which is a
              significant development. I understand that detailed proposals for
              that project are being developed, and officials from my Department
              are involved in that work to ensure that the necessary healthcare
              support is provided.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the publication of the task group’s
              report, the Department asked the health and social services boards
              to assess its implications for health and personal social
              services, and to quantify the additional resources likely to be
              needed to develop relevant services. That work is nearing
              completion and mirrors work undertaken by the education and
              library boards. There is no doubt that a multi-agency and
              multi-professional approach is required to meet the holistic needs
              of people with Asperger’s syndrome.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Significantly, the Department’s Social
              Services Inspectorate has commenced an inspection of services for
              children with disabilities. The inspection will cover children
              with all types of disability; it will include children who have
              been hospitalised for three consecutive months and those who live
              in the community. The inspection team’s report is due in spring
              2003.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Officials are in discussion with PAPA about the
              best way in which training for professionals should be
              implemented. Those discussions will also identify the financial
              support and any other support that the Department might be able to
              provide.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Children and adults with Asperger’s syndrome
              should be able to access the services and support required to meet
              their needs. Since I became the Minister of Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety, the development of child and
              adolescent psychiatric services, learning disability services and
              mental health services have been high on my priorities for action.
              Expertise among health and social services professionals in that
              field is developing, and a range of specialist services are being
              put in place to meet the identified needs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall continue to highlight the case for the
              necessary resources and to do all that I can, in conjunction with
              Executive Colleagues, to ensure that services are available as
              soon as possible.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Education (Mr M McGuinness): </b>I
              thank John Fee for highlighting the issue of services for children
              with Asperger’s syndrome and for providing Members with the
              opportunity to discuss recent developments. I was interested to
              hear several Members articulate<b> what Asperger’s syndrome and
              autism are. The best </b>example that I have witnessed was that of
              a 10-year-old boy<b> called Kenneth Hall, who visited me at the
              Assembly. He has written a book in which he explains how autism a</b>ffects
              him. I encourage all Members, and everyone who<b> is interested in
              special educational needs, to read that </b>book. It is a
              fascinating read; it has only around 100 pages <b>and could be
              read in two hours, yet it gives a fantastic insight of a child who
              is affected by the syndrome.</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Minister of Education, I have repeatedly
              made clear my commitment to special educational needs. I remain
              committed to the development of high-quality services for children
              with special needs, their families and their schools. I have
              placed a strong emphasis on interdepartmental working to effect
              improvements in that area, not only between my Department and the
              Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, but
              between health and education Departments throughout Ireland and
              through collaboration with the voluntary sector.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">John Fee, Paul Berry and Joe Hendron spoke
              about the need for a comprehensive review of the services that are
              available to people with Asperger’s syndrome. The Department is
              undertaking work on educational provision for children with
              Asperger’s syndrome in several ways. The task force on autism,
              which I launched earlier this year, has produced a comprehensive
              and hard-hitting report on the education of children and young
              people with autistic spectrum disorders. The report sets a
              challenge for those of us in the education and health sectors to
              work together to improve the diagnosis, assessment and educational
              provision for children with autism. The task force found that, in
              the past few years, education, health and social services
              provisions for children with autistic spectrum disorders have
              entered a period of rapid improvement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report made recommendations for significant
              improvement in three main areas: access to multi-agency and
              multi-disciplinary diagnostic and assessment services; training
              for parents of and people who work with children and young people
              with autism spectrum disorder (ASD); and school- and home-based
              educational and therapeutic provision.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department is planning a major conference,
              which will take place in a few weeks, for relevant education and
              health professionals who are involved in service planning and
              provision and for parents and representatives of voluntary
              organisations. That event will provide a focal point for
              discussion on how best to proceed with the recommendations of the
              tasks group’s report. Last year, my Department’s Education and
              Training Inspectorate published a survey of pupils with Asperger’s
              syndrome. Rev Robert Coulter mentioned that there is a perceived
              increase in levels of autism. In many ways we are satisfied that
              that increase can be explained by improved methods of detection. I
              have asked that the findings of that survey be considered in the
              light of the task group’s recommendations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As well as those local developments, my
              Department has actively engaged in cross-border work to help
              improve ASD provision. It is significant that my Department and
              the Department of Education and Science in Dublin are actively
              involved in the establishment of a centre of excellence for autism
              which will be located in Middletown, County Armagh. All of us who
              are interested in this field are excited about what can be done at
              that centre. Detailed plans for the operation of the centre are
              under development, and we are trying to get it up and running by
              the autumn of next year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The centre will provide diagnostic support and
              assessment services, training and advice for parents and teachers,
              an individual learning centre and ASD research and information
              services. Among other activities, my Department has worked with
              the voluntary organisation, PAPA, which has been mentioned several
              times in the debate and with which I met last week, to produce an
              information video for parents of children with autism as well as
              an awareness-raising digital versatile disc for teachers in
              mainstream schools who may be encountering autism for the first
              time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Robert Coulter also mentioned the
              interesting issue of what happens to children with special
              educational needs when they leave the education system after the
              age of 19. That affects children other than those with autism or
              Asperger’s syndrome, such as the many others who have special
              educational needs. I have been conscious of that, and the Minister
              of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the Minister for
              Employment and Learning and I met last week with our officials to
              tackle the matter head on. The three Departments have established
              a group of officials to deal with the difficulties outstanding.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am determined that the education and library
              boards be equipped to deal with the issue and to enable children
              in the autism spectrum, including those with Asperger’s
              syndrome, to access the educational provision that can best meet
              their educational needs. Special educational needs remain at the
              top of my agenda, and I will use my best endeavours to secure the
              resources that are necessary to develop those important issues.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to indicate my appreciation, not
              only of Members’ and Ministers’ general conciseness, but in
              particular of the proposer who volunteered to reduce his own
              comments to a few brief remarks so that all other Members who
              wished to speak could do so.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, Mr Speaker. I appreciate the fact
              that the two Ministers were here and gave such comprehensive
              commentary on what is going on. I should explain to Mrs I Robinson
              that the motion was originally tabled last October, but Members
              across the Chamber have accepted the spirit of the motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The thrust of the work of the two lead
              Departments, as well as the other Departments, must centre on
              three goals: early assessment, early diagnosis and early
              intervention. Everything must be subordinate to those goals. From
              what I have heard this morning, I am convinced that the two
              Ministers are heading in the right direction, and I appreciate
              that.</p>

              point, easy to agree and non-controversial. We made every effort
              to get cross-party support. What does the motion say? It says

              further afield into Larne, Derry and Antrim and to isolated
              families in all parts of the Six Counties. Sectarianism has been

              in Alliance Avenue, Newington Street or in the Parkside,
              Clandeboye or Serpentine areas is a living hell. There is a
              constant expectation of a stone, petrol bomb, bullet or bomb
              coming through a kitchen or bedroom window. Family homes have
              rooms which cannot be used — beds are abandoned and kids sleep
              on camp beds, sofas or chairs in sitting rooms. Back or front
              doors are never used: nerve tablets are overused.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sectarianism is the growing nervousness that
              never leaves: it is the alienating and isolating experience that
              is hard to comprehend, even if you live just a couple of streets
              away. It is living with buckets of sand and hosepipes and not
              redecorating the house because it is not worth it, and it is the
              deep anxiety every time your child or your spouse leaves the
              house.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What has made the problem stand out over the
              past few years is that it has been concentrated 24 hours a day on
              the same groups of ordinary families. I have been in their homes
              and know that others in the Assembly have been there also. The
              challenge often heard being offered to visitors or observers is to
              spend some nights living there: &quot;Come and live with me in
              these homes and see what it is like.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That challenge is not made by people who wish
              to be clever or smart alecs. It is made because of the frustration
              felt by the victims of sectarian attacks. No matter how they
              describe their lives, they feel that others must experience them
              to understand how bad the situation really is.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past two years, six people have been
              killed by Loyalist attacks — four were Catholics and two were
              Protestants who were unfortunately mistaken for Catholics. There
              have been hundreds of gun and bomb attacks and innumerable other
              sectarian attacks on people and property. There is documented
              evidence of more than 360 sectarian attacks in a single
              three-month period. In north Belfast, since the Loyalist
              Commission’s &quot;no first strike&quot; statement on 15 June,
              we have seen at least 25 gun attacks, 29 bomb attacks and more
              than 66 other attacks, including stabbings, petrol bomb attacks
              and massive damage to property in the Nationalist part of the
              community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Churches and schools have been far from immune,
              with the Holy Cross blockade serving as a dark monument to
              bigotry. Other Members, Unionist and Loyalist, can supply their
              own horrific lists. Although I can speak of the consequences and
              experience of anti-Catholic sectarian attacks only, I am not blind
              to the suffering of many Protestants over the various walls. The
              majority of sectarian attacks are against Catholics and
              Nationalists. However, the fact that Loyalists carry out the most
              significant proportion of attacks does not help Protestants who
              suffer from similar attacks. Therefore, we must make it crystal
              clear that we are against sectarianism, regardless of where it
              emanates from and whoever the victim may be.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate may turn into a dogfight. I hope
              that it does not, and it is certainly not the intention of the
              motion. People are suffering. They are watching this debate, and
              they want to know whether the Assembly can do anything to help
              them. A unified, anti-sectarian voice would go some way towards
              assisting them. Our parties are already meeting in a subgroup to
              try to find more practical ways to make progress. For example,
              agreeing a series of cross-community communications would be a
              practical step. Let us show our leadership today. Let the
              pro-agreement parties demonstrate their belief in dialogue as a
              process for resolution. We must lead by example on an issue that
              we can all support.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call on the Assembly to support the motion.

              commits itself to providing leadership on this issue in practical
              ways. This Assembly re-affirms its commitment to non-violence and
              exclusively peaceful and democratic means and calls upon all
              parties to actively support and co-operate with the Police Service
              of Northern Ireland in securing evidence against those involved in
              violence and in default of their ceasefires.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The UUP has tabled an amendment to Sinn Féin’s
              motion because that motion seems to mix pious aspiration with a
              complete abdication of responsibility on its part. Yes,
              sectarianism as it has developed in Northern Ireland is an evil.
              It is wrong that people’s views are warped by brutal prejudice.
              It is wrong that there is an inability to tolerate difference.
              Notice that I said &quot;difference&quot;, because it is
              inevitable that there are differences in a plural society. It is
              wrong that parts of this city, and indeed the Province, are cut up
              into a patchwork of zones, between which many fear to move.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Sinn Féin motion falls prey to a
              fallacy, which is that, in a sense, everyone is to blame, so that
              therefore no one in particular is to blame. The motion, from Sinn
              Féin’s point of view, does not face the uncomfortable truth
              that paramilitaries’ activities have often been major drivers of
              sectarian tension. Alas, such terrorist groups are still active,
              and, in many respects, the Loyalist groups are often as bad as,
              and sometimes worse than, Republican groups. The wording of our
              amendment tries to reflect that point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not an exponent of some notion of
              collective or communal guilt. However, in moving the amendment, I
              recognise that sometimes parts of Unionism — broadly defined —
              have not met its high ideals, and that they have had a nasty
              underbelly in their treatment of other sections of the population.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The UUP is certainly not soft on Loyalist
              paramilitarism. I do not distinguish between those terrorists who
              are considered to be &quot;our terrorists&quot; and, therefore, by
              implication, excusable, and other terrorists — &quot;their
              terrorists&quot; — who are deemed to be inexcusable. They are
              all simply wrong.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The record has been dismal, and, sadly, it is
              not yet a history on which the book has been definitively closed.
              Since 1969, as is well known, almost 3,700 lives have been lost.
              Of these, about 59% were the responsibility of Republican
              terrorist groups, and a further 28% died at the hands of
              Loyalists. There were up to 50,000 injuries, too. If one is to be
              seriously anti-sectarian then one must call for a halt to all
              paramilitary activity, and for this to be done in transparent and
              verifiable ways. For example, there must be an end to the exiling
              of unfortunate individuals from their homes in Northern Ireland.
              There must be an end to torture beatings — the so-called
              punishment beatings. The August 2001 report titled ‘They Shoot
              Children Don’t They’ by Prof Liam Kennedy says that during the
              three years 1998 to 2000 there were 636 Loyalist shootings and 496
              Republican ones — one fifth and one third of these victims,
              respectively, were under the age of 20.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Sinn Féin motion, which we are attempting
              to amend, concludes weakly by asking the Assembly to reaffirm its
              commitment to peaceful politics. That is all very well, but is an
              evasion of responsibility on its part. The Westminster Government
              have responsibility for applying adequate standards for the
              maintenance of the rule of law. In this regard, one might contrast
              and compare Prime Minister Blair’s pliable approach to that of
              his Spanish counterpart, Mr Aznar, who has recently banned the
              political apologists of the Basque terrorist grouping, ETA. As we
              saw last autumn, international public opinion — especially
              American — has a crucial role in the restraint of terrorism in
              this part of the world, as in other parts.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ultimately, Sinn Féin should recognise its own
              responsibility. Will it, as our amendment suggests, accept that
              the PSNI has a majority support in public opinion, and is the sole
              legitimate force to apply the rule of law? Finally, how does the
              motion, with its various pious exhortations, compare with the
              recent IRA apology? Will Sinn Fein now be in a position to condemn
              all deaths inflicted by paramilitaries since 1969, which would be
              a constructive step towards improving the climate for reducing
              sectarianism?</p>

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the outset it is interesting to note that
              neither of the Members who have spoken has made an attempt to
              define the word &quot;sectarianism&quot;, and it is here that we
              have to come to grips with the motion before the House today. The
              word &quot;sectarian&quot; comes from the word &quot;sect&quot;. I
              looked at the Catholic encyclopedia to find out what it had to say
              officially, as a Church, about this matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To the Catholic the distinction between Church
              and sect presents no difficulty. For him, any Christian
              denomination that has set itself up independently of his own
              Church is a sect. According to Catholic teaching, any Christians
              who banded together and refused to accept the entire doctrine, or
              acknowledge the supreme authority, of the Catholic Church
              constitute merely a religious party under human, unauthorised
              leadership. The Catholic Church alone is that universal society,
              instituted by Jesus Christ, which has a rightful claim to the
              allegiance of all men. It is the sole custodian of the complete
              teaching of Jesus Christ, which must be accepted in its entirety
              by all mankind. Its members do not constitute a sect, nor will
              they consent to be known as such. The word &quot;sectarian&quot;
              was coined in Reformation times to label those opposed to the
              claims of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I was being brought up in the Province,
              Nationalist politicians labelled everything that was Protestant as
              sectarian. The Orange Institution, Protestant churches, the
              police, the old House of Commons here, and so on, were labelled as
              sectarian.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We see the hypocrisy of a party that represents
              those who have murdered and wrought mayhem through our Province;
              who, in their bloodlust, have slain men, women and children; and
              who have also laid their hands on their co-religionists because
              they associated in any way with Protestant people. Sinn Féin then
              tells us that this is a simple resolution. Of course it is —
              because in its interpretation, its members are not sectarian. I
              have heard them boast in the House that they are not sectarian. We
              are asked today to give them an excuse — to join with them in an
              absolutely meaningless resolution.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The word &quot;sectarian&quot; must be defined.
              I ran into one of the leading Protestant clergymen of the Province
              the other day. I did not have a confrontation with him; I met him
              in the British Airways lounge in London. I asked him why clergymen
              do not tell people what sectarianism is. He said, &quot;Ian, it is
              a very convenient word; we like it.&quot; We should not be dealing
              with conveniences in the House; we should be dealing with
              realities. It is a reality that this word, with which Nationalism
              and Republicanism has branded Protestantism for a long time and to
              this day, should be set in its proper context.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was struck recently by the contents of the
              report on children. I am sorry that the full report was not made
              available to us by our information services; part of it was
              omitted. However, it is interesting to note that when children
              were asked whether they liked the police, three-year-old Roman
              Catholic children were more than twice as likely to say that they
              hated the police as were Protestant children of that age. The
              seeds that IRA/Sinn Féin has sown are bearing fruit, as it has
              brought its people up to hate the police. Hence, there is no
              mention of the police or support for the police in the motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Official Unionist resolution is not strong
              enough; it should have been far stronger. We must affirm, not
              reaffirm. What is the use of calling people who say they have
              already affirmed this resolution? There has been no real
              affirmation that everyone in the Assembly is committed to
              non-violence and exclusively peaceful and democratic means. The
              acts of those who proposed the motion and lead the debate today
              give the lie to that very effectively.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need only to look at IRA/Sinn Féin’s
              record. It has been updating weapons and bomb techniques in
              Colombia; exchanging tips with its colleagues in the Revolutionary
              Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) movement; rearming from Russia and
              Florida; and targeting leading political, judicial, security,
              forensic and Loyalist figures using updated intelligence files. It
              has been identified as the major line of inquiry into the break-in
              at Special Branch headquarters in Castlereagh; has murdered dozens
              of individuals in Northern Ireland since the signing of the
              Belfast Agreement; and has been consistent in its role as judge
              and jury in the community to say who will be beaten, shot,
              murdered and intimidated. Recently, it has orchestrated terrible
              violence against the Belfast community. Let us throw out this
              hypocritical and treacherous motion.</p>

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will outline the SDLP’s two-phased approach
              to the motion and the amendments. First, if the political
              leadership of Northern Ireland is to demonstrate its political
              calibre, it should do more than simply talk; it should take
              practical steps to confront sectarianism, and it should begin to
              outline what those steps should be. The SDLP’s amendment is the
              only one that outlines a strategic approach to deal with
              sectarianism and to see that it is dealt a body blow.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the motion and the other amendments
              are, to a greater or lesser extent, partial or selective in the
              treatment of sectarianism. The Assembly should be holistic and
              inclusive in dealing with sectarianism. Whatever sectarianism is,
              we must pursue, prosecute, penalise and purge it from wherever it
              resides in society. We should not ignore or forget the fact that
              that includes the political parties and Members.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, where there is genuine alienation and
              dissent, and where people are genuinely distressed or in conflict
              with the state, we must interpret and understand that dissent and
              learn from it. That balanced approach, and a ruthless
              confrontation of sectarianism and an understanding of what is
              genuinely alienating in our communities, is the prescription to
              deal with the problem.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP proposes a three-pronged offensive
              against sectarianism, part of which has already been put in place
              at interfaces and through the political institutions. However, it
              must be upgraded and fast-forwarded.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first of those three dimensions is
              security, which requires that the PSNI provide adequate protection
              and vigorous prosecution of those involved in sectarian tensions
              and interface violence. It requires mechanisms at locations of
              tension and disorder so that people in the community, and those
              working in the institutions of the state who are trying to manage
              tensions, can deal with them better. It also requires mechanisms,
              probably put in place by third-party agencies, to ensure that,
              even though there is mistrust and differences at those interfaces,
              a third party can maintain communication between the communities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second dimension involves a community
              element, which would include putting mechanisms in place to manage
              interface and sectarian tensions better. It would also involve the
              creation of a community mechanism, whereby people can begin to
              process the issues that have given rise to their worst fears and
              which fuel sectarian tensions and interface violence. That is a
              medium-term structured approach to dealing with sectarianism and
              bad community relations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third dimension is the political element,
              and requires sustained dialogue not only between parties but also
              between parties and Government in order to understand what is
              happening on the ground and to begin to develop shared strategies
              for confronting sectarianism. In the longer term our understanding
              is upgraded, and economic, social and community strategies are put
              in place to ensure that all expressions of sectarianism are dealt
              a body blow.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is the three-pronged security, community and
              political strategy that in the immediate, medium and long term can
              begin to address the issue. However, we still have a long road to
              travel, and that is evident in some of the content of the motion
              and the amendments, which are selective and partial. That ill
              informs this debate and ill informs our community as it struggles
              with the excesses of sectarianism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why are the motion and the amendments partial?
              It is because, as we might have anticipated, Unionism sees
              sectarianism arising from features and factors in our society
              other than from the past nature of the state and the past conduct
              of agencies of the state. That has caused people to have worst
              fears rather than best hopes about elements within the state and
              has seen them experience bad practice and conduct at the hands of
              the state. If we do not acknowledge that, then we are not
              acknowledging all of the truth.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similarly, the Sinn Féin motion is partial
              because while it condemns intimidation, Sinn Féin refused to
              condemn the intimidation of PSNI trainees. It condemns threats and
              disorder, yet Sinn Féin members, in a council chamber in the
              North in the last 10 days, openly threatened SDLP people who are
              taking part in district policing partnerships. They asked if the
              people concerned had spoken to their families about what they were
              doing, whether they would be carrying firearms, whether they knew
              that posters of them would appear on lampposts all over Newry and
              if they knew who was going to pay for the damage caused to their
              houses while they sat on the district policing partnerships.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we had a normal society that was based on
              trust and tolerance, and in which we all worked together in good
              faith for the benefit of all, such a motion, even as tabled by
              Sinn Féin, could probably be passed unanimously without debate.
              Yet, four years after the Good Friday Agreement, we are using such
              a motion and three partial amendments to demonstrate the lack of
              trust that exists in the House and, thus, in the wider population.
              Today we are exposing the tribal divides that exist in Northern
              Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sectarianism is rife. The intolerance that goes
              with it is part of the daily diet throughout Northern Ireland.
              Hardly a day passes without some graphic reminder of some group or
              individual vomiting intolerance upon another. It is indisputable
              that this intolerance is primarily orchestrated by the bigotry of
              thugs and gangsters collectively referred to as paramilitary
              organisations from both Loyalist and Republican factions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Their quest to gain and maintain control of
              areas and people through terror is a scourge, which can be used to
              the potential gain of some who will constantly blame the other
              side and ignore the faults of their own. If all the elected
              representatives in the House were genuinely opposed to all
              violence and to the use or threat of force by others, I do not
              believe that we would be witnessing the level of intolerance that
              exists on our streets today. We are supposed to represent the
              community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at the statistics. In 1999-2000
              there were 131 shooting incidents. In 2001-02 there were 358. In
              1999-2000 there were 66 bombing incidents, and in 2001-02 there
              were 318. Each and every one of those incidents is an example of
              bigoted, tribal sectarianism that underpins intolerance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Four years ago, Members who supported the Good
              Friday Agreement reaffirmed their opposition to any use or threat
              of force by others. Is the political leadership in this House so
              weak that it has no impact upon the society that we are supposed
              to be leading — or is a blind eye being turned to violence for
              political reasons? Even worse, are some political parties happy to
              ride on the back of the terrorist monster and help to feed its
              insatiable appetite?</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not only security statistics that
              highlight bigoted sectarianism: our cities, towns, villages and
              estates provide colourful evidence of intolerance. There is the
              illegal painting of paths, kerbs and roadways with green, white
              and gold or red, white and blue. There are the illegal murals
              glorifying murderers on gable walls and depicting some murderous
              exploit by thugs — inviting the gullible to join illegal
              organisations. There are the slogans informing us that we are
              entering Loyalist or Republican estates; the scrawled messages
              that the police are not acceptable, and the flying of an
              assortment of flags from every possible post or pole. This is the
              overt evidence of intolerance and a warning to the &quot;other
              side&quot; that they are not welcome. The desecration of churches
              and graveyards and the burning of schools are further examples of
              sectarianism at its worst.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All so-called paramilitary organisations — be
              they the UDA, IRA, UFF, Continuity IRA, real-fat IRA or low-fat
              UDA — are by their nature and existence sectarian, bigoted and
              intolerant. They exist to instil terror and thus promote their
              bigoted and sectarian cause.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion refers to providing practical
              leadership on sectarianism. Let us start by supporting the PSNI.
              Policing cannot work effectively without the support of the entire
              community. If you are not part of the solution then you are part
              of the problem. Those who threaten the police or withhold their
              support from the police or who are seen to be anti-police are
              demonstrating bigotry in adherence to their political doctrine or
              intolerance: they are sectarian.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How can one claim to reject sectarianism while
              at the same time refuse to support a cross-community police
              service whose raison d’être is to provide effective, good
              policing throughout the community — the word
              &quot;hypocrisy&quot; springs to mind.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another example of political leadership would
              be to call for the immediate disbandment of all paramilitary
              organisations.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before I address the IRA/Sinn Féin motion I
              want to reiterate the NIUP’s rejection of paramilitary violence.
              The Republican movement and the so-called Loyalist terror groups
              are mirror images of each other with a common commitment to
              criminality, murder and barbarity. Despite those considerations,
              the NIUP also rejects the motion tabled by the members of IRA/Sinn
              Féin because it is shot through with gross moral hypocrisy. I say
              that for four reasons.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the motion is being tabled by members of
              IRA/Sinn Féin, an organisation that is a murder machine that has
              been responsible for the murder and injury of thousands of people
              over many decades. Secondly, the active membership of IRA/Sinn
              Féin is sustained by the driving force of a political
              sectarianism — a denigration and hatred of fellow citizens
              because of their religious and political commitments. That is what
              drives IRA/Sinn Féin. Despite that, the motion asks Members to
              express sympathy to all those who have been the victims of
              sectarian murder. It is difficult to conceive of a more blatant
              example of gross moral hypocrisy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, the motion is being tabled by members
              of an organisation whose leader is an unqualified apologist for
              IRA murder. In the ‘Politics of Irish Freedom’ Gerry Adams
              states without the slightest indication of moral scruple:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The tactic of armed struggle&quot;,</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">that is, IRA/Sinn Féin terrorism,</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;is of primary importance because it
              provides a vital cutting edge. Without it the issue of Ireland
              would not even be an issue.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Sinn Féin leader’s commitment to armed
              struggle — that is, to IRA bombing and murder — is entirely
              incompatible with any genuine commitment to what the motion refers
              to as non-violent and exclusively peaceful and democratic means to
              resolve disputes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fourthly, the motion requiring the Assembly to
              express its sympathy to all those who have been the victims of
              sectarian murder is signed by a member of IRA/Sinn Féin who is a
              convicted murderer. In 1973, Gerry Kelly was convicted, along with
              Marian and Dolores Price, for planting four bombs in London, two
              of which exploded, killing one person and wounding 180 others.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been elevated. It seems that I am now Dr
              Ervine — among many doctors in this place.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We heard an academic qualification of
              sectarianism from Dr Paisley. I can only comment on what I
              understand it to be: namely the degree of brutality and irrational
              division that exists in this society. It is not a one-sided
              situation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should consider the fact that there are
              people who hate each other, yet they know not the person whom they
              hate. That to me seems alien to the human condition, yet we seem
              to be pretty comfortable with it. Having listened to the debate so
              far, one would think that sectarianism was happening only today
              for today, and that it did not lay the foundations of this
              society, and that we were not all generated in an atmosphere of
              hate and bitterness.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was amplified by the amendment proposed by
              my Colleague, Esmond Birnie, which says that the House
              &quot;rejects Republican and Loyalist sectarianism&quot;. What
              does it say about sectarianism in the schools and on the street
              corners — not just that on interfaces or involving
              paramilitaries? There is no mention or hint of the sectarianism
              that is expressed in drawing rooms.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The three amendments seem to suggest that if
              all the bad people would just go away, Northern Ireland would be a
              wonderful place.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In fact, the bad people come from the womb of
              this society. The politics of this society influence the way in
              which they live their lives — the divisive, hateful politics
              that guarantee that the politicians will never want a single
              community, because they benefit so much from a divided one. There
              is no question that we in this Chamber luxuriate in sectarianism,
              because there is great merit in, and benefit to be gained from,
              attacking the other side.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people might suggest that the demise of
              the Alliance Party is a result of its argument that two
              communities should come together and function as one. Recent
              electoral performances suggest that the extremists on both sides
              benefit from the tensions and bitterness of this sectarian,
              divided society. We have a problem that has not been defined by
              the motion or the amendments: our people are sectarian.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since I have been on this earth — and my
              appearance belies my 49 years — I do not remember anyone,
              certainly no one in the political arena, trying to deal with
              sectarianism. All those who have been politicians for a long time
              — or even a short time — should look at their failure even to
              address the issue let alone deal with it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are places in Northern Ireland where
              there are few paramilitaries but a great deal of sectarianism. Of
              course, there are places where there are plenty of paramilitaries
              and plenty of sectarianism: it would be foolish to refute that.
              Our communities, which have been led by many in the Chamber, are
              sectarian, and one could argue that they are encouraged to be so.
              In many ways drawing-room sectarianism is more insidious and
              frightening than working-class sectarianism. At working-class
              level it is brutal, and we see it all the time. However, we can
              deal with it. Many people in the Chamber come from places where
              drawing-room sectarianism is at its worst, and they have
              luxuriated and benefited as society, divided more and more,
              crashes on the rocks.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People have said that the Assembly is out of
              touch when it comes to responding to sectarian trouble on our
              streets: we are not. We are deeply concerned about sectarian
              violence, and we must be deeply involved in the fight against it
              — a point made by David Ervine.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate shows that we are at least starting
              to face up to sectarianism, and that is why it is important.
              However, we are disappointed that there are so many variations of
              wording before the House today. What kind of message does it send
              to the public? This debate should not be about ownership of the
              fight against sectarianism — that is very important. It must be
              about a united front against sectarian bigotry. Through unanimity
              today we can show that we are ready to move forward together. It
              is only if we act together that we can truly fight sectarianism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recall the debate on the motion on
              firefighters’ pay. The DUP supported the UUP amendment. Sinn
              Féin and the PUP withdrew their amendments to support the DUP
              motion amended by the UUP — that is called co-operation.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may not be the real world, but it was the
              Assembly yesterday. Firefighters’ pay is an issue we all believe
              in. Why can we not do the same thing as regards sectarianism? I
              accept that perhaps we are not ready to co-operate to the same
              extent; however, we must move towards that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need action, not just fine words. Members
              should be aware of their responsibilities because just as
              leadership against sectarianism can calm a situation, inflammatory
              rhetoric can make divisions more bitter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alex Attwood talked about the three phases of
              dealing with sectarianism. In the short term, we must tackle and
              control the naked violence that results from sectarianism.
              However, in the long term, we must also tackle the drawing-room
              sectarianism that Mr Ervine mentioned. Therefore we propose that
              politicians adopt a code of conduct for dealing with interface
              violence; that they commit themselves to that code and do not play
              the blame game or seek to score points, which makes divisions
              worse. They must try to meet or to visit all sides in a conflict
              if they are to get involved.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Séamus Close that we must have
              support for the PSNI. If we ask the police to protect people on
              all sides and contain the violent clashes on our streets, they
              must have the support of all politicians.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Political dialogue must go beyond scribbled
              sectarian slogans on walls or megaphone diplomacy using
              loudhailers and the media. Politicians must get together in a room
              and look for practical steps that they can take.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Women’s Coalition welcomes the initiative
              of the Northern Ireland Office Minister, Des Brown, to tackle the
              problem and to get all parties involved. However, my party
              recognises that sectarianism will not disappear overnight; it
              would be unrealistic to expect that. Sectarianism must be
              challenged on all fronts — in education, the media, community
              relations, schools and churches, and by politicians.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recent report produced for Barnardo’s by
              the University of Ulster, which cites three-year-olds who use
              sectarian language, proves a point that I have not heard mentioned
              in the debate — the value of integrated education. Where is
              integrated education in the Assembly’s long-term strategy of
              trying to understand one another? The integrated education model
              is superb for those reasons, but where is the political support
              for it? Where are the resources for integrated education?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Advertising campaigns and more support for
              community workers are required. The work of community workers in
              interface areas is praised, but why must they scramble for money
              to get the resources that they need? There have been amazing
              initiatives that have provided much help, but much more is needed.
              Experts must be gathered together in a forum so that they can
              tackle sectarianism together.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Women’s Coalition welcomes Sinn Féin’s
              reaffirmation of its commitment to non-violence and to the
              resolution of disputes through exclusively peaceful means.
              However, the motion should go further, and although my party
              believes that the SDLP’s amendment does go further, it does not
              go far enough.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tabling of the motion by members of
              IRA/Sinn Féin represents a new height in monumental,
              gut-wrenching hypocrisy. Mr Adams might like to tell the House
              what contribution he made against sectarianism when he carried the
              coffin of a man who murdered nine innocent people in a fish shop.
              The Minister of Education might like to inform the House of the
              part that he played in the death of Mr Gillespie at a checkpoint
              in Derry. Various others could make contributions about the La Mon
              House Hotel, Kingsmills, the Droppin’ Well and countless other
              atrocities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The truth is that every party in the Assembly
              has its own definition of sectarianism, and every party thinks
              that sectarianism comes from the other side. Therefore, no party
              has any difficulty in condemning sectarianism, as the various
              shades of condemnation in the motion and the three amendments
              demonstrate. The only dispute is about the exact form of words to
              be used in that condemnation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The truth is that the Assembly is a cathedral
              of sectarianism. That is shown in the institutions, the communal
              designations of Unionist, Nationalist and Other, the d’Hondt
              principles for the selection of Ministers, and the ritual and
              dogma of the sectarianism that is practised in the Assembly. The
              truth is that no one wants to admit that the Assembly is founded
              on institutionalised sectarianism. No one should be surprised that
              a political system that is based and built on sectarianism
              encourages and magnifies that sectarianism throughout society.
              That is happening on the streets as the relationship between the
              two communities deteriorates.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Belfast Agreement has not brought peace. It
              has not brought reconciliation. It has brought into being
              institutions that are guaranteed to increase division and
              community hatred, and to foment the sort of confrontation that is
              seen on the streets. The public is entitled to be dissatisfied
              with the efforts of a political class that aggravates a problem
              and then blames everyone else because things are getting worse. I
              referred to that yesterday in a question to the Deputy First
              Minister during Question Time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood spoke about purging and prosecuting
              everyone, including parties and Members. What has the SDLP done
              about Sinn Féin? It has protected Sinn Féin on every occasion
              that an attempt was made to purge it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What have the Ulster Unionists done about the
              PUP? They utilised their votes to have the First Minister — an
              Ulster Unionist — elected. The truth is that sectarianism is
              rife and manifest throughout all the institutions of the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An American politician was once asked,
              &quot;What is your position on sin?&quot;. He readily replied,
              &quot;I am agin it.&quot; In a similar way, all parties in the
              Assembly are piously queuing up to condemn sectarianism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine, whose usual performance is an
              amalgam of Martin Luther King, Mother Teresa and the local
              probation officer, tells us of dreadful sectarianism in the
              drawing room while the organisation that he fronts is shooting,
              murdering, beating, exiling and intimidating its own
              co-religionists. Exactly the same thing is happening among the
              party and Members of the group represented by that other newfound
              member of the piety association, Gerry Kelly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The truth is that the Assembly should be
              leading the way by purging those representatives in the Assembly
              who front the paramilitaries, who in turn benefit from the
              exploitation of the people on the street. That must be our first
              step.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I
              support the Sinn Féin motion, which simply seeks the support of
              Members in rejecting sectarianism and committing ourselves to
              provide leadership in practical ways on that issue. All three
              amendments seek to avoid the issue by turning the debate on
              sectarianism — the sickness that has afflicted the north-eastern
              part of Ireland for hundreds of years — into a debate on whether
              the RUC, or whatever name it now goes under, is acceptable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Should we be surprised? Politicians who have
              refused to acknowledge their part in the sectarian violence of the
              past years and have abandoned any attempts to address the issue
              can only seek to hide behind an organisation founded on the
              sectarian headcount of a Protestant state for a Protestant people
              and a Protestant paramilitary police force, whose inbuilt
              allegiance was to uphold that state.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ethos is still the same. Where else in the
              world would an assistant chief constable unequivocally state that
              an illegal organisation, the UDA, is behind the sectarian violence
              in north Belfast, which resulted in shots and blast bombs being
              fired from Tiger’s Bay at the police and army, and do nothing
              about it? There were no house searches or arrests, and no UDA
              leaders were even questioned.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can you imagine what would happen if the
              Assistant Chief Constable said that the IRA was responsible for
              throwing blast bombs at the police? Unionists would be fighting
              their way to John Reid and the media demanding action, and we
              would be picking the bodies of Nationalists off the ground.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People looking into the communal disturbances,
              which are the essence of the motion, may wonder at the utterances
              from Unionist politicians who, rather than confront sectarianism,
              are seeking to excuse the violent excesses of their community that
              Alan McQuillan talked about, and which they euphemistically
              describe as law-abiding citizenship.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What’s new? Religious violence, sectarianism
              and Unionism are inextricably linked — it has been that way
              since 1830. If people want to understand the connection, they
              should read Andrew Boyd’s book, ‘Holy War in Belfast’, which
              says a great deal about sects and even more about clergymen
              fermenting sectarianism. He attributes the rise in sectarian
              violence then as a reaction to the tolerant and liberal alliance
              between Catholics and Presbyterians in the early 1800s; an
              alliance that the English and the wealthy landlord class sought to
              destroy through the vehicles of Orangeism and class conflict.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Orange Order generated the first religious
              sectarian riots in Belfast, and it still generates them.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The essayist Robert Lynd once wrote that all
              history is but a repetition of the same story, with variations. We
              can trace the history of sectarianism and violence from the Sandy
              Row riots in 1835 to Drumcree, the Ardoyne, Tiger’s Bay and all
              the interface violence that has inflicted so much suffering on
              those communities that have been on the receiving end. Sectarian
              murder, intimidation, threats and violence, whether against
              schoolchildren, workers or community leaders, are evils that must
              be eradicated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is sad to see a new generation of Loyalist
              paramilitaries — many of whom are no more than young people —
              involved in violent sectarianism that does not even attempt to
              disguise itself as a political front. Why should people be
              surprised if the pathological nature of sectarianism, especially
              in the working-class Unionist population, is worked out against
              that small Catholic enclave in the Short Strand, Skegoneill or
              Holy Cross Primary School? It merely carries on the tradition of
              Harryville, Garvaghy Road and the burning of the little Quinn
              children in Ballymoney. After all, they are carrying on the
              tradition of the north Belfast community that spawned the Shankill
              Butchers. It is not surprising that the majority of sectarian
              violence takes place in the traditional Unionist strongholds of
              north and east Belfast, Coleraine and Antrim, which are areas
              represented by DUP Assemblymen — [<i>Interruption</i>].</p>

              its political bankruptcy. It has shown Sinn Féin’s inability to
              decommission that bunker mentality that leads it to deny that
              those to whom it is inextricably linked are up to their necks in
              the orchestration of sectarian violence where and when they want
              it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the pertinent question is why they want
              it and, more specifically, why they want it now. Could the scandal
              of sectarian attacks in Cluan Place literally have provided a
              convenient smokescreen to divert attention from those embarrassing
              adventures in Castlereagh, Cuba and Colombia? Could the Sinn Féin/IRA
              dilemma be so serious that, not content with 200 serious attacks
              on Orange Halls and with preventing Orange parades passing along
              major thoroughfares, the only way that it can find to employ its
              foot soldiers is to engage them in physical attacks on Orangemen
              and isolated Protestant communities?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps it is a cynical attempt to divert media
              attention from the continuing failure of Sinn Féin/IRA to honour
              its commitment to decommission fully. I am sure that the mover of
              the motion can offer an insight into that situation. After all, he
              appears to have been present at more Orange parades than the Grand
              Master himself.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The continuing Republican pogrom against the
              elderly and vulnerable residents of the White City, Glenbryn and
              Twaddell Avenue was suddenly switched, as if by magic, to include
              the isolated communities of Thistle Court and Cluan Place. Why?
              Perhaps it was not for the reasons that I have outlined. Perhaps
              Republican habits die hard and the tactics that led to the
              expulsion of Protestants from the border areas, the west bank of
              the Foyle, and Churchill Park, Ballyoran Park and Garvaghy Road in
              Portadown are too engrained in the Republican psyche.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps they are not democrats at all, but are
              merely pursuing their war by other means. That is why they have
              such difficulty saying that the war is over. Today presents an
              opportunity for the mover of the motion and his Colleagues to
              assure the House that they totally and unequivocally reject
              attacks by Republicans on those besieged communities. They may
              also avail themselves of the opportunity provided by this debate
              to call for the immediate and total cessation of those attacks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this point I should mention that when a
              Catholic workman in my East Antrim constituency was murdered by
              Loyalists I, together with the local community, unreservedly
              condemned that killing. On President Clinton’s second visit to
              this Building, I referred to that killing to illustrate the need
              for total decommissioning by all paramilitaries, using the
              following words:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Mr President, anyone, anywhere, at any
              time with access to illegal weapons can commit the sort of murder
              that was recently perpetrated in my constituency. It must
              stop!&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Needless to say, President Clinton agreed to
              work towards the cessation of such acts.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was under the impression that every Member
              was pledged to remove such violence from our streets. Sadly, it is
              obvious that some still cannot decommission that mindset and are
              willing to pursue the &quot;blame game&quot; approach. They remind
              me of the alcoholic, whose first step towards salvation is to
              admit that he has a problem. Until Sinn Féin members admit that
              they have a problem, they are caught in their straitjacket. They
              blame the Loyalists, the Unionists, the Orange Order, the RUC and
              the PSNI. Only last night, they blamed the police ombudsman. It is
              no wonder that they oppose the installation of closed-circuit
              television cameras at interface areas, or that existing cameras
              are subject to sustained attack to put them out of action. Why the
              sudden reluctance to use the power of the media, after so many
              successful years of manipulating it? The video cameras and other
              evidence from the White City and Twaddell Avenue show a very
              different face of the real Republican approach to sectarian
              violence, and it is not a pleasant sight.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, Mr Maskey, whose name is also on the
              motion, has failed to grasp that the activities of his
              organisation over the years have led to the perception of the flag
              which he recently installed in his office as a sectarian symbol
              rather than the flag of a neighbouring European state.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The origin and definition of sectarianism have
              been stated clearly. Sectarianism is the creation of Roman
              Catholicism. In Ireland, that was always a stated doctrinal
              position. Some Members will remember the slogan repeated in this
              generation: &quot;A Catholic school for Catholic pupils by
              Catholic teachers&quot;. Cardinal Connell got it right. He was
              stating the sectarian, domineering position that the Church always
              aspired to hold. That meant that, although it could be lax in its
              doctrine, it was always intolerant of the legitimate demands of
              others.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the hallmark of sectarianism, and it
              has been injected into the political life of practically every
              century of our history. The greatest sectarian position was taken
              in universities and schools. It was followed, however, by the very
              serious destroying, disestablishing and dismantling of anything
              that was considered an obstacle to the Church’s domineering
              position.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That pursuit and that position are being
              repeated. Violence, intimidation and all other expedients can be
              accommodated as long as they assist in the pursuit of domination.
              That is the theological equivalent of those who moved the motion
              today, a political statement of a theological position. In 1904,
              &quot;Ourselves alone&quot; was the political equivalent of the
              theological position of the proposer’s church. More recently,
              the term &quot;Tiocfaidh ár lá&quot; may have been used, but it
              has the same meaning and domination and is the sectarian
              equivalent.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, I have only a few seconds left.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are those who try to escape and deny
              their sectarian heritage. I was amazed to hear some of the
              statements made here today. Robert McCartney was right to say that
              the Belfast Agreement is institutionalised sectarianism, and
              Members must accept that, because it was the wish of many.
              Advocates of the Belfast Agreement view it as the road to their
              aspiration of a united Ireland, whether under the slogan &quot;Tiocfaidh
              ár lá&quot; or &quot;Ourselves alone&quot;, or through another
              sectarian creation of the church. Perhaps the greatest example of
              this last occurred just over two decades ago when, on the command
              of the Sinn Féin/IRA leadership, the hunger strikers committed
              suicide to order. The church could not allow such sectarian
              domination to be hijacked and, therefore, it provided the golden
              cross of absolution.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Institutional sectarianism is a part of their
              church, but it is also practised in their politics and enunciated
              in every slogan. Just as, then, I had nothing whatsoever —</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the amendment in the name of Alex
              Attwood. I have some reservations about the motion, which
              addresses sectarian murder only. I would like to expand its remit
              to include all murder, because all murder is wrong, regardless of
              the circumstances in which it occurs. The words &quot;in recent
              times&quot; also cause me concern. Has a line been drawn in the
              sand under a time before which murder was acceptable? Murder is
              wrong, regardless of when it is committed or by whom.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Members who spoke mentioned hypocrisy,
              which has been plentiful. The DUP has attempted to blame the
              Catholic Church for everything that is wrong with society. Did the
              Catholic Church make the death threats that stopped Neil Lennon
              playing at Windsor Park? Sectarianism has been institutionalised
              since this state’s foundation in a Protestant parliament for a
              Protestant people. Robert McCartney rightly said that the Assembly
              was founded on sectarianism, but the institutions are seeking to
              change that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mary Nelis was right about the
              institutionalised sectarianism of the Orange Order. When it
              realised that Catholics and Presbyterians could unite under the
              common name of an Irishman, it did what it could to divide and
              conquer by admitting Presbyterians for the first time.</p>

              the White City area, Glenbryn and other Loyalist communities in
              north Belfast. Mr Attwood’s amendment mentions the protection of
              vulnerable communities everywhere. Mr K Robinson and I represent
              the East Antrim constituency, but he has not said one word about
              Greenisland, Carrickfergus or Larne. There have been hundreds of
              attacks against Catholic communities in those areas over the past
              few years. In the 1970s, over 400 Catholic children attended a
              school in Greenisland, but that school closed in 1992 with only 27
              pupils. That is ethnic cleansing. We have seen —</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker — my apologies
              to the Chair for disregarding that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood’s amendment seeks to protect
              vulnerable communities. Some of what has been cobbled together to
              protect vulnerable communities actually benefits those who live in
              ghettos. For example, the Department for Social Development,
              through the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, has cobbled
              together schemes that allow people who live on interfaces to
              receive £1,500 to support the security of their homes. However,
              minority communities living in majority areas receive nothing. I
              would like to see such schemes being extended to everyone to
              ensure that proper community support is available to all: we have
              a duty to promote good relations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must oppose sectarian displays such as those
              mentioned in Mr Attwood’s amendment. People begin by marking the
              kerbstones in their colours, be they green, white and orange or
              red, white and blue. Then flags go up on lamp-posts and murals
              appear on walls to create a chill factor for the minority living
              in those communities. The institutions and Departments are
              reluctant to intervene and remove such symbols of hatred: that
              must be addressed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the underlying issue is sectarianism.
              It is a cancer in our society, and it must be rooted out if we are
              all to move together to a more prosperous and beneficial society.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After all that has been said today, sincerity
              may be a big word to consider. I must ask whether the Sinn Féin
              motion represents a road to Damascus conversion or is merely for
              the optics. It is difficult to comprehend the mindset of the
              Republican movement, particularly because it has been associated
              with so much terrorism over the years and still jumps to the
              defence of terrorists when the net is closing in on them. Is Sinn
              Féin involved in mere oratory; making deep noises from the chest
              sound like important messages from the brain? Take, for instance,
              the Colombia trio, Castlereagh, and the commemoration activity
              that occasionally occurs for those who terrorised this community
              over the past three decades.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Terrorism occurred all over the Province, but I
              refer to my own constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone. When
              we talk about peace, I must ask if people who live along the
              border in my constituency had the right to live free from violence
              and intimidation whether they were at home, school or work. In
              Fermanagh alone, terrorists who were on a mission to put British
              citizens out of their homes, farms and businesses murdered 106
              people. There was never a cheep about ethnic cleansing then — I
              wonder what Mrs Nelis has to say about that?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could read a litany of deaths, but I do not
              have time to do so. However, can we ever forget the Enniskillen
              bomb of 8 November 1987? Twelve good people were murdered by the
              infidels whom members of Sinn Féin would pay tribute to for
              fighting a war, as they wrongly call it. Let us not forget that
              after 15 years nobody has been made accountable for the atrocity
              in Enniskillen. That is shameful and disgracefully hurtful to
              those in the town who lost their loved ones on that fateful day.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also feel hurt personally, and I know that
              the wife and family of my cousin, Charles Johnston, are
              heartbroken at the murder near St Anne’s Cathedral in Belfast in
              1981 of a dear husband and father. To this day nothing has been
              seen or heard of the murdering scum who, for no reason, committed
              that terrible act against someone who did a decent day’s work
              for a decent day’s pay. That family, like many others in the
              community, never enjoyed a long life together, because terrorism
              roamed the streets and byways of our country, and murdered and
              maimed remorselessly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sectarianism is still being perpetuated by the
              continued thrust of Republicanism despite the Belfast Agreement,
              which committed those who accepted it to recognise Northern
              Ireland as part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
              Northern Ireland so long as the majority so declare through the
              ballot box. By hoisting the tricolour in the city hall, Alex
              Maskey further perpetuates sectarianism, and Alex needs to realise
              that there is equality and parity of esteem within the system, but
              not of the system. There is but one sovereignty — that of Her
              Majesty The Queen. There is but one sovereign flag — the Union
              flag. Alex should try to fulfil the agreement fully, and he should
              not try to claw back what he and his party have accepted, or said
              they accepted, in 1998 — or perhaps he is as insincere as this
              pretentious motion really is.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my home town of Enniskillen, Sinn Féin,
              along with the SDLP, is taking down all emblems of Britishness in
              the town hall. That is sickening. It even extends to removing
              Somme and British Legion certificates, which is disgraceful. I
              hope that the motion is genuine, although Sinn Féin has still to
              convince me, because, on past and present experiences, there is no
              spectacle as ridiculous as Sinn Féin in one of its periodic fits
              of morality.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is common knowledge that Sinn Féin, over
              the years, has associated itself with those who have burned our

              people. It is said that &quot;by their fruits ye shall know
              them&quot;. Why does Sinn Féin not declare its intent to
              recognise the state of Northern Ireland, as provided for in the
              agreement? Regrettably, it instead continues to perpetuate
              division by its continued thrust against this jurisdiction, and
              hence sectarianism arises. Why can we not all work together
              peaceably so that all our citizens can enjoy better times ahead?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is disgraceful. It is saying that only
              those who have been murdered and terrorised in recent times should
              receive sympathy, and should receive it from this source. Sinn
              Féin wants to forget the past and introduce political amnesia. It
              is saying that sectarianism is not all right today, but it was all
              right yesterday. According to Sinn Féin, sectarianism was fine
              before April 1998, and it was all right to terrorise and to murder
              up to that date. IRA/Sinn Féin would not want to condemn the La
              Mon House massacre or those of Bloody Friday, Teebane, Shankill,
              Claudy, Whitecross or Kingsmills, to name a few, because Sinn
              Féin was up to its eyeballs in it. There are people sitting in
              this Chamber who helped to organise, and who were involved to the
              highest level in setting off, some of those bombs, murdering
              people simply because they were Protestants. Here they are today,
              crying crocodile tears about sectarianism and terrorism, after
              they have terrorised the community to get what they want over the
              years. That has not just affected Protestants. Roman Catholics
              have been, and still are being, terrorised by IRA/Sinn Féin.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If people wanted to see what was in the heart
              of IRA/Sinn Féin today, they had only to listen to the sectarian
              bile pouring out of Mary Nelis as she made her sectarian speech.
              Sinn Féin/IRA recommends that the Police Service of Northern
              Ireland be treated in the same way that the RUC was treated. What
              happened to the RUC? More than 300 members lost their lives, and
              almost 10,000 were injured in attacks by the IRA and their
              cohorts. Sinn Féin tells us that the Police Service of Northern
              Ireland should be treated in the same way, and in the next breath
              it tells the Assembly that it is against sectarianism and
              violence. It is up to its eyeballs in violence right now.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have obtained some information about how the
              conflict began in the Short Strand area. The Army and police moved
              in to make several house searches in Short Strand. Sinn Féin was
              concerned because weapons were being held in safe houses in that
              area, and immediately instigated a riot to divert the Army away
              from its legitimate business. That riot began the sectarian
              conflict at the Short Strand interface.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin deplores Protestants and says that
              the Protestant UDA is up to its eyeballs in the conflict. However,
              it claims that the Roman Catholic IRA has nothing to do with it. I
              use that term because Sinn Féin introduced the term
              &quot;Protestant UDA&quot; earlier in the debate. The facts are
              that of the 22 houses in that east Belfast area that have been
              vacated, 19 were vacated by Protestant families, and three by
              Roman Catholic families. All five people shot in that area were
              Protestant — none were Roman Catholic. Sinn Féin/IRA has been
              involved in that. It is responsible for starting the sectarian
              tension in Short Strand and for a great deal of the sectarian
              tension that exists.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP amendment is best placed to state
              Northern Ireland’s position. The Assembly has not previously
              affirmed its commitment to non-violent and exclusively peaceful
              means, and therefore it is not appropriate for Members to reaffirm
              something that they have not already affirmed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I encourage everyone to support the DUP motion,
              and to reject the crocodile tears of Sinn Féin/IRA, which is the
              most sectarian party in Northern Ireland and in this Chamber.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has been a disheartening and disappointing
              debate. The issue of sectarianism goes to the very heart of our
              political problem, and therefore it is perhaps not surprising that
              we have had such a disappointing debate. We heard from the DUP
              that the Catholic Church has stirred up sectarianism, and we heard
              from Sinn Féin that this is primarily a Unionist problem that
              stems from Loyalist paramilitaries. Others have cast blame on
              other sections of the community. The fact is that our society is
              structurally sectarian. That sectarianism is endemic, and if we
              were all honest enough we would accept that we all, to some
              extent, have a degree of sectarianism in our lives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must face up to the realities of
              sectarianism. We must admit that it exists, and, rather than deny
              it, try to address it. Bob McCartney said that the Assembly
              represents institutionalised sectarianism. There may be some truth
              in that. However, if we are to free ourselves of the problems of
              our society, we must learn to manage that sectarianism in order to
              transform our society. I hope that the Assembly and the Executive
              will address sectarianism in a concerted fashion so that we can
              change this society.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The means for tackling sectarianism are in the
              agreement and in our hands. We can transform this society by
              creating a living partnership based on friendship and justice
              between the two political traditions in our society.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, what we have at present is not
              true partnership. We have cold co-existence — some might even
              refer to it as benign apartheid. However, that is unacceptable. We
              have to build a partnership between both traditions to get out of
              the quagmire of sectarianism. Our amendment puts forward practical
              ways of doing that. I welcome the Sinn Féin motion, but I cannot
              agree with it all because it is selective: it qualifies murder,
              and it emphasises the recent instances of sectarianism. However,
              at least it is a step forward for Sinn Féin to now commit itself
              to non-sectarianism, because, unfortunately, its history as a
              party is one of extreme sectarianism. The Republican movement
              became an engine of extreme sectarianism in our society. That is
              the reality.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we see an end to the daubing of streets, the
              misuse of flags, sectarian graffiti and hostile language, then we
              can go forward and redeem our society. Sectarianism is a disease
              — a pathology that affects every aspect of our society. Dr
              Dunlop, the former Moderator of the Presbyterian Church, said that
              sectarianism was a sick form of communal identification. If we
              realise that we have more in common with those on the other side
              of the sectarian divide, then we are taking a step in the right
              direction. Reconciliation must be the goal of the Assembly. Today,
              at least, may be a start in examining the problems of sectarianism
              —bad-tempered and negative though some of the comments have
              been. Perhaps we have taken a step forward.</p>

              Portadown bridge, coupled with the contemporary massacre of 17
              men, women and children in the parish of Drumcree, has come to
              epitomise for them all that occurred throughout Ulster in the year
              of the 1641 rebellion. It was at that time that the sectarian
              battle lines that have dogged Ulster to this day were drawn.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is often forgotten today that towards the
              end of the 18th century Belfast Protestants first promoted the
              idea of an insular Irish nation to unite all classes and creeds,
              while fully supporting Catholic emancipation and attempting to
              revive the ancient music and literature of Ireland. However, after
              Daniel O’Connell’s campaign for a Catholic parliament for a
              Catholic people, Irish Nationalism became identified with Catholic
              Nationalism. By the middle of the 19th century, writers of
              romantic fiction had incorporated the ideal into medieval Gaelic
              Ireland and fostered the mythology of Gaelic patriotic racialism
              into a new Gaelic Nationalism.</p>

              either party were Gaels in language, culture or ethnic origins is
              open to discussion. However, de Valera’s basic Catholic
              Nationalism was highlighted by a radio broadcast on St Patrick’s

              nation is felt to be the Gaelic nation, Catholic by religion.
              Protestants are welcome to join this nation. If they do, they may
              or may not retain their religious profession, but they become as
              it were, Catholic by nationality.&quot;</p>

              Irish Nationalist mythos, which has progressed from being a
              political to an intellectual and finally a spiritual ideal.
              Genuine Loyalist and Unionist fears for their ancient British
              heritage, for their economic well-being, for their religious
              freedom and, last but not least, for their fundamental right to
              self-determination have been dismissed by Nationalist apologists

              an inevitable clash between the two sections of our community.
              Thus, Ulster Protestants have been left to relive their past
              instead of using it to build up a normal national consciousness
              for the present. Derry has been besieged and the Battle of the
              Boyne fought in Belfast over and over again, with Ulster Catholics
              still fighting for Ireland. The complete expression of a native
              Ulster tradition, broader than Irish Protestantism and Catholicism
              and populist in sentiment, could assist our political development
              of a new Ulster based on co-operative democracy. That and that

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sectarianism is ugly and unacceptable in all
              its forms. That does not need declension, categorised definition
              or qualification. In this debate, and using every means at our
              disposal as an Assembly and at our respective disposals as
              parties, we should make that unambiguously clear. Sectarianism
              attacks the vulnerable — vulnerable communities, families,
              workers and children. Sectarianism does not just hurt its victims;
              its also corrupts its carriers. We see the corrosive effect of
              sectarianism in the divisions and tensions in the community. We
              also see sectarianism in the arrogant strut of paramilitary
              violence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate has involved some heated exchanges.
              We must ensure that in our work in the Assembly we respond to the
              violent divisions that are apparent in our community. We will not
              do so through pointing the finger in blame at each other, nor by
              engaging in &quot;whataboutery&quot; in relation to different
              aspects of sectarianism but in making clear that we repudiate and
              renounce all aspects and forms of sectarianism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not a matter of trying to use a debate
              such as this to define sectarianism as belonging predominantly in
              one end of the political spectrum. It is not a matter of using
              this debate to say how clear and pure each of us is from
              sectarianism and that the problem really belongs to someone else.
              It is not a matter of deciding in this debate or elsewhere that
              sectarianism is confined to those streets and areas that most
              graphically suffer from violent sectarianism at the hands of
              paramilitaries. It is not good enough for people in some areas to
              smugly decide &quot;Thank God we are not like some of those
              interface areas in Belfast where people cannot get on.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must recognise the scale and nature of
              sectarianism, and of the response needed from political
              leadership.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome much of the content of the motion and
              the amendments. I will be supporting the SDLP’s amendment, as it
              gives the most rounded, truly balanced and clear-headed response
              to sectarianism. The motion and the other amendments are more
              pointed and partial in different aspects.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, I welcome these declarations that
              Members are opposed to sectarianism and want to stand against it.
              That may be new light out of old windows as far as some parties
              are concerned. When I hear the statements and the renunciation of
              sectarianism I am tempted to recall the observation of Groucho
              Marx that he knew Doris Day &quot;before she was a virgin&quot;.
              People cannot bathe publicly in the waters of a new interest in
              reconciliation while continuing to shower in sectarian attitudes
              at other levels and on other fronts. Many of us can stoke
              sectarian sentiment in our own community by how we say and do
              things. Let all parties ask whether, in some of the things that we
              have done and said, we have been stoking sectarian sentiment
              inside our own communities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our words and actions can stoke sectarian
              resentment in other communities as well. Instead of lecturing each
              other, let us question ourselves and lay down markers and
              standards that we and our parties can adhere to.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sectarianism manifests itself in many ways. Not
              least is the clutter of flags, symbols and ugly, violent graffiti
              that is passed off as a normal and acceptable expression of
              community identity and affinity. It is not. We should not allow
              national flags that mean a unity of different territories to one
              community, and a unity of different religions to another, to
              continue to be abused and used as visual aids to sectarianism in
              the way that parties in this House do.</p>

              party-political approach, the better it will be for us all.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a similar story with Gerry Kelly,
              although he made a speech that was markedly dissimilar to that of
              Mary Nelis. Sinn Féin must reconcile itself to its opposition to
              &quot;violence and intimidation&quot; as stated in its motion.
              Even the best speeches will ring hollow until it can reconcile its
              warm words with what is actually happening in parts of the North,
              where Republicans are involved in the intimidation of PSNI
              trainees and of future SDLP and civilian members of district
              policing partnerships; and until it can demonstrably confirm that
              it is opposed to that intimidation.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several others suggested that people should
              simply support the police. That has not been, and is not now, the
              approach of the SDLP, even now that it is represented on the
              Policing Board. The rigorous and correct approach is to
              acknowledge the police when they get things right, and to
              criticise and challenge them when they get it wrong. If Unionism
              in particular would take that perspective in this debate, we might
              be better informed and better placed to deal with policing and
              sectarianism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How does this debate end? It ends with Sinn
              Féin condemning sectarianism and blaming the Protestant community
              for it. The DUP condemned sectarianism and blamed the Catholic
              Church for it. The UUP condemned sectarianism and listed
              constituencies under threat — all of them were Unionist. As Mark
              Durkan eloquently pointed out, sectarianism infects all sections
              of society. Each side is guilty of it, and each side has suffered
              from it. Combating sectarianism has to begin with an acceptance
              that none of us, inside or outside the Chamber, can afford to
              adopt a high moral tone on sectarianism. All of us, to a greater
              or lesser extent, have contributed to the position that we are now
              in, and we must all contribute to its undoing.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened to much of today’s debate —
              some of it was good, some bad and parts of it downright bad. I was
              interested to hear Mark Durkan’s condemnation of paramilitaries.
              What a pity that he was not as forthright when the Belfast
              Agreement was signed. It would never have been signed if it had
              not been propped up by the paramilitaries who are being castigated
              today for their sectarianism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of all that we have heard, however, I suspect
              that the rant by Mary Nelis will take some beating. I think that
              she lives in cloud cuckoo land, because she certainly does not
              live on this planet. Some of the stuff that she comes out with
              beggars belief. I wonder at times where she is. She belongs to a
              party that is inextricably linked to the most ruthless killing
              machine in the whole of the Western world. For 30&nbsp;years, it
              has carried out a naked sectarian terrorist campaign in this
              country. It waged war along the border and drove the Protestants
              from it. It waged war at La Mon, in Enniskillen, Teebane, Darkley
              and Warrenpoint; on Bloody Friday, in Omagh, at the Droppin’
              Well, on the Shankill, and on police stations, including Newry RUC
              station; with human bombs, ethnic cleansing, and against civilians
              working in Army bases.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet they sit here today, and some of them would
              make a powerful stand-in for Worzel Gummidge. They have a pious
              look on their faces, yet they are at the cutting edge of naked
              sectarianism that has been waged in this country for
              30&nbsp;years. This debate has been brought about as a result of
              their hypocrisy. Members on the Benches opposite them realise that
              they are looking into the face of sectarianism in its most
              ruthless form. [<i>Interruption</i>]. I can understand why you
              would not look in the mirror.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jane Morrice also mentioned the clergy. Will
              she cast her mind back a few weeks to an incident in Randalstown
              when a minister led his congregation with the news of the Gospel?
              How was he treated? He was treated in a most ruthless, sectarian
              manner; the congregation was taken apart and its instruments
              smashed into tiny pieces. That was done in the name of
              Republicanism. What support did he get from those who tell us
              that, in this ecumenical age, we are all together? One minister
              phoned him and apologised. Where were the hundreds and thousands
              of others? What were they doing? I suspect that by their silence
              they were giving consent to what happened.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP’s amendment contains what is missing
              in most of the others. Mr Attwood from west Belfast is a member of
              the Policing Board. I am amazed that he cannot bring himself to
              state publicly that Members should throw their lot behind the
              agencies of law and order. He has not said that because it would
              not be politically expedient for him to do so, and, on occasion,
              the SDLP want somehow to out-Sinn Féin Sinn Féin. Instead of
              drawing a definitive line between the two and saying that the SDLP
              is different, what does it do? It sidles up to Sinn Féin and
              gives it succour and support when it should be treated as the
              cast-out of society. Remember what Sinn Féin has been involved in
              over the years, yet its representatives come to the Chamber as if
              they were statesmen, as if the past 30 years never happened and
              was all just a bad dream.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge Members, before they cast their votes,
              to consider what the DUP is trying to achieve. The Assembly has
              been sectarianised because there has to be a sectarian headcount
              for every important vote — sectarianism has, in fact, been
              institutionalised.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP amendment corrects at least some of
              the flaws in the Sinn Féin motion; the DUP amendment correctly
              notes that ceasefires have been breached; and in the UUP amendment
              the word &quot;re-affirms&quot; could be replaced by
              &quot;affirms&quot;. With regard to the motion, it is not for the
              Assembly to affirm its commitment to non-violence — that is for
              the IRA and Loyalist paramilitaries to do. It is Sinn Féin, not
              the Assembly, that must demonstrate that it truly believes that
              all sections of the community have the right to live free from
              violence by encouraging IRA inactivity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly does not need to express its
              sympathy to victims of violence by means of this orchestrated,
              manipulative and insincere motion. It is the IRA by its terrorism,
              and Sinn Féin by its continued hypocrisy, who have proven
              themselves to be institutionally sectarian. To support the motion
              would be to mock the victims of the troubles since 1969.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The wording of the motion bears striking
              similarities to the so-called &quot;apology&quot; from the IRA of
              a few months ago. There is no mention of the security force
              members who were killed by the IRA and whose deaths were not at
              that time, or this afternoon, condemned by Sinn Féin. That is one
              of the most disturbing features of the motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the PSNI, the Sinn Féin

              debate.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
              First, I want to return to the motion in my name and in Gerry
              Kelly’s, to make the point that it is in the spirit of
              sub-priority 2 of section 2.4, entitled ‘Growing as a Community’,
              in the Programme for Government. The motion was deliberately
              designed to allow Members to give support and encouragement to the
              public, to offer some way out of the sectarianism that we face and
              to help to bring an end to the discrimination, death and
              destruction which afflict many communities in the North.
              Therefore, the motion, by its very nature, is not prescriptive or
              partial, and it is open-ended.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin rejects and opposes all forms of
              sectarianism — be it murder or whatever — for ever and a day.
              We oppose sectarianism totally, and we will stand accountable,
              like any other political party, to the public on that stance. I
              remind the public that all parties present had the opportunity to
              propose a motion this week, or at any other time, but none of them
              saw fit to do that. People can draw their own conclusions from
              that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Sinn Féin motion is designed to have a
              debate about sectarianism. Although listeners to the debate may
              find it hard to detect, sectarianism is a problem that transcends
              Republicanism, policing, and it transcends any one section of our
              community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Deputy First Minister for his
              contribution, and for his acknowledgement of the issue and of the
              fact that sectarianism is all-pervasive. It is regrettable that
              the First Minister and other Members of the Executive have not
              contributed this afternoon. No one here can say that they have no
              responsibility or that they have all the answers. We need an
              inclusive, rational debate on sectarianism in which Members can
              put their analysis and solutions on the table. Regrettably, I have
              heard very few solutions this afternoon. All our constituents want
              answers and solutions. They do not want the finger-pointing which,
              for the most part, is simply an excuse for those who make those
              allegations and arguments to do nothing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also clear that there is a need for a
              forum for all sections of society to participate in and to shape a
              campaign that will tackle sectarianism in all its forms. If the
              motion is passed today — and even if it is not passed — it
              shows that the Assembly can provide that forum. Sinn Féin has an
              analysis of what may or may not constitute sectarianism. The
              substance of the amendments today is simply that if Sinn Féin
              were to support the PSNI, our problems would no longer exist. That
              is not the simple answer. Unfortunately, if you believe Alan
              McQuillan’s comments last week — and you do not have to —
              the bulk of the violence came from Loyalists. That community very
              strongly supports the police and all their policing structures.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recent months, the SDLP has not stopped
              running to the NIO, delegation after delegation, to complain that
              the PSNI is a part of the problem in so far as it is not giving
              protection to vulnerable communities. Regrettably, policing is
              still part of the problem, and that is why we did not include it
              in our motion. However, we stand ready to debate all forms of
              sectarianism and all solutions to tackle it, because the people
              that we all represent deserve and want much better.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today very few Members made any specific
              proposals, other than some generalised suggestions such as
              telephone link-ups, which are being dealt with at implementation
              group level. Sinn Féin made some of those suggestions during
              discussions. Many Members spent their time criticising Sinn Féin,
              and none of them have accepted that they are responsible for any
              of the attitudes, policies or actions that ferment sectarianism in
              society. If you are listening to this debate or you were listening
              to a radio programme at lunchtime, you would be forgiven for
              thinking, four years after the establishment of the Assembly,
              &quot;is this the best that they can do?&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should be debating the strategy that the
              Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister was
              supposed to introduce this year. That strategy ought to lead to a
              cross-departmental plan to tackle sectarianism and offer solutions
              to our communities.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is now September 2002. We are a long way
              behind schedule in our attempts to deal with one of the biggest
              scourges of our society — sectarianism — and the death and
              destruction that it has caused in the streets. Although I commend
              the Deputy First Minister’s contribution, we should be debating
              a fully thought-out, advanced strategy for solving the problems.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to be positive. Despite the negativity
              that was displayed today, Belfast City Council carried out good
              work in July when the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
              First Minister was on holiday. The political leaders and the
              Departments were not available to tackle the many difficulties
              that faced communities. I spoke to Loyalist residents in east
              Belfast, the NIO, the Housing Executive and many other
              organisations about repairing houses and reinstating tenants. No
              senior officials were available from any Department.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite Belfast City Council’s history, local
              councillors were able to meet in July and organise a rally with
              the trade union movement, the Churches and the private sector.
              They agreed to form a working group on sectarianism, which will
              meet for the first time later this month. Despite what some
              politicians said today, their party colleagues on Belfast City
              Council have been working together. They organised a programme of
              work and sought nominations to the working group. That sends out
              an encouraging and positive message. Despite difficulties, various
              analyses and differences of opinion about the origins of the
              conflict and the causes and definition of sectarianism,
              councillors did come together. That contrasts with today’s
              debate. I hope that Belfast City Council will be able to
              demonstrate to the people of Belfast — perhaps for the first
              time and belatedly — that it is starting to agree on steps to
              tackle sectarianism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will all stand in the spotlight, all stand
              accused. Today I heard lily-white, halo-laden people deny that
              they had anything to do with sectarianism and say that it was not
              their problem. As Mark Durkan and other Members said, sectarianism
              is all-pervasive and has existed for a long time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite all the nonsense that has been spewed
              out this afternoon, let us agree that there is a period of
              relative calm in some areas in Belfast. That is because many
              people have worked hard behind the scenes to bring a lull to those
              areas and achieve peace and respect in both the Unionist and
              Nationalist communities. Those communities deserve better from
              their political leadership.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If I was not a politician, and I listened to
              some of the contributions, I would advocate closing the Assembly,
              because if that is the best that Members can offer, they should
              not be here. I am delighted that the parties whose Members are
              here and have offered nothing but negativity and criticism are
              given much better and more mature leadership in local councils.
              Sinn Féin rejects the amendments, because they are not a total
              solution.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before the Assembly rose for summer recess, the
              Minister for Regional Development presented his Department’s
              10-year regional transportation strategy (RTS) to the Assembly. I
              participated in that debate, broadly welcoming the RTS and its
              many positive aspects, which, if implemented, would improve the
              transportation infrastructure of Northern Ireland. However, there
              was insufficient time to address aspects of the RTS relating to
              the West Tyrone constituency, in particular the upgrading and
              maintenance of A-class roads.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Madam Deputy Speaker [Ms Morrice] in the
              Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not the purpose of the debate to
              castigate Roads Service, which has had to make do with limited
              resources and has completed several worthwhile schemes in the
              Omagh District Council and Strabane District Council areas
              designed to calm and relieve traffic congestion. The intention is
              to discuss flaws in the RTS in relation to West Tyrone’s A-class
              roads, and to contribute to the wider debate on the future of the
              transportation infrastructure in that part of Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue is important because it raises
              questions about the Department’s commitment to social justice
              and equality in border constituencies such as West Tyrone, and to
              balanced sustainable development across Northern Ireland. It also
              raises issues about the Department’s commitment to working with
              the National Roads Authority in the Irish Republic and the need to
              achieve a truly integrated transportation network on the island.
              Therefore, despite its many positive aspects, there have been
              serious omissions from the RTS, particularly in relation to
              A-class roads, an issue of concern to many in West Tyrone.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Geographically, West Tyrone is the largest of
              the constituencies, with a population of over 140,000. In terms of
              transportation infrastructure, the constituency is totally
              dependent on roads due the non-existence of a rail network. It is
              difficult to overestimate the importance of the condition of roads
              to the social and economic life of the constituents. West Tyrone
              is served by the A5, the main arterial route and a designated
              trans-European network (TEN) route that runs between Ballygawley
              and Derry and passes through the towns of Omagh, Newtownstewart
              and Strabane. It also has two further A-class roads; the A32
              connecting Omagh to Enniskillen, and the A505 that runs between
              Omagh and Cookstown.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the importance attached by the RTS to
              such TEN routes as the A5, which are essential to European
              integration, economic prosperity and generating employment. The
              TEN routes have an important role in ensuring the free movement in
              the European Union of goods, services and people, which reinforces
              social and economic cohesion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the work currently being carried out
              on the A5. That includes stage 2 of the Strabane bypass, the
              Newtownstewart bypass and stage 3 of the Omagh throughpass, which
              has fallen in the list of priorities since the Chancellor’s 1998
              initiative and awaits the completion of the remaining statutory
              procedures before construction can begin.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am, however, disappointed that the A5 TEN
              route, although one of the five designated key transport corridors
              in the RTS, may not get the capital investment necessary to
              upgrade it to dual carriageway standard. West Tyrone has not a
              single mile of dual carriageway or motorway. The RTS proposes to
              widen the A5 only at selected points. Those are merely gestures,
              and the road between Omagh and Ballygawley remains treacherous.
              The recognition of the A5 as a key transport corridor in the RTS
              will remain an illusion if the necessary capital investment is not
              made to upgrade it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Currently the A5 is a 7·3-metre-wide single
              carriageway, and it is inadequate for the volume of traffic it
              carries. Furthermore, it makes a mockery of the RTS objective of
              decreasing public transport journey times. That is unacceptable,
              given the importance of the route to West Tyrone’s local economy
              and the need to facilitate cross-border trade via the N2 in the
              South. In the common chapter of the Northern Ireland structural
              funds plan and the Republic’s National Development Plan 2000-06,
              the co-ordination of transport planning and construction is a key
              area for co-operation. If we are to develop a socially-inclusive
              economy in Northern Ireland, we must invest in transportation
              infrastructure which is safe, accessible and integrated on an
              all-island basis.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker — I am sorry if I
              earlier called you Mr Deputy Speaker — in the RTS there is no
              reference to the A505 and the A32 roads in West Tyrone, and I draw
              the attention of the House to that. The condition of both roads is
              unacceptable, since they are the main routes between three major
              towns. That the RTS contains no proposals for upgrading those
              routes is a glaring omission. The A32 between Omagh and
              Enniskillen is frequently used by ambulances, often in
              emergencies, to take patients to the Erne Hospital’s maternity
              unit. The A505 between Omagh and Cookstown is used by road haulage
              traffic travelling to the port of Larne.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do acknowledge the great improvement to the
              A32 at Dromore with the new inner ring road which was completed
              last year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ignoring those roads is contrary to the
              principles of balanced regional development across Northern
              Ireland and the stated objective of the regional development
              strategy, the RTS’s mother document, to achieve a modern,
              sustainable, safe transportation system which benefits society,
              the economy and the environment and which actively contributes to
              social inclusion and to everyone’s quality of life.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential that these routes be upgraded,
              for safety reasons as well as for economic ones. The RTS
              highlights the fact that Northern Ireland has the highest number
              of road deaths — more than in any other region of the UK. Both
              the A505 and the A32 are hazardous in many areas. Their narrowness
              effectively reduces the maximum speed to around 40 mph. Many road
              traffic accidents in rural areas can be attributed to that
              narrowness, and many people have lost their lives unnecessarily or
              have been injured.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That brings me to the matter of the maintenance
              backlog of West Tyrone’s A-class roads, which received only 9%
              of the Department for Regional Development’s spending on road
              maintenance during 2001-02. The RTS recognises that it is
              essential that the roads network receive substantial investment to
              upgrade key routes and to deal with the massive maintenance
              backlog, which is particularly acute in rural areas. For example,
              in the Omagh and Strabane districts the most recent figures, from
              a survey carried out in 2001, reveal that the maintenance backlog
              on A-class roads totals almost £8·5 million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is totally unacceptable that the amount
              required to address the maintenance backlog is more than twice the
              total funding of £4·126 million that has been allocated to major
              capital works, minor capital works and road maintenance during the
              same period in those district council areas. That situation cannot
              continue, and I ask the Minister to take the necessary action to
              clear up the road maintenance backlog in the Omagh and Strabane
              District Council areas.</p>
              <i>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Successful regional transportation strategies
              are based on a close relationship between the improvement of
              transportation infrastructure and economic development. The
              provision of an accessible transportation infrastructure is a key
              factor in attracting new inward investment, the siting of new
              industry and the survival of indigenous firms. Transport costs
              have a major effect on the profitability of many businesses,
              especially the food and textile industries, in west Tyrone.
              Therefore, the uneven development of Northern Ireland’s
              transportation infrastructure increases the economic disadvantages
              experienced by peripheral border areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For many years, my party has expressed its
              grave concerns about the lack of a co-ordinated and balanced
              approach to the development of the region’s road infrastructure.
              Unfortunately, those of us who live in rural areas have tolerated
              inadequate roads for many decades. The historic underinvestment in
              west Tyrone’s road network continues to have a detrimental
              effect on the area’s ability to generate further economic growth
              and employment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1964, Northern Ireland’s Minister of Home
              Affairs stated that the continuation of the motorway to Derry, and
              the upgrading of the routes from Omagh to Enniskillen and Omagh to
              Derry, would be a priority. Of course, aside from piecemeal
              improvements, that did not happen. Now that we once again have
              locally elected Ministers and the opportunity to, as the Programme
              for Government states, &quot;make a difference&quot;, it would be
              a tragedy were we to repeat the mistakes of the past.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The need in my constituency does not stop at
              road maintenance. West Tyrone needs a transport system, albeit
              road-based, that is capable of supporting social and economic
              development.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, Deputy Speaker — to avoid Mr Byrne’s
              problem, I left out the terms &quot;Madam&quot; or &quot;Mr&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I support Mr Byrne’s comments, I am
              mindful of the investment that we have seen in west Tyrone, and I
              thank the Minister for it. We are also aware of proposed future
              investment. The main tenet of Mr Byrne’s Adjournment debate is
              that, although we welcome that investment, we realise that the
              bulk of the capital will, necessarily, be spent on one route. I
              thank Mr Byrne for joining me in highlighting that, as the
              Minister knows, the A5 should be a dual carriageway. The Minister
              is well aware of my views on that route, and I appeal to him that,
              when roadworks are undertaken on the A5, he should consider
              allowing land purchase to facilitate its dualling when funds
              become available.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday, the Minister stated that he is often
              hindered by the 30 years of democratic and financial deficit that
              we were plagued with in Northern Ireland. Members appreciate that
              and the efforts that are being made to overcome it. It is,
              however, a great pity that Members from Fermanagh and South Tyrone
              and from Mid Ulster did not stay to hear the debate, because Mr
              Byrne mentioned factors that will assist their constituencies when
              we deal with the Omagh to Enniskillen route and the Omagh to
              Cookstown route. I congratulate Mr Byrne on bringing those routes
              to the House’s attention.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am a little disappointed that the debate has
              been limited to a discussion of A-class roads. There are so few of
              them in West Tyrone, and many of our people use the B-class and
              C-class routes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne referred to the maintenance backlog:
              it is a disgrace to see the state of some of our B-class and
              C-class roads. I am sure that the Minister is aware of the
              backlog, and I urge him to listen to what Mr Byrne has said and to
              hear the pleas of the officials in the western division of the
              Roads Service. That division is pleading for the tools to do the
              job. That is the main tenet of the motion, and I support it.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support my Colleagues in bringing pressure to
              bear on the Department for Regional Development to seriously
              consider the A5, particularly as it has been designated a
              trans-European route. I am grateful that the other representatives
              of West Tyrone have already highlighted the desperate condition of
              the B-class and C-class roads.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must bear in mind that the constituency
              covers a large area: it is over 65 miles long and 49 miles wide.
              Despite that it has only 55 miles of A-class roads. The other
              1,500 miles of road, which represent 95% of the total, are B-class
              and C-class. In a fortnight, councillors from Strabane and Omagh
              are joining me to meet the Minister for Regional Development to
              discuss those roads. This has been a burning issue for many years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to congratulate the Minister,
              because for the first time in 30 years the infrastructural deficit
              and backlog that we suffer in west Tyrone have been recognised.
              The complaints that I receive in the constituency office refer to
              the miles of pipe laying that is taking place for the new water
              mains that are being laid all over the countryside. Many delays
              are being experienced on the A5 because major road schemes are
              under construction.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should recognise that improvements at
              Magheramason, Bready, Burndennet Bridge, Ballykeel, the
              Newtownstewart bypass, and the Garvaghy crossroads, as well as the
              expected Omagh throughpass, are the result of a major
              infrastructural input. I thank the Minister, because until two and
              a half years ago, we in Omagh and Strabane lobbied vigorously, but
              unsuccessfully, for funds. Therefore I recognise that our present
              Minister is the first to have seriously attacked the
              infrastructural backlog.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should also like to thank the Minister and
              his Department for recognising that the backlog existed and for
              skewing funds westward. Approximately £850 million will be
              available over 10 years. However, a significant amount of the
              money has already been earmarked for many of the major projects I
              just mentioned.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must seriously consider improving the A5,
              because it was designed 40 years ago when the maximum number of
              axles allowed for a lorry was two and the maximum weight was 18
              tons. Nowadays, we struggle to overtake six-axled lorries with
              40-ton road weight. At that time, roads were built and engineered
              to a totally different specification than that required today.
              Therefore the Minister and his Department face a dilemma as to how
              to utilise the existing infrastructure. Is a trans-European route
              to be considered because it is not as costly as a dual
              carriageway? Throughout the world, the broad four-lane road with
              two inside crawler lanes used for slower traffic — an old
              concept — has done away with the massive amount of kerbing.
              Instead, the reliance is on white lining, directional lines and
              road signage for road safety. In countries where four-lane roads
              have been constructed they have proved safe and successful and
              have increased traffic through-flow by approximately 28%. That is
              something the Minister and his Department might consider. A
              four-lane road from Dungannon, with a branch to Enniskillen, to
              the Maiden City would have to be costed, but would prove to be
              more cost-effective. The design of the present A5 from Ballygawley
              to the Maiden City means that about 250 projects would have to be
              undertaken to improve safety. It would be single carriage each
              way, which would limit the traffic flow, as it can only proceed at
              the speed of the slowest vehicle.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will benefit everyone if we recognise that
              there is a backlog and that it will take a fair amount of finance
              to resolve the problem of overworn, dilapidated road systems that
              we have inherited. The Department has struggled over the past 30
              years to maintain those roads, but now the B- and C-class roads
              are punishing our transport systems. I have been lobbied
              continuously by the Western Education and Library Board. It is
              having to change the routes its buses take because it will no
              longer permit its new fleet to travel some of those B-class roads
              and all of the C-class roads. The condition of those roads is too
              sore on the bus system. The private transport sector, which is
              becoming more involved in the transport of children, has also
              complained about those roads. My recommendation emanates from
              those two sources. The construction of a four-lane road, all the
              way from Dungannon, with one branch to Enniskillen, right through
              to the Maiden City would cut out many of the major schemes still
              outstanding. Serious consideration should be given to the
              suggestion. I thank Joe Byrne for giving us the opportunity to
              debate this matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The deficit was created by 30 years of mayhem
              and destruction.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had to replace and compensate; now we are
              playing catch-up. I am delighted to say that the Minister has made
              an honourable attempt to give some shape to the future of roads in
              the west.</p>

              </i><b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McElduff:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I
              welcome the debate. I disagree that the problems are attributable
              to the past 30 years. It is more a matter of 80 years of
              institutional neglect of that part of County Tyrone, dating back
              to before the 1920s.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a useful opportunity to articulate the
              urgency of improving and upgrading class-A roads in County Tyrone,
              particularly in the western division area of the Roads Service.
              County Tyrone’s legacy of underinvestment and the deliberate
              policy of discrimination practised there have only accentuated its
              sub-regional peripherality in the North, Ireland as a whole, and
              Europe. Since the demise of the railways in the 1960s, roads are
              the sole mode of transportation. This situation places people in
              the greater north-west at a distinct disadvantage — the debate
              is more about people than it is about roads. The situation
              requires commitment from Departments, and from the Department for
              Regional Development in particular. I acknowledge that the
              Department has been getting to grips with the road situation in
              west Tyrone recently. Schemes such as that in Dromore are very
              positive. Good projects have been carried out, and several are in
              the pipeline, such as the A32 realignment scheme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Regional Development should
              look beyond the Assembly for roads funding for the greater
              north-west, to the European Union, and the Government in the
              South. He should seek a peace dividend to address our
              infrastructural deficit. The A5 is a priority requiring major
              funding to realign the road to accommodate its high usage. It has
              been identified as part of a major trans-European route that
              links, for example, citizens in Omagh to Belfast via the A4 and
              M1, and citizens in Donegal and Derry to Dublin via the A5 and N2.
              The road carries a great deal of cross-border traffic. I remind
              the Minister of a question that I asked some months ago, to which
              he replied. I asked how many miles of dual carriageway there were
              in County Tyrone.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Funding is required from the Assembly and other
              political institutions, although I appreciate the financial
              constraints on the Department. A more holistic approach is needed
              for the upgrading of the A32, which is the main road from
              Enniskillen to Omagh, or Omagh to Enniskillen, if someone were so
              inclined. I appreciate that positive steps have been taken with
              regard to the Dromore bypass and several realignment schemes. I
              urge the Minister to dig the channels and make provision for a
              dual carriageway in the immediate to mid-term future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The A505 from Omagh to Cookstown is an
              important route linking the county town of Tyrone with another
              principal town in Tyrone, and beyond to the M2. The A505 also
              requires major realignment, not least at an important point known
              locally as the Seven Sisters.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cake needs to be made larger in general. I
              urge the Minister to listen to the combined voices of the councils
              and the representatives of the people in those areas affected,
              including Donegal, Omagh, Strabane, Cookstown, Dungannon and
              Fermanagh.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to make the political point that the
              Minister should take his seat at the Executive table, because his
              absence when funds are being distributed is to the detriment of
              the citizens of west Tyrone.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Regional Development (Mr P
              Robinson):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the outset I find myself agreeing with many
              of the points that Members have made, particularly their calls for
              improvement to the strategic highways in west Tyrone, just as I
              would for other parts of Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There can be no doubt that a modern and
              effective transport system is the lifeblood of any modern society.
              For that reason I developed my regional transportation strategy,
              2002-2012, covering transportation strategy for the next decade.
              It proposes significant improvements to our roads, buses, light
              rail and railway infrastructure, and I was delighted when in July
              2002 the House unanimously approved the strategic direction of its
              underlying principles. I stress &quot;unanimously&quot; because,
              as we have seen today, it is not always that our decisions in the
              House are unanimous. The strategy identifies the transportation
              priorities and the investment needed to provide</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a modern, sustainable and safe
              transportation system over the next 10 years&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">— your words, Madam Deputy Speaker, because
              you endorsed them along with the rest of the House when we passed
              the regional development strategy for Northern Ireland 2002-2012,
              the mother of the regional transportation strategy. Such a
              programme will require significantly enhanced investment, yet the
              strategy is pitched at a level that can be realistically achieved.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I do not wish to leave the impression
              that west Tyrone has, in any way, been neglected for funding for
              major road schemes in recent years, and I will review some of my
              Department’s recent achievements in that area. In the last two
              years we have seen the completion of the £2·1 million scheme to
              provide overtaking opportunities on the A5 at Leckpatrick; the
              provision of the A32 Dromore inner link at a cost of almost £1
              million; the £800,000 bridge replacement and realignment scheme
              at Burndennett; and, of course, the £500,000 widening scheme to
              provide overtaking opportunities on the A5 at Tattykeel, south of
              Omagh, which has recently been completed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also have to say that west Tyrone is faring
              reasonably well in major road schemes currently under
              construction, as was shown by the appreciative remarks of some
              Members. We are at stage 2 of the Strabane bypass, which will
              provide 2·6 kilometres of single carriageway, at a cost of £4·2
              million, to bypass one of the most congested stretches of the A5.
              There is also the £8 million Newtownstewart bypass, which will
              provide just under three kilometres of new carriageway. In
              addition, stage 3 of the Omagh throughpass, which will complete
              the throughpass of Omagh at a cost of some £5 million, is going
              through the statutory procedures.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding trunk roads in west Tyrone I am
              pleased to be able to make three important announcements today.
              First, I can tell the House that I expect the Newtownstewart
              bypass to be completed in November 2002, some four months ahead of
              schedule. This will be a welcome early boost to motorists on the
              Omagh to Londonderry road, eliminating the considerable delays to
              traffic currently experienced at that point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, I am pleased to advise that all
              objections to the direction order for stage 3 of the Omagh
              throughpass have been withdrawn as a result of the Roads Service’s
              negotiations with the objectors. This clears the way for us to
              proceed with land acquisition and brings us a crucial step nearer
              to starting this important scheme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, I can announce that in the next
              financial year the Roads Service proposes to construct a further
              overtaking opportunity on the A5 by widening the section from
              Ballygawley roundabout, heading north, to three lanes for a
              distance of approximately 1·3 kilometres. That will again provide
              better opportunities for overtaking. That proposal will be
              assisted by the recently announced investment in road maintenance
              from the reinvestment and reform initiative.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite the number of schemes recently finished
              or in progress in west Tyrone, I assure the House that major work
              schemes are chosen on an impartial and objective basis with the
              aim of benefiting Northern Ireland as a whole.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although a major road scheme on a strategic
              route may be located in one county or one district council area,
              the scheme’s purpose is to improve access to locations along the
              entire route. Mr Hussey made that point to some extent when he
              stated that he wished that Members from Mid Ulster and Fermanagh
              and South Tyrone had attended the debate. He recognised that what
              happens in west Tyrone can affect adjoining constituencies.
              Equally, what happens in adjoining constituencies can be to the
              benefit of west Tyrone. There is a recognition that the purpose of
              the scheme is also to improve access to other locations. For
              example, the £2·2 million scheme to improve the A4 at Eglish and
              Cabragh on the main Belfast to Omagh road will also benefit West
              Tyrone. For this reason it is sometimes misleading to compare
              spending on major road schemes on a constituency or district
              basis.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I advise the Member for West Tyrone, Mr Byrne,
              who is happily smiling at present, not to refer to
              &quot;only&quot; 9% of the maintenance budget’s being spent in
              West Tyrone when any of his Colleagues from other constituencies
              are around. If he multiplies 9% by the 18 constituencies in
              Northern Ireland, he will see that West Tyrone is probably
              receiving over 50% more than the average would permit. The figure
              is based on the principle that is adopted fairly by my Department:
              money goes where the need is. I hope that the Member will
              recognise that the 9% he mentioned in somewhat derisory terms is
              recognition that even though West Tyrone contains approximately
              5·4% of the total population —</p>

              it is getting about 50% more than that for spending on
              maintenance.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is one of several factors. If we want to
              add a few more to the debate, one of the key issues that my
              Department must consider is the amount of use on any road. That
              was one of the factors that militated against the west of the Bann
              generally. It was one of the key reasons for not simply
              extrapolating over the next 10 years the amount of money that we
              would put into our regional transport strategy and for
              determining, even from the draft, that I would have to lift that
              up. Only by lifting that bar considerably higher was it going to
              have the spread right across the Province that West Tyrone and the
              other constituencies west of the Bann deserved.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the major road schemes over the
              past few years, the Roads Service has invested a similar amount on
              minor road improvement schemes across Northern Ireland. The
              resources available for minor capital schemes are allocated to the
              four Roads Service divisions and, in turn, apportioned across
              district council areas on a needs-based priority approach using
              indicators such as population, weighted road lengths and the
              number of accidents. As far as possible, that ensures an equitable
              distribution of funds across the country, and I am satisfied that
              West Tyrone has received an equitable share of those resources.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey spoke of the feeling among western
              division staff that if they were given the tools, they could do
              the job.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that the confidence would be
              well placed in my colleagues in the western division. Equally,
              there would be those in the Department for Regional Development
              who would ask the Assembly for the tools to do the job. We are
              willing to do all the work required across the Province, but we
              need the resources to do that. If the Assembly gives unanimous
              approval to the regional transportation strategy and backs it up
              with the necessary financial support, the western division will
              show that it, and the other divisions, will do the job if they are
              given the tools.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The improvements to the A32 at Lettergesh were
              completed in May this year at a cost of over a quarter of a
              million pounds. In addition, the result of the reform and
              reinvestment initiative bids announced before the holidays in July
              will give an additional £20 million over the next two years for
              structural maintenance improvements on the regional strategic
              transportation network. The Roads Service has already programmed
              schemes for west Tyrone using those additional resources. They
              include improvements to the A32 at Clanabogan near Omagh — I
              hope that I pronounced that correctly for the hon Gentleman —
              starting in October 2002 and costing £220,000; improvements to
              the A32 at Lisdoo between Dromore and Irvinestown starting in
              November 2002 and costing £495,000; and improvements to the A5 at
              Melmount Road, Strabane starting next year and costing £220,000.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne argued that the regional
              transportation strategy should have proposed a dual carriageway
              for the A5, or parts of it, rather than bypasses and overtaking
              opportunity schemes. Any investment must make economic sense, and
              the significant capital cost of a dual carriageway must be offset
              by time savings and other benefits for the traffic-using public.
              Experience shows that on inter-urban roads the minimum traffic
              volume that normally justifies the provision of a dual carriageway
              is about 11,000 vehicles a day. The typical traffic on the
              inter-urban sections of the A5 is just over 9,000 vehicles a day,
              and at times that stretches to 11,000 vehicles a day. That barely
              reaches the minimum threshold where the provision of a dual
              carriageway could be economically justified.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Member give way?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member may want to hear my next sentence.
              The schemes shown in the regional transportation strategy were for
              illustrative purposes and to give some idea of what might be
              delivered by the additional £375 million envisaged for strategic
              highway improvements across Northern Ireland in the 10-year
              period. The illustrative map shows several improvements relevant
              to County Tyrone on top of the schemes already in the programme.
              Therefore the Member cannot say that there would not be a change
              to the illustrative case if he had an argument that convinced the
              Roads Service.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for giving way. I
              understand the objective figures he is working with. However, as
              my Colleagues and I travel to and from Belfast from the western
              area we are aware of the subjective nature of the traffic
              encountered. We are dealing with rural and slow-moving traffic,
              and an economy that is totally dependent on roads. Mr Gibson
              pointed out that a considerable number of large commercial
              vehicles use that road and slow down the travel time.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have given the Member an opportunity to make
              his point. My officials, who will ultimately make recommendations
              to me on these matters, have heard the case. Mr Hussey does not
              have an argument with me, or my Department, about the need for
              road improvements. If I had not put the illustrative map into the
              regional transportation strategy, many Members would be asking
              whether that meant that schemes would go ahead in their areas. We
              have tried to give some indication of what can be done were £375
              million to become available in the way that we have outlined.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also pointed out that the illustrative map
              showed several improvements for County Tyrone as a whole, on top
              of the schemes that are already in the programme, such as
              selective widening. That scheme will provide further overtaking
              opportunities on several stretches of the A5, as well as the
              dualling of the Dungannon to Ballygawley road.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The schemes to be delivered under the regional
              transportation strategy have yet to be finalised, and will be
              progressed through three transport plans. Of those, two are
              relevant to west Tyrone. The regional strategic transport network
              plan will determine a programme of initiatives that includes
              strategic highway schemes, and the sub-regional transport plan
              will do the same for the non-trunk network. The third plan covers
              the Belfast metropolitan area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can assure Members that, in preparing the
              regional strategic transport network plan, my officials will
              consult the Committee for Regional Development and elected
              representatives, and will screen all single carriageway roads on
              the trunk network to identify those that would benefit most from
              dualling.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is only fair to make it clear that the
              funding for road schemes, or any other element of the regional
              transportation strategy, is not unlimited. I have already proposed
              significant increased investment over the 10-year period of an
              additional £1·37 billion. If it is determined on the basis of
              analysis and other considerations that any particular route should
              be improved over and above the illustrative proposals in the
              regional transportation strategy, it stands to reason that other
              schemes in the illustrative proposal would have to be withdrawn,
              or additional funds would have to be found. That is the difficult
              balance that my officials and I will have to strike.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The single most critical factor in delivering
              the regional transportation strategy, whether it is for strategic
              highway improvements, or for better bus services or railways, will
              be the availability of the significantly increased levels of
              investment. Therefore I welcome Members’ support for the
              strategy, and for individual schemes. I hope that that strong
              support across the House will result in my Department’s being
              allocated the necessary funding increase in future Budget rounds,
              whether from normal public expenditure, the reinvestment and
              reform initiative, or the underwriting of payments related to
              public-private partnerships. I trust that the investments that I
              have mentioned for the road network in west Tyrone illustrate my
              Department’s ongoing commitment to that area in particular, and
              that the regional transportation strategy, if fully funded, is the
              way forward for Northern Ireland in general.</p>
