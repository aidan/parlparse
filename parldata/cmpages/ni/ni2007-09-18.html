		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I want to deal with a point of order. At the start of yesterday&rsquo;s business, Mr  Gregory Campbell raised a point of order regarding the Hansard report of last  Tuesday&rsquo;s debate on attacks on Orange Halls. Mr Campbell said that although he  made a remark, which could be clearly heard, during the speech of the junior  Minister Mr Kelly, it was not reported in Hansard.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">I have reviewed the  relevant section of last Tuesda</span>y&rsquo;s proceedings. It is clear that Mr  Campbell did indeed make a remark from a sedentary position. It is equally  clear that the junior Minister Mr Kelly did not respond or refer to the remark.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members should be aware, the convention is that Hansard reports remarks made from a sedentary  position <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">only if they are referred to  by another Member or, i</span>ndeed, the Speaker. That point is made clear on  page 117 of the &lsquo;Northern Ireland Assembly  Companion&rsquo;, where it is <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">pointed out  that, on 6 December 1999, the then S</span>peaker stated that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;remarks made from a sedentary position are recorded  into Hansard only if they are referred to by the Member who is on his feet at  the time.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that there was absolutely no reference to Mr Campbell&rsquo;s remarks, which were made from a sedentary  position, Hansard, quite properly, did not record them in the report of that  day&rsquo;s business in the House.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that that clarifies the matter. In addition to the  ruling this morning, I have written to Mr Campbell to further clarify the  point.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading">British-Irish Council</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy  First Minister that the First Minister wishes to make a statement on the  British-Irish Council.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong><span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">The First Minister (Rev Dr Ian Paisley)</span></strong><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">: Mr Speak</span>er, in compliance with section  52C(2) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, we  wish to make the following report on  the ninth summit meeting of the British-Irish Council, which was held here in Parliament Buildings on 16  July 2007. Each Executive member and junior Minister who attended the  meeting has approved the report, which we make on their behalf.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The British-Irish Council is a forum for its members to  exchange information, and to discuss,  consult on and agree, as they see  fit, co-operative measures in areas of mutual interest.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Deputy First Minister and I welcomed the heads of  delegations. We were accompanied by the Minister of Education; the Minister for  Employment and Learning; the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment; the  Minister of the Environment; the Minister of Finance and Personnel; the  Minister for Regional Development; the Minister for Social Development; and the  junior Ministers in Office of the First and the Deputy First Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish and British Government delegations were led by the Taoiseach, Mr Bertie Ahern TD, and the  Prime Minister, the right hon Gordon  Brown MP, respectively. The Welsh Assembly Government were represented  by their Deputy First Minister, Ieuan Wyn Jones, and the Scottish Executive  were represented by their First Minister, the right hon Alex Salmond MP MSP.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bailiwick of Guernsey was represented by its Deputy  Chief Minister, Stuart Falla, and the Bailiwick of Jersey was represented by its Chief Minister, Senator Frank  Walker. The Isle of Man Government were  represented by their Chief Minister, Mr Tony Brown MHK &mdash; that means &ldquo;Member of  the House of Keys&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Council members acknowledged the historic nature of the  meeting, which was the first summit meeting of the Council since the  restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly in May 2007, and the first Council  summit to take place in Northern    Ireland. It was also the first occasion on which the eight heads of the Administrations  had had the opportunity to meet since recent elections in many of their  territories.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If I may take the opportunity, Mr Speaker, I wish to thank you and your staff, on the Deputy First Minister&rsquo;s  behalf and my own, for making the splendid facilities of this Building  available for the meeting. We received numerous appreciative comments from the  other participants about the hospitality that they received.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As for what was achieved, the Council reviewed and  discussed how it might develop its work, now that all eight members are again  properly represented by their respective Administrations. Recognising the Council&rsquo;s potential to strengthen relations and  to develop co-operation further among its members across a range of sectors of mutual interest and benefit, members  agreed that it was now opportune to review the Council&rsquo;s future  direction. In that context, Scotland  proposed energy as a useful work area for  the Council to explore, and offered to lead on the issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council tasked its  secretariat, in consultation with the  member Administrations, with undertaking a strategic review of the  Council&rsquo;s work programmes, working methods and support arrangements, including  arrange&shy;ments for a standing secretariat. The secretariat will report back with  firm proposals as soon as possible.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On specific issues, we lead the work of the Council in the transport sector. In that regard, heads of  Adminis&shy;trations discussed the  current and future state of transport infrastructure links. They  recognised that the provision of well-planned  infrastructure is critical to the economic and social development of  these islands, and that this is particularly the case with transport. Fast,  efficient and integrated transport links are important for all the member  Administrations to enable the movement of people and goods and the further  promotion of invest&shy;ment, trade and tourism between them and the rest of the  world.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council, therefore, agreed to examine the potential for  further co-operation and collaboration on transport planning and investment to  strengthen further the integration of transport networks across its boundaries  and transport modes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council also noted the agreement by Scotland and Northern Ireland to examine the  case for restoring ferry links between Campbeltown and Ballycastle.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council concluded that it should continue to build on  the valuable progress made in road safety, including a more consistent approach  to driver disqualification and lesser offences, and in sharing best practice on  sustainable travel and mobility.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish Government are leading the Council&rsquo;s work on the  misuse of drugs. At its last ministerial meeting in December 2006, the Council  focused on the challenges presented by cocaine use. Ministers found that each  Administration is facing similar issues, and that the problem is at various  stages of development in the different  jurisdictions. Ministers resolved to continue to co-operate and exchange  experience, with particular emphasis on initiatives that have led to successful  outcomes and that may lend themselves to broader application in other  Administrations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The environment sector  is led by the British Govern&shy;ment and was the focus of the summit held  in London in  June 2006. At that summit, the focus was on climate change, including work on  understanding the impact of unavoidable  climate change and on developing adap&shy;tation strategies. The Council  continues to intensify co-operation and the exchange of information between  members on this and other important areas, including <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">understanding extreme weather events, integrated coastal</span>-zone  management and managing radioactive waste.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Isle of Man Government  are leading work on e-health, which is the remote diagnosis and treatment of  patients through the use of telecommunications technology. Work continues on  technical issues, such as common technical standards, a relevant clinical  governance framework, protocols for the secure exchange of confidential data,  and quality standards for e-health on the Internet.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council is also examining legal, regulatory and ethical  issues in the e-health sector. These issues have come to the fore recently and  will require firm guidelines to allow the sector to continue its current rapid  development.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bailiwick of Guernsey is taking the lead on the Council&rsquo;s tourism work sector. That sector has  completed several projects, including a model to measure the economic  impact of tourism in the regions and training programmes for staff who work in  the sector. A review of the future work and direction of that group will be  carried out by the date of the next ministerial meeting in the sector.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bailiwick of Jersey is  taking the lead on the Council&rsquo;s work on the knowledge economy. Work is under  way to enhance business continuity planning among  small businesses that may be affected by serious threats such as  terrorist incidents. Possible preventative measures and business continuity  planning are being developed to strengthen business sustainability. An  assessment of the readiness of small, medium- and micro-sized businesses has  been carried out, and a common set of best-practice guidelines on preventative  measures and business continuity planning is being developed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Welsh Assembly Government are taking the lead in the  indigenous, minority and lesser-used languages work sector. The most recent  ministerial meeting in October 2006 focused on three areas: language  transmission in the family; adult education; and  information and communications technology (ICT).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Language transmission in the family is recognised as being  vital to the process of maintaining a language. Ministers endorsed further work  in that area to explore how best to support  language transmission in the family, how models could be transferred to  other languages, identifying gaps in knowledge and how British-Irish Council  Adminis&shy;trations could work together to fill those gaps.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers agreed that,  although the approach adopted and the support for adult education  provision would vary from one Administration to another, there were valuable  opportunities to be gained by continuing to share and exchange experiences in  that area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The indigenous, minority and lesser-used languages group  continues to advance work in those areas. It is also working on two new areas:  planning and linguistic considerations; and research, data and language-use  surveys.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Scottish Executive and the Welsh Assembly Government are jointly taking the lead on the  Council&rsquo;s work on social inclusion. That group is now examining child  poverty, with a focus on lone parents. The work is focused on transition points  in people&rsquo;s lives and the proper provision  of support at those times. The British-Irish Council is also examining  how Administrations identify, and take  account of, the views of parents, young people and children when  formulating their policies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Demography is the newest work sector, and it is led by the  Scottish Executive. The group has recently commenced work and has agreed to  focus its efforts on migration, which has a broad and varied impact on the  eight members. I am glad to say that the Minister for Employment and Learning  is representing the Northern Ireland Executive&rsquo;s interests in that sector.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, Mr Speaker, I can report that the next British-Irish Council summit meeting will  be held in late 2007 and will be hosted by Ireland at a venue to be announced.  I think that I should add: here endeth the first lesson.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and the Deputy First Minister <strong>(Mr Kennedy)</strong>: I welcome the First Minister&rsquo;s statement  on the British-Irish Council summit meeting that took place on 16 July 2007.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">However, I am concerned that,  although the meeting took place on 16 July, during the summer recess, the  statement has been made only today, instead of at the Assembly&rsquo;s first  opportunity, last week. The system appears  to have been subject to some delay and slippage.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have a number of questions. Will the First Minister  indicate a more precise timescale for the formation of a standing secretariat  for the British-Irish Council?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I note that the British-Irish Council is examining the  issue of child poverty. That matter is of particular interest to the Committee  for the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, which will  be considering terms of reference for an inquiry into child poverty at its next  meeting. I ask the First Minister to state when we can expect a report on child  poverty from the British-Irish  Council. If a full report will not be available for some time &mdash; as is  likely &mdash; will the First Minister share the findings of the British-Irish Council with the Committee  on a regular and ongoing basis?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the First Minister to detail the mechanisms that are  in place to communicate and engage with the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and other Assembly Committees  before and after meetings of the British-Irish Council to enable those  Committees to uphold their statutory scrutiny functions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I wish to ask  a question in a personal capacity, on  behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party. The First Minister will be aware of  the recently declared intention of the governing party in the Irish Republic  &mdash; Fianna F&aacute;il &mdash; to organise politically in Northern Ireland. Will the First  Minister indicate whether he was consulted in advance  of that development by Mr Ahern, and will he &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member must take his seat. I try to give Chairpersons of Committees as much  latitude as possible when asking questions on ministerial statements, but those  questions must relate to the statements. The Member&rsquo;s last question does not,  in any way, relate to the First Minister&rsquo;s statement. That is my ruling.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: This is the first opportunity to make the statement to the House  because it first had to go before the Executive. The Executive must see and  approve statements that are a matter for the whole House. That is what we did,  and there was no slippage whatsoever, except the slippage of the Member in not  knowing that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As for the politics of another country, that is no concern of mine. I will defend our right to have  our own political parties, which will do the job that the people of Northern Ireland  want them to do. Perhaps I am speaking out of turn, but I want to put that on  record.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked about a standing secretariat for the British-Irish Council. We are taking up  work that has been the subject of previous consultation. I remind the Member  that the St Andrews Agreement states:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Following  consultation with its other members, and with a view to giving further impetus  to its work, the two Governments would facilitate  the establishment of a standing secretariat for the British-Irish  Council, if members agree.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The strategic review will examine the arrangements for a  standing secretariat. The Council members have agreed on that matter, and that  process is under way. I trust that that process will be speedy because the  Council deserves such a standing secretariat to address the very large agenda  with which it must deal.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Recommendations and outcomes that arise from the review will be subject to agreement by all the  Adminis&shy;trations concerned.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I will write to the Member and bring him up to date  on the other matters that he mentioned.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank the First Minister for bringing the report to the Assembly. I should like  to add to what Mr Kennedy said about the mechanisms whereby his Committee and  the other Assembly Committees can feed into the agenda of the British-Irish  Council and scrutinise issues on that agenda at an early stage. For example, it  will be important for Members to receive feedback on child poverty as we are  seeking to carry out an investigation into the matter. If an arrangement could  be facilitated, it would be most welcome.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to raise two issues. First, the First Minister said that Northern Ireland is taking the lead  on transport. Will he clarify whether real connectivity between the Republic of Ireland  and Northern Ireland  will be on the agenda? Clearly, transport is of strategic importance across the  island, but it is particularly important to Northern Ireland as regards  connectivity with its closest neighbour.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, sustainability is the responsibility of the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister,  and a co-ordinated approach to sustainability would be welcomed in these  islands. I am interested to know whether the First Minister will state whether  he will be putting sustainability on the agenda of future British-Irish Council  meetings.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The answer to the hon Lady&rsquo;s first point is yes; we are taking  the lead on transport. The British-Irish  Council agreed to examine the potential for further co-operation and  collaboration on transport planning and investment to strengthen further the integration of transport networks across its  boundaries and transport modes. As that work will include all member  countries, it is quite clear that we are looking for an integrated transport  system that will link all the countries concerned.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There will be a meeting in the spring to consider the first  steps that will be taken to eradicate child poverty. As regards the involvement  of Assembly Committees in the work of the British-Irish Council &mdash; an issue that  I did not respond to when answering the questions put by the previous Member  who spoke &mdash; my answer would be yes. I am sure that we would all want the fullest possible agreement on those  matters, and the usual channels can be used when meetings of the  British-Irish Council are being arranged.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Knowing the Council&rsquo;s work programme, as regards the items  that are essential to our meetings here, it would be impossible to consult with  every Assembly Committee.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  My interest is in tourism and the economic impact for the Giant&rsquo;s   Causeway area. Will the First Minister state what progress has  been made to reinstate the ferry service between Ballycastle and Campbeltown?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Officials from Northern    Ireland and the Scottish Executive held a  video conference on Friday 20 July 2007. The principal outcomes of that  conference were as follows: all previous work &mdash; the business case, transport  appraisals and the current tendering  exercises &mdash; needs to be revisited as soon as sufficient time has elapsed from the project commenced and the  current position came into play.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Scottish Executive, with whom we have been in touch,  will develop new terms of reference for a fresh economic transport appraisal and timetable for delivery. A steering group, on which the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment will be represented, will be created as  agreed in the terms of reference, and will manage the review process.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am personally in constant touch with the First Minister  of Scotland, and he is, of course, enthusiastic that the project should be completed  and the service reinstated. It is also possible that the service could continue  further along the Scottish coastline than had been intended in the first  proposition.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the First Minister for his  statement. I welcome the fact that the environment has been highlighted as an  important issue and that there has been agreement to intensify co-operation and  exchange of information. Given that this work sector is being led by the  British Government, is it possible that the BIC will examine serious concerns across the island of Irela<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; ">nd</span> about Sellafield and the management of radioactive  waste? Furthermore, will the First Minister agree that a roll-out of nuclear  power stations across the water will have serious implications for the island of Ireland?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The BIC has no regulatory role in respect of Sellafield.  Regulatory responsibility rests with HM Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and  the Environment Agency. However, I am sure that the BIC will take an interest  in those matters, which affect all of us.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  thank the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister for presenting today&rsquo;s  report on behalf of the Executive. Like  other Members, I welcome the fact that the BIC meeting took place. I  note that, in the &ldquo;family photograph&rdquo; of  the leaders of the delegations on 16 July 2007, there was only one  Englishman &mdash; who happened to be a  natural-born Tory named Shaun. People would not have predicted that a  number of years ago.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">More importantly, the British-Irish Council, as the First  Minister reflected in the report, allows Adminis&shy;trations to share experiences  and challenges in quite a number of areas. The subject matters on which the  different member Administrations are leading were established in the last  period of devolution. I am glad to see that those areas have stood the test of  time and that the work is continuing.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the emphasis that is now going to be applied to child  poverty mean that the previously published Northern Ireland anti-poverty  strategy will be re-examined and reconditioned in light of the BIC work that is  being carried out on social inclusion?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I remind the First Minister that the proposal for a  standing secretariat was first made back in 2001 and 2002. I hope that the  permanent secretariat will not only service  the meetings of the eight Administrations, but will have a specific role  of encouraging and monitoring bilateral and multilateral engagement by the  member Administrations &mdash; all eight of them do not need to work together on  everything or to meet at the one time.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, I encourage  the First Minister and his colleagues to support the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s  proposal that the British-Irish Council should examine energy and the overlap  between energy and the environment. Obligations regarding renewable energy sources need to be examined at BIC level,  because the Whitehall Department has proposed significant changes that  could have implications for us and the wider islands, vis-&agrave;-vis the single  electricity market.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I thank the hon Gentleman for his remarks. The review that is  commencing will take in the broad sweep of issues that he mentioned. The BIC  will return to the matters that have already been discussed and will pursue  them in order to find a way forward. I shall write to the Member about some of those matters and assure him that they are on the  agenda. I cannot, of course, say what the decisions might be.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Will the First Minister ensure that the British-Irish Council is not merely a  talking shop, and will he give an example of practical co-operation?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First Minister</strong>: The recent summit demonstrated the  commitment of members to develop practical co-operation  and arrangements that can make a meaning&shy;ful impact on people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The British-Irish Council is most certainly not just a  talking shop; it is an extremely valuable forum in which vital aspects of  policy in a wide range of sectors are discussed. It is also valuable for  ensuring that we in Northern Ireland  are aware of, and can share, best practice with our BIC partners and with  others across Europe. We want to see more  tangible evidence of the impact of that  co-operation, and the review will examine how that can be achieved. We  also look forward to engaging with the other Administrations in deciding how to  make best use of the body, which is unique in Europe.  Together with the other institutions, the BIC can  have a powerful role in making life better for us all.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. One of the areas of practical  co-operation that the BIC has concentrated on is the issue of drugs misuse. I welcome the First Minister&rsquo;s comments  about that. I also welcome the programme of work that has been set out,  particularly the training and employment for  recovering drug misusers and the formal and informal education for young  people. Will the First Minister outline any further areas of co-operation in  relation to this most serious issue?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The BIC secretariat, in consult&shy;ation with member  Administrations, has developed certain programmes on matters such as transport,  the misuse of drugs, the environment, and language. The review will address  those issues, and decisions will be made on them. I will keep in mind the  Member&rsquo;s comments about his interest in the  issue of the misuse of drugs, and I will probably be able to write to  him more fully when the review commences. However, I assure him that that  matter will certainly be on the agenda.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: What plans are there to develop the work and the future  direction of the British-Irish Council?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: That will depend on the review, on which, of course, we all have  to agree. Therefore, if we agree, the BIC will move forward, and if we make no  such agreements, it will not move; it really depends on ourselves. However,  there is plenty of basis for agreement in  many of the areas that have been discussed.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his report on the British-Irish Council meeting.  I also note the participation of high-level delegates from each of the areas.  My question relates to the possibility that the Province should receive a  financial package, mention of which was absent from the report. Given that the Rt  Hon Gordon Brown, Prime Minister of the United   Kingdom, was present at the meeting, were there any  discussions about a special economic package for Northern Ireland?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The BIC talks were not about the personal relationships that  exist within the United    Kingdom. We certainly took the opportunity  to probe the Prime Minister as best we could, but his mind was on other  matters. The BIC is not a forum in which we extract what we want from the  British Government: it is a forum in which, along with other parts of this  area, we face up to matters of common interest on which we can all work  together if we so desire.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  also thank the First Minister for his report, and I welcome the substantial  workload with which the BIC is proceeding.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I note the First Minister&rsquo;s answer to Mr Hilditch on the  Campbeltown-Ballycastle ferry service. At the time of the press announcement, there was specific reference to extending the route to Troon. Given that he represents  North Antrim, I know that the First Minister  will be as keen as I am to ensure that the project comes about. Is the  extension of the service to Troon a significant part of the thinking behind the  project?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">More broadly, given that  the project failed previously because the private sector was not willing  to become involved, are other specific  incentives being considered to encourage that sector to do so?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First Minister</strong>: I welcome the hon Gentleman&rsquo;s comments.  Reinstatement of the service is really a Scottish matter, and without breaking  any confidences, I can tell him that the First Minister of Scotland has been  giving it a sympathetic hearing. Our  Scottish brethren are discussing the matter, and I trust that they will  soon give us some answers in order that we can proceed. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some fellow Members did not like the word &ldquo;brethren&rdquo;; they can call them sheep, goats or whatever  they like, but I look upon them as sheep.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  thank the First Minister for his compre&shy;hensive  statement, and I welcome the fact that east-west relations are being  strengthened. Will the First Minister inform the House what the cost of hosting  the British-Irish Council summit was to Northern Ireland?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First Minister</strong>: As hosts of the summit, Northern Ireland bore the cost, which was in the region of &pound;21,000.  Without exaggeration, for that price, we got a good deal as far as publicity  was concerned. The effect of that will be that people will look more closely at  Northern Ireland  and will hopefully bring into our Province those higher-paid jobs that we all  know are sorely needed.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I congratulate the First Minister on the report. What work is being undertaken  to increase east-west activity to make it on a par with North/South arrangements?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: At last there is agreement that both east-west and North/South  co-operation will be equal in our political fields. Neither North/South nor  east-west co-operation will take precedence; they will run at the same velocity  and will take on board the questions that each needs to discuss and answer.</p>
		    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Ch&eacute;ad-Aire as an tuairisc  shuimi&uacute;il chuimsitheach at&aacute; s&eacute; i ndiaidh a chur os comhair an Tion&oacute;il. Chuir m&eacute;  suim ar leith sa chuid sin den tuairisc a bhain le mionteangacha d&uacute;chasacha,  agus baineann mo cheist f&eacute;in leis an ghn&eacute; sin den obair.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the First Minister for the comprehensive and  interesting report that he has delivered to the House. I was particularly  interested in that part of the report that deals with minority and indigenous  languages. Will the Office of the First  Minister and the Deputy First Minister consider  proposing to its British-Irish Council colleagues the use of immersion  in indigenous languages as an educational tool? The aim of that would be to  share research, aid development, and exchange experiences between Ireland, North and South; Scotland; the Isle of Man; and Wales. Go raibh  m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I can reply to the second part of the hon Member&rsquo;s question. I  was not at Pentecost, so I do not have the gift of interpreting languages.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The National Assembly for Wales is taking the lead in the  indigenous, minority and lesser-used languages group. Its representatives will  set up the necessary arrangements, but we will make an input. If any country  has had a problem with language, it has been Wales. Therefore, the Welsh know  what obstacles to look out for, and they  have learned, through experience, how to deal with them. I am sure that  the Welsh delegates are the best people to  lead this group. However, we will have the right to put our views to  them, and I am sure that the hon Gentleman will ensure that his views are  heard.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  What benefits will be derived from the British-Irish Council?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: There is potential for many helpful improvements to be made. I am  particularly worried about the large number of deaths on our roads, and that  point was brought out firmly at the BIC meeting on 16 July.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All countries and places involved in the BIC need to have a  proper disqualification law, because there are many people using our roads who  are unaccustomed to them. A young man who attended  my church was killed recently by a  driver who had arrived in Northern Ireland from another country in Europe  only a few days previously. The driver had only a provisional licence. He drove  into the car that my friend was in, and my friend was killed. That accident brought the  seriousness of the situation home to me. In that area alone, we could  make progress. However, there are other areas on which we will have to wait and  see. I am biased, of course, but North Antrim ought to have back its ferry service  to Scotland.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Will the First Minister inform the House when the review into the workings of  the Council will be undertaken?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The review is the responsibility of the participating  Administrations. We will press for the review to be completed and will report  back with firm proposals as soon as possible. I understand that the review will  begin in a few days&rsquo; time.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Will the First Minister inform the House what progress has been made on the  mutual recognition of driving disqualifications between the United Kingdom and  the Republic of Ireland?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I would like to see a good relationship between both parts of  this island without any political claims of jurisdiction by either one. We are  not claiming that the South of Ireland should be part of the United Kingdom, and they should not claim that we should be part of the Irish Republic.  That should be borne in mind. This is not a place for arguing  constitutional positions: it is a place for arguing for the best arrangements  for the ordinary people who can benefit from them.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I welcome the First Minister&rsquo;s report. A priority work area for the  British-Irish Council in its former manifest&shy;ation was the Irish Sea, and lead  responsibility on that &mdash; as I understand it &mdash; was to be with the Isle of Man and Irish Governments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the First Minister check that the priority area of the Irish Sea is  still part of the programme of work of the BIC, given his comments on  the environment and the nuclear industry and following the comments from my  colleague in Sinn F&eacute;in?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the First Minister  consider introducing affordable housing and suicide prevention to the  work programme of the BIC? Both issues are of concern to Members, and I am sure  that a lot can be learned from BIC members  about how they are addressing the issues.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, will the First Minister, given his well-made  comments on traffic offences, comment further on driver disqualification and lesser offences? His colleague, the Deputy First Minister, may have  some information that would be useful for the Assembly to hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I will keep in mind what the hon Member has said, and I will  enquire of the BIC whether those items can be included in the review.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A question was asked about the mutual recognition of driving disqualifications between the United Kingdom and other parts of these islands. As far as the UK, and Northern and Southern Ireland are  concerned, there is an  intergovernmental commitment between the UK  and Ireland  to co-operate as soon as possible in recognising each other&rsquo;s driving  disqualifications. We will have to wait  until that comes, and I have been told that there will have to be  subordinate legislation if it is recommended. Officials  in the United Kingdom and Ireland are working  closely to initiate mutual recognition of driving disqualifications as soon as  is practicable. I hope that my answer will help the hon Member.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That concludes questions on the First Minister&rsquo;s statement.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Office of the First Minister and  the Deputy First Minister that the Deputy First Minister wishes to make a  statement on the North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC). I call the Deputy  First Minister, Mr Martin McGuinness.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister (Mr M McGuinness)</strong>: A LeasCheann Comhairle, I wish to make a  statement on the fifth plenary meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council,  which was held in the Armagh City Hotel, Armagh,  on 17 July, 2007.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All the Executive  Ministers who attended the meeting have  approved the statement, and I am presenting it on their behalf. The  Executive delegation was led by the First  Minister and me, and we jointly chaired the meeting.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the First Minister and myself, our  delegation comprised the Minister of Finance and Personnel; the Minister of the Environment; the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure; the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment; the Minister for Regional Development; the Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development; the Minister of Education; the Minister for  Employment and Learning; the Minister for Social Development; and the junior  Ministers in OFMDFM.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish Government delegation was led by the Taoiseach,  Bertie Ahern, and comprised the T&aacute;inaiste and  Minister for Finance, Brian Cowen TD; the Minister for Transport and the  Marine, Noel Dempsey TD; the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dermot Ahern TD; the  Minister for Enterprise, Trade and  Employment, Miche&aacute;l Martin TD; the Minister for Arts, Sport, and  Tourism, S&eacute;amus Brennan TD; the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht  Affairs, &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v; the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Mary  Coughlan TD; the Minister for Education and Science, Mary Hanafin TD; the  Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, John Gormley TD;  and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Eamon Ryan  TD.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All Ministers acknowledged the significance of the occasion  &mdash; the first meeting of the NSMC in plenary sitting since 2002. They welcomed  the opportunity to meet on the North/South Ministerial Council to consult on  and promote mutually beneficial co-operation and take a number of decisions on  a range of issues in the Council&rsquo;s work programme.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to infrastructural matters, the Council noted the Irish Government&rsquo;s intention to make  available a contribution of &pound;400 million &mdash; &euro;580 million &mdash; to help fund  major roads programmes to provide dual-carriageway  standard on routes in the North serving the north-west gateway and the  eastern-seaboard corridor from Belfast to Larne. The Executive confirmed their  acceptance, in principle, to take forward those two major road projects, and the Council noted that the road project  from Belfast to  Larne would be taken forward by the Executive and their agencies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The North/South Ministerial Council agreed that the route  serving the north-west gateway will be taken forward  in line with funding and accountability, planning, management and  delivery arrangements agreed between the Irish Govern&shy;ment and the Executive.  It was agreed that the relevant Ministers would take the necessary steps to  progress that project, including the early commencement of a route corridor  study.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council agreed to proceed with the restoration of the  section of the Ulster   Canal between Clones and Upper Lough Erne in the light of the Irish Government&rsquo;s  offer to cover the full capital costs of the project. In line with the relevant  legislation, Waterways Ireland, a North/South implementation body, will be  responsible for the necessary restoration work and, following restoration, for  its management, maintenance and development &mdash; principally for recreational purposes.  It was agreed that relevant Ministers meeting in the NSMC inland waterways  sector would agree plans to take forward that restoration work, including  details of funding arrangements, and would report on progress to the NSMC  plenary meetings.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council received a  report from the joint secre&shy;taries on the work of the NSMC since 2002.  It noted that the work of the North/South  implementation bodies and Tourism Ireland had continued, and  expressed its appreciation to the boards  and staff for their contribution.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council also noted the mutually beneficial co-operation  taken forward between Ministers and Departments in the areas for co-operation.  The Council agreed to take forward the review provided for in the St Andrews  Agreement of the North/South implement&shy;ation bodies and areas for co-operation.  The review will commence in September 2007, and a final report will be  presented to the first NSMC plenary meeting in 2008. The review will be  undertaken by a group including senior officials and an advisory panel of four  expert advisers, two to be nominated by the Executive and two by the Irish  Government. The Council noted that the Irish Government would consult their  social partners in relation to the North/South consultative forum. It also  noted the review of arrangements for consulting civic society here and agreed  to consider the matter on completion of that review.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the provisions of the St Andrews  Agreement relating to the North/South parliamentary forum. It recognised that  any development of a joint parliamentary  forum was a matter for the Assembly and the Oireachtas. Officials from  the two Administrations were charged with making contact with the Assembly and  the Houses of the Oireachtas, and with reporting back to the NSMC at the earliest  opportunity on the prospects for the development of such a forum. The Council  considered and approved a schedule of NSMC meetings to take place over the  coming months and agreed that its next meeting in plenary format would be held  in Dundalk towards the end of the year. Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and Deputy First Minister (Mr <strong>Kennedy)</strong>: As Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First  Minister, I welcome the statement  made on the meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council that took  place on 17 July 2007. Will the Deputy First Minister detail the mechanisms in  place to communicate and engage with the Committee for the Office of the First  Minister and the Deputy First Minister and other Assembly Committees, both  before sectoral and other summit meetings of the North/South Ministerial  Council and afterwards, to enable the Committees to uphold their statutory  scrutiny functions? Will the Deputy First Minister confirm who the Northern  Ireland Executive intend to nominate to participate in the advisory panel to  take forward the review of the North/South implementation bodies, and the areas  for co-operation?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Wearing my party-political hat, I ask the Deputy First  Minister to provide details of how the North/South consultative forum will  operate, outlining its remit and the timescales that will be involved. What  preparatory work has been carried out on the proposed North/South parliamentary  forum?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I almost said paramilitary forum then. <em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will he confirm whether officials have commenced work on that body? To whom will those officials  report?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Deputy First Minister said that the North/South Ministerial Council considered and approved a schedule  of meetings for the coming months. Will Members have access to that schedule,  and will it be published and available in the Assembly Library?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: Each Committee will consider matters that are relevant to their  respective Department. Likewise, on policies on which the Office of the First  Minister and the Deputy First Minister is  designated to lead, we will engage with the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and Deputy First Minister.  The Assembly will be advised of the agenda and attendance list of every  NSMC meeting prior to its beginning. Following each meeting, the relevant Ministers will make a full report to the  Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The North/South Ministerial Council agreed that a group  comprising senior officials drawn from both Administrations and an advisory  panel of four expert advisers will undertake a review and report on it to the  Council. Two members of the panel will be nominated by the Executive and two by  the Irish Government. The First Minister and I are currently considering that  issue, and we understand its urgency.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The NSMC joint secretariat will, of course, support the  review group&rsquo;s work, which, it has been agreed, will commence in September  2007. A final report will be presented to the first NSMC plenary meeting in  2008. However, interim reports may be presented to the NSMC as the review  progresses.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The review will objectively examine the efficiency and value for money of existing implementation  bodies. It will also consider the case for establishing additional bodies to deal with areas of mutually beneficial  co-oper&shy;ation within the existing NSMC framework. The review  will not affect the work of existing  North/South bodies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At its plenary meeting in June 2002, the NSMC agreed to the establishment of an  independent North/South consultative forum. Since then, several changes have  taken place in the North. We have agreed that a review will be conducted to  examine the arrangements for consulting civic society here. We will await the  outcome of that review and consider the impact that that might have on the  establishment of a North/South consultative forum. We do not wish to pre-empt  the outcome of that review; therefore, the North/South consultative forum will  be considered after the review has been completed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We should remember that the Civic Forum was originally  established as a consultative mechanism on social,  economic, and cultural issues. The First Minister and I have agreed that things in the North have  changed significantly since then. Many new people have come to live  among us, so there is a need to review the Civic Forum. Therefore, we have commissioned a fresh review to examine  fundamentally the structure, membership and role of the Civic Forum and to  consider the most appropriate arrangements  for engaging with civic society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At the NSMC plenary  meeting in Armagh, the Council noted  those provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and the St Andrews Agreement that  relate to the North/South parliamentary forum. The Council recognised that any  development of such a joint forum is a matter for the Assembly and the Houses  of the Oireachtas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It was agreed that officials from the two Adminis&shy;trations  would contact the Assembly and the Houses of the Oireachtas on the prospects for  developing such a forum and would report  back to the NSMC at the earliest opportunity.  Officials have now written to the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am more than willing to place the outline schedule in the  Assembly Library.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank the Deputy First Minister for his report. All Members are relieved that  the British-Irish Council and the North/South Ministerial Council are up  and running. We hope that the Assembly&rsquo;s  relationship with both bodies will  be productive for Northern    Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I raised the issue of infrastructure with the First  Minister. I note that expansion of the roads programme was discussed, as were  waterways. One issue, which I am sure is quite dear to the hearts of both the  First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, is that of the rail link to the  north-west, which runs through north Antrim. It seems to be continually under  review and under threat. Will that matter be addressed at future NSMC meetings?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Rail travel is not only a sustainable transport option; it  would provide the north-west with a key gateway. There is also the huge tourism  potential for the island to be considered, and rail links could be extended  into the Republic   of Ireland. Could the  subject of rail links be put on a future agenda of the NSMC?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: Ministers, both North and South, take railways very seriously. We  all know and understand the pressure on our roads, and the Assembly has had  many debates about the contribution that an improved rail system could make to  the quality of everyone&rsquo;s lives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A sectoral meeting on transport was held last Friday in County Fermanagh.  It was attended by Arlene Foster, the  Minister of the Environment; Conor Murphy, the Minister for Regional  Development, and Noel Dempsey, the Minister for Transport in the South. I noted  that they talked about increasing the frequency of the Belfast-Dublin train  service, with the prospect of an hourly service between the two cities. I have  no doubt that that important issue will be the subject of intense discussion in  the NSMC in the near future.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>: I welcome the Deputy First Minister&rsquo;s announcement about the  injection of funds from the Irish Republic into the Northern Ireland economy. However,  many people in Northern    Ireland would say that it is a belated  contribution by a country that harboured those who destroyed our economy for a  long time. Compared to the destruction carried out by IRA units based in the Irish Republic  over the past 30 years, the contribution does not even scratch the tip of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  economic iceberg.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, will the Deputy First Minister tell us how much of the funds that have been allocated will be  made available for upgrading the A8? What contribution is expected from  the Northern Ireland Executive? Is there a time limit in which those funds must  be spent, and is the Deputy First Minister convinced that the Executive will  bring forward proposals to ensure that the funds are spent in that period?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: That matter is the responsibility  of the Minister for Regional Development, Conor Murphy. There can be no  doubt that, as a result of the decisions taken by the NSMC, Ministers are now  charged with the responsibility to proceed and to expedite those matters.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Principally, the responsibility to articulate a view on  that issue lies with the Minister for Regional Develop&shy;ment, who will make a  statement to the House shortly. He will provide a comprehensive report on the  meeting that was held last Friday in County   Fermanagh.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the Deputy First  Minister&rsquo;s report on the North/South Ministerial Council meeting. I also  welcome the Deputy First Minister and the First Minister to Armagh  at any time.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The commitment of the Irish Government to provide &euro;400  million to support the development of roads infrastructure is to be welcomed,  particularly the upgrading of the main arterial route in the north-west, and  that of the M14, A5 and N2. That is something that Sinn F&eacute;in, and, in particular, my colleague Pat Doherty, MP for  West Tyrone, has campaigned for for some considerable time.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Deputy First Minister please outline what progress  has been made in bringing this project &mdash; which is vital to the future of the  entire north-west region &mdash; forward? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: As I reported to the Assembly, the NSMC met in its transport  sectoral format on Friday 14 September 2007, and Ministers discussed arrangements  for taking forward those important roads projects. As I also said, the Minister  for Regional Development, Conor Murphy, will be making a full report on that  meeting to the Assembly in due course.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish Government&rsquo;s contribution, and the Chancellor&rsquo;s  package that was announced on 26 March 2007, will help to fund a major roads  programme to upgrade roads to dual carriageway standard on routes in the North  that serve the north-west gateway and the eastern seaboard from Belfast to  Larne.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those schemes are on two of the five key transport  corridors in the North, as identified in the regional transportation strategy.  Both schemes received positive support from a public consultation process,  which was undertaken last year, on proposals to expand the strategic road  improvement programme.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of the road from Belfast to Larne will be taken forward by the  Executive and their agencies, and that of the north-west gateway will be taken  forward in line with funding and accountability, planning manage&shy;ment, and  delivery arrangements agreed between the Executive  and the Irish Government. The Irish Govern&shy;ment are providing part  funding to improve the road infrastructure  to the north-west gateway, and to the port of Larne. That funding will provide mutual benefits for both  jurisdictions and will assist in opening up the north-west region to further  economic growth and development.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The upgrading of the remainder of the Belfast  to Larne route will improve journey times to the port of Larne.  It normally takes at least six years to progress major works projects through  the statutory procedures concerned with the environment, planning approval and  land acquisition. For a very large project, such as that on the A5 &mdash; that is,  the Aughnacloy/north-west gateway &mdash;  construction could take a further four years. However, officials are  considering alternative delivery arrangements that may shorten those  timescales, and that is something that we  would all very much welcome.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I welcome the Deputy First Minister&rsquo;s report on behalf of his office. It was  particularly thoughtful of the First Minister, after the meeting of the  North/South Ministerial Council, to confirm his agreement to the establishment  of the North/South parliamentary forum &mdash; a matter that was detailed in that  report.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Deputy First Minister confirm that, as far as he  and his office are concerned, it should now be full speed ahead with the  establishment of the North/South parliamentary  forum? Although the establishment of that body is in the gift of the  Assembly and the Oireachtas, it would,  nonetheless, be desirable to see that happening in a period of months.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I noted the Deputy First Minister&rsquo;s comments regarding the  St Andrews Agreement review of North/South implementation bodies. Is he in a  position to confirm who the four experts and advisers might be? I noted that he  said that there are conversations taking place with the First Minister  regarding the matter. However, from recent experience, we know that  conservations about people being appointed to fulfil public duties &mdash; such as  the victims&rsquo; commissioner &mdash; can result in no decision being taken for a long  time. I want a reassurance from the Office  of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister that people will be  appointed, and appointed quickly, and that the review will commence in  September, as has been committed to, even though the SDLP has grave doubts  about the value and validity of such a review.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is particularly welcome that the Irish Government have  offered to cover the full capital costs of the restoration of a section of the Ulster Canal  between Clones and Upper Lough Erne.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Deputy First Minister confirm that there are no hiccups in respect of the Northern Ireland  Executive&rsquo;s and the relevant Ministers&rsquo; acceptance of that money, and  that no issues will be raised over contributions to future maintenance? Difficulties over those issues might impede  this valuable project.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: The Member referred to the comments made by the First Minister in  the aftermath of the North/South  Ministerial Council plenary meeting in Armagh;  all the remarks made by the First Minister were helpful and very much in the  spirit and mood of that important occasion. The North/South parliamentary forum  was discussed. I have attended previous  meetings of the NSMC &mdash; and, indeed, the British-Irish Council &mdash; and this  meeting was important in that there was free-ranging debate and discussion. All the Ministers present contri&shy;buted,  and not just through scripted contributions put before them by civil servants.  There was a valuable and progressive discussion which will hold us all in good  stead as we move forward.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As to the processes that we have to take forward, it was  agreed that officials from the two Administrations would make contact, and I have reported to the Assembly this  morning that that is happening. We will see what progress can be made, but it  will primarily be a matter for the Oireachtas and the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept the importance of making speedy appoint&shy;ments vis-&agrave;-vis the review. The decisions that  need to be taken are eagerly awaited, because it is important work and  we are committed to furthering it with all speed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster   Canal is a matter for  Minister Poots, since it is the responsibility of his Department. A meeting of  the Waterways Ireland sector is planned, and the issue will be taken forward  from that point.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Now that decisions have  been taken on the important infrastructural  projects &mdash; the roads and the canal &mdash; the NSMC understands the need to  expedite all of those matters as quickly as possible.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I noted the reference in the Deputy First  Minister&rsquo;s statement to the North/South consultative forum and the  North/South parliamentary forum. Can he  confirm that the genesis of both those proposed bodies was the Belfast  Agreement, and that any decision on their future is a matter to be decided on  both sides of this Chamber?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: I agree absolutely. It is vital that we get agreement on the work  of the NSMC and all the areas of respons&shy;ibility with which we are charged. All the participants in the NSMC are  presently in that mode. We must move  forward with the recognition that we have a responsibility to heal the  divisions of the past, and to do so in a way that does not threaten the  political views or aspirations of any Member.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I also welcome the Deputy First  Minister&rsquo;s statement. In both the roads infrastructure and the upgrading of the  main arterial route to the north-west, I hope that there will be a specific  benefit to Enniskillen, or perhaps the bypass question in Enniskillen, as the  gateway to the north-west of Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My question is about the Ulster Canal.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been involved in efforts to bring about the restoration of the  Clones to Upper Lough Erne section of the Ulster Canal  for a considerable time. Will the Deputy First Minister outline the next step  in bringing the project to completion and  what further consideration is being given to restore the Ulster Canal,  given its huge potential for the economy and tourism in general?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: I noted the remark about the Enniskillen bypass, but that is not principally  a matter for the NSMC, the First Minister or myself, but rather for the Minster  for Regional Development, Mr Conor Murphy. No doubt Mr McHugh and other Members  from Fermanagh will take the opportunity to have that conversation with him.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish Government have offered to cover the full capital  costs of the restoration of the Clones to Upper Lough Erne section of the Ulster Canal.  In light of that offer, the Executive have agreed to engage with the Irish  Government to progress that restoration and share the ensuing costs of the  restored and reopened section, when it is complete. However, that decision does  not confer any commitment on the Irish Government or the Executive to fund  further restoration of the Ulster   Canal. Both  Administrations will keep the issue under constant review.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Waterways Ireland  will be responsible for restoring the section of the Ulster Canal  between Clones and Upper Lough Erne, and following the restoration, will be  responsible for the management, maintenance and development of that section, principally for recreational  purposes. The relevant Ministers in the NSMC&rsquo;s inland waterways sectoral format  will agree plans for the restoration work, which will include forwarding  details of funding arrangements and progress reports to NSMC plenary meetings.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, when I opened  the Scariff Harbour Festival in County Clare,  I received a tour of the amazing facilities at the canal there, and I saw  first-hand the benefits of having an effective canal system. The restoration  project for the Ulster   Canal will provide mutual  benefits for both jurisdictions. On the basis of the Irish Government&rsquo;s offer, the Executive have agreed to engage  with them on the restoration, and, once completed, in the ensuing shared and  recurrent costs of the restored and reopened section.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There have been many debates about the Ulster Canal  in the House over the years. The former leader of the Ulster Unionist Party,  David Trimble, was an enthusiastic fan of the restoration of the canal. Those  Members who appreciate the benefits of having an effective canal system,  particularly for recreational use and tourism, will understand that it is an  important project. However, the difficulty with all important projects is  having adequate funds to proceed with the speed that most Members would like to  see.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I am sure that the Deputy First Minister is aware of the high  level of concern on this side of the House about religious imbalance in the  staff of Waterways Ireland. Will he assure this side of the House that employment  in Waterways Ireland will be based on merit alone? What actions will he take to  ensure that selection and employment in Waterways Ireland will be based on  applications being considered on merit alone?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: I am speaking for the Office  of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, and I am sure that  the First Minister will agree with me that  nobody is interested in seeing anyone discriminated against because of  his or her religion. As political leaders, we have a duty and a responsibility  to ensure that we move forward on the basis of fairness and equality. All  issues that may arise from the employment levels of religious groupings in any  of the North/South Ministerial Council sectors will be kept under review, not  just by the sectors, but by the NSMC itself.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Deputy First Minister for his report. I have noted that, in his  responses to a few questions on roads infrastructure, he has thrown the matter  back to the Minister for Regional Development. Clearly, however, that matter is  dealt with in the report. Therefore, I must  press him on an issue that Mr McHugh mentioned, namely that of providing  infrastructure finance to the Fermanagh area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the areas that have been referred to, such as  those that surround the north-east gateway and the eastern seaboard, are  important to the infrastructural position of Northern Ireland, County Fermanagh  takes a significant volume of traffic from North and South in both directions,  particularly from Donegal to Dublin and from Sligo to Belfast and Larne, and  vice versa. I am disappointed that the report does not refer to either of those  corridors. Can the Deputy First Minister tell me whether those matters have  been discussed at NSMC level?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: As a frequent traveller through County Fermanagh,  I appreciate that it has difficulties with  regard to roads. However, I must reiterate &mdash; and it is not a cop-out &mdash;  that that is principally a matter for the Minister for Regional Development,  Conor Murphy. Obviously, he works with a limited budget, and does a fine job,  in my opinion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The NSMC&rsquo;s ability to  resolve all the roads problems that exist, whether they are in the North  or the South, is limited. The responsibility of the NSMC is to consult and to  agree on mutually beneficial projects. I readily agree that the infrastructure  of border areas, such as Fermanagh, must be kept under review and account taken  of them by the Council. I have no doubt whatsoever that the people who are  charged with taking forward the Council&rsquo;s work will listen carefully to Mr  Elliott&rsquo;s remarks.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  welcome the statement from the First Minster and the Deputy First Minister.  Members have placed a particular emphasis on infrastructure. Will the Deputy  First Minister tell the House whether consid&shy;eration might be given to a future  approach whereby money that is available from the Irish Government is not  simply used on a project-by-project basis, but that a dedicated North/South  fund could instead be created &mdash; an all-Ireland version of European structural  funds, which would provide a much better context for the type of bids that have  been mentioned in the Chamber to be advanced?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Deputy First  Minister tell the House whether, in the future, the NSMC will be used to  recognise whether the Irish Government&rsquo;s national development plan has unallocated reserves, not only for  infrastructure, but across its other key areas for investment? Perhaps  the NSMC should be used to ensure that the North&rsquo;s structures and spending  systems can mesh better with those of the national development plan in order to  make the most of that money, rather than jockeying on a project-by-project  basis.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Deputy First Minster also tell the House whether  the future work programme of the NSMC might include a return to the study on  obstacles to mobility that it previously commissioned? That study may need to  be updated or, perhaps, an entirely new study may need to be carried out, not  least because of issues that have come to  attention recently; for example, when people who have rightly, properly  and naturally moved across the border to live, they have found that they and service providers are being put in an  invidious position because of the anomalies and absurdities of  cross-border life. If that study were to take place, it would help to improve  service planning and would make people who live and work in border areas much  more comfortable in planning their lives.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First Minister</strong>: I thank the Member for his questions. He  mentioned the Irish Government&rsquo;s national development plan. Through their  interest in contributing to important road projects in the North, the Irish  Government have demonstrated that they are willing  to review continually the work that they and the Assembly will carry out on mutually beneficial projects.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This is an important time for the Assembly. It is making  progress, in that a Programme for Government is being developed. We are also  dealing with the comprehensive spending review and the impact that that will  have. We have a 10-year investment strategy to which large sums of money have  been committed. All of that will decide how we prioritise and make progress on future projects. Therefore, we must  consider seriously Mr Durkan&rsquo;s remarks.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The North/South  Ministerial Council has implemented procedures  under which such matters must be considered. As we move forward, our  attention must turn to how we can make better use of the resources that are  available in order to deal with the difficult matter of ensuring that we begin  work on infrastructure projects that will bring the benefits that all our  people clearly deserve.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Since 2002, work has continued on implementing the  recommendations of the report &lsquo;Study of Obstacles to Mobility&rsquo;. Following  extensive consultation with Departments North and South regarding the report&rsquo;s  50 recommendations, 27 have been implemented, and work is ongoing on 15 of  those that relate mainly to mutuality on  qualifications and pensions. As the Member said, those are complex  issues, and work continues with the  relevant Departments to resolve them. However, the NSMC agreed in June  2002 that no action should be taken on the remaining eight recommendations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A website that is dedicated to providing information on  cross-border mobility is currently being developed, and it will become operational in the autumn. Increased mobility  means that many people live in border areas, North and South. They cross the  border regularly, and that creates particular difficulties for some families.  We all have a duty and responsibility to work together. The Irish Government  and this Executive, through the North/South Ministerial Council, have made a  commit&shy;ment to tackle those issues head-on.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an tuairisc  seo, n&oacute; is maith an rud go bhfuil muid ar an aon bh&oacute;thar amh&aacute;in le ch&eacute;ile agus  ag obair in aon treo le ch&eacute;ile.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Deputy First Minister&rsquo;s statement. I also welcome the renewed focus on removing  obstacles to cross-border mobility, as both the Member for Foyle Mr  Durkan and the Deputy First Minister discussed. It struck me in the past week  that a great deal of work needs to be done on cross-border mobility, not least  on postal services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This week, I was told about a lady in Strabane who has moved  just one mile inside the border to Donegal. Her letters arrive one week late  and are stamped par avion. I would like the NSMC to discuss why that should  happen. Such letters have included a young girl&rsquo;s A-level results.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Deputy First Minister reassure me about the  standard of the North/South Ministerial Council secretariat&rsquo;s accommodation?  Having visited those offices, I have seen they are not fit for purpose. I want  a commitment that suitable office accommodation will be made available without  delay so that those people can be housed  properly and can carry on with their vital work, Go raibh maith agat a  LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: As regards postal services, I am sure that all those charged with  respons&shy;ibility for the NSMC will note the Member&rsquo;s remarks and try to make progress for fear that the Member  might end up on &lsquo;The Stephen Nolan Show&rsquo;, criticising the NSMC over postal services in border areas. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked about  permanent accommodation for the NSMC. As everyone knows, the NSMC joint  secretariat is currently located in temporary accommo&shy;dation in Armagh. That accommodation is considered unsuitable from  both health and safety and operational perspectives. I have visited that  facility down the years, and I was very interested to hear during a visit as  Minister of Education that serious consideration was being given to turning Armagh jail into the NSMC headquarters. I suppose that a  certain Member for East Antrim would think that that might be a good idea,  particularly given this morning&rsquo;s photograph in &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo; of the junior  Minister Mr Kelly behind bars in Crumlin Road jail yesterday.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Did he escape?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First Minister</strong>: I think he did escape, yes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In June 2002, the NSMC asked officials North and South to examine options for permanent accommodation  and to report back in the future. Since then, a business case recommending that  the secretariat lease suitable accommodation has been approved by officials in  both Administrations, subject to political and financial considerations. A  procurement exercise yielded seven expressions of interest; these are under  consideration, and a report will be made to a future NSMC meeting.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  The Waterways Ireland restoration of the Ulster Canal  is a fantastic scheme. However, it looks as if it will benefit only one  constituency, Fermanagh and South Tyrone. That is wonderful for the people  there, of course, and I would not take that away from them. However, what will  be the direct or indirect benefits of that scheme for the rest of the Province?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: It is obvious that the opening of any new section of the Ulster Canal  raises the potential for further  development in this area. There is popular support in the House for as  much progress as possible to be made to  ensure that every area through which the Ulster Canal originally passed  can benefit in terms of recreation, sporting facilities and, not least, tourism. As we all know, there has been a huge  increase in tourism in the North in the last few years. We want to build  on that for the future, but we will be able to do so only if we can provide the facilities that tourists would  like to visit.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As someone who saw the  beginnings of the develop&shy;ment of the canals in the South, particularly  around the Carrick-on-Shannon area of County Leitrim,  I find it incredible to see how much development has taken place. Thirty years  ago, Carrick-on-Shannon had just one or two boats, but today it looks almost  like Monte Carlo.  That is what is ahead of us. Such development will not only make a further  incredible contribution to the success of our tourism industry, but provide  important recreational facilities for our own people. The quicker we can  progress this matter to ensure that we all share in the benefits, the better it  will be for all of us.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently argued  for an increase in the number of North/South implementation bodies and areas of  co-operation. For example, I would like  mental health and suicide prevention to be included. Can the Deputy  First Minister assure this House that the review of the North/South Ministerial  Council will also consider the case for additional all-island bodies and areas  of greater co-operation? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: Obviously, we are all very conscious that that matter lies within  the remit of the review that was authorised by the St Andrews Agreement and  taken up by the NSMC. I have no doubt whatsoever that those who will be  considering these matters will recognise the importance of our all working for  everyone&rsquo;s mutual benefit. The issue of mental health affects everybody living  on the island, as do many other matters.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am as interested as anybody else in the outcome of the  review.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Infrastructure is a matter for the NSMC and not just for the Minister for  Regional Development. Will the Deputy First Minister agree that the proper provision of a Southern relief  road would be of great advantage to the economy, particularly in the  South Down constituency, and would also provide a vital link to the port of  Warrenpoint? We should not, as some people in the Republic were pressing for,  pursue the no-brain idea of a bridge at Narrow Water.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Deputy First Minister also confirm that the new  inter-parliamentary forum has been agreed not only by the two Governments but  by him and his right hon Friend, the First Minister?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: I do not need to refer again  to the issue of the inter-parliamentary forum, except to say that the  First Minister and I always endeavour to get  agreement on how we progress. That is essential, and the First Minister  and I will be sensible about moving that situation forward.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The state of the roads  in South Down is, I am afraid, a matter for the Minister for Regional  Development. However, I accept that because  County Down is a border county, we must  consider the most effective use of the available resources to ensure that we  have a proper roads network. That applies equally to Fermanagh and South Tyrone  and to South Down.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All of those matters will be considered by the Ministers responsible, and any schemes that they  wish to bring forward will be decided upon in plenary sessions of the  NSMC.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  In his statement, the Deputy First Minister said that all Ministers acknow&shy;ledged  the significance of the meeting of the NSMC, given the fact that it was the  first meeting since 2002. It was truly significant, and everybody involved,  including the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and all other parties  should be congratulated on that event; it was of historic importance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us fast-forward to  the situation in which policing and justice are devolved. The Deputy  First Minister will be aware that there is a British-Irish agreement on justice  matters, which involves the exchange of law agency personnel from North to  South and vice versa. Will the Deputy First Minister give an assurance that in the event of devolution  of criminal justice and policing powers, there will be a commitment by the Office of  the First Minister and the Deputy  First Minister to the continuance of that agreement, and that a new  North/South agreement on justice matters will be arrived at so that related  issues can be pursued vigorously in the future?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: Criminal justice and policing matters are currently outside the  remit of the NSMC. There is no doubt that  in the event of the transfer of policing and justice powers to the  Assembly and the Executive, the NSMC, the Executive and the Irish Government  will have to decide how to develop our approach to criminal justice and  policing on the island. That will have to be agreed between the major parties  in the Assembly and, through the Executive, with the Irish Government. All of  the other parties have an interest in the issue, and have contributed immensely  to the debate in recent times. However, my report is solely concerned with the  first meeting of the NSMC since 2002. Criminal justice and policing powers, and  the surrounding issues referred to in the Member&rsquo;s question, were outside the  remit of that meeting, but in speculating about what the future might bring,  those matters will have to be resolved.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister  will have to look afresh at that matter, but it will principally be a matter  for the Executive. The Executive will have to reach agreement and they will  have to agree with the Irish Government on how progress can be made on that  issue.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Criminality on this island does not respect borders of any  description. We all have a duty to work together to defeat criminals on this  island. I have no doubt that if progress is  made on the transfer of policing and justice powers, as suggested in the  St Andrews Agreement, the Irish Government and the Executive will face up to  their responsibilities to ensure that they have the best possible processes to  combat criminality.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Can the Deputy First Minister outline  what steps have been taken to address the  obstacles to mobility across the island of Ireland,  particularly the issue of mutual recognition of qualifications and pensions? Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: In response to the contribution of the Member for Foyle Mr  Durkan, OFMDFM&rsquo;s approach to that matter was made clear. Following extensive  consultations with Government Departments North and South, OFMDFM is moving  forward on the basis of the recommendations that have been made in the report  of the study on obstacles to mobility.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are complex issues to consider. As a result of  working in two jurisdictions, there are important issues in dealing with the mutuality of qualifications,  pensions and many other matters. There has been much contro&shy;versy in the  past few weeks about education in border areas. It must be recognised that such  problems will not be resolved overnight or in one fell swoop, but there is a  commitment to understand the difficulties that individual families have  experienced as a result of relocation, whether to the South or to the North.  The Executive and the Irish Government have a duty to work under the auspices  of the NSMC to try to resolve the difficulties that those families face.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I welcome the joint report of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister,  delivered by the Deputy First Minister. It will no doubt have dawned on the  Minister that the promised money that the Irish Government wish to invest  through their national development plan concentrates on nationalist-majority  areas. One of the Irish Government&rsquo;s parties has now declared those areas as an  obvious electoral target for the future. Can the Minister return a focus on  investment in my constituency of Strangford, and other similar constituencies,  for legitimate funding to offset the money-for-votes funding that the Irish are  putting forward for their declared political interests?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: I do not accept for one minute that the motivation of the Irish  Government is related to seeking votes.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  You are very foolish.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First Minister</strong>: I am not foolish at all; I am very wise in this matter. In the course of the  processes that we have been through in recent times, which led to the  re-establishment of these institutions, people recognised the critical  importance of all of us working together for the mutual benefit of everyone who  lives on the island. That is done without fear or favour.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If there are particular difficulties in Strangford, it is the duty of the Executive to try to resolve those  through our Departments. It is not my view that the reason for the Irish  Government&rsquo;s contribution of huge sums of money to resolve the infrastructural  difficulties in some areas of the North is related to seeking votes in County Donegal.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When one meets people and sees that they have a real  empathy for the North and a wish to contribute in a meaningful way to making  life better for all of us, one recognises that we have a duty and  responsibility to work together. The Member&rsquo;s suggestion of an electoral  motivation is rather silly.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Deputy First Minister for his statement on behalf of OFMDFM. The  Narrow Water bridge project &mdash; and I want my colleague from South Down to listen  carefully &mdash; was included in the Programme  for Government that was announced in June this year and in the  Republic&rsquo;s national development plan announced on 13 January 2007. Louth County  Council was initially allocated almost &euro;400,000 to carry out a feasibility  study in the area. As mentioned earlier, at a meeting last weekend in  Enniskillen, the Republic&rsquo;s Minister for Transport, Noel Dempsey, endorsed the  project. Therefore, I am disappointed that it has been omitted from today&rsquo;s  statement. What is the reason for that omission?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: The House will receive a full report of the transport sectoral  meeting that took place last Friday in County Fermanagh,  which Noel Dempsey, Conor Murphy and Arlene Foster attended. Those of us who  have attended all sorts of important meetings recently have not failed to  notice the contri&shy;butions that various Members of this House have made to that  project.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the priorities are to make progress on the Belfast to Larne road and  the north-west gateway initiative. Any further expansion must be subject to a  decision by the NSMC. Members should wait for the Minister for Regional  Development to present a report to the House in the coming days, after which  the Assembly can further discuss all those matters.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At the end of the day, whatever the Minister reports to the  House, the Narrow Water bridge project has been raised as an issue. It will be  taken forward by agreement &mdash; or not &mdash; and I have no doubt that those who have a  legitimate interest, particularly those who live in the County Down area, will  continue to canvass for that project.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: That concludes questions on the  statement. As Members know, the Business Committee has arranged to meet as soon  as the Assembly suspends for lunch. I  propose, therefore, by leave of the Assembly, to suspend the sitting  until 2.00 pm.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.22 pm.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the  Chair) &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">2.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading">Fuel Poverty</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the  motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10 minutes for the winding-up  speech. All other Members will have five minutes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One amendment has been selected and published on the  Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes to propose  and five minutes for the winding-up speech.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister for Social  Development to review the strategy for the  eradication of fuel poverty, particularly amongst pensioner households  and households with children.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that this subject has been selected for debate  again. Some Members have questioned why my colleague and I have decided to  bring the subject back to the House as it was debated in May 2007. I hope that  my address will make the reasons clear.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will not repeat everything that I said in May, but I must  state that no one should have to choose between food and heat, which can happen. There is clear evidence that a  warm, dry home can improve life expectancy, and, of course, the opposite is  true: a cold, damp home can reduce life expectancy and increase the need for  intervention from the Health Service.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">From a financial  perspective, it is important to invest in eradicating fuel poverty at an  early stage to avoid the future costs that will incur if it goes unaddressed. Apart from the personal issues and terrible circumstances  that some people endure, there are sound financial reasons to right this wrong.  Which of the following would be the best use of taxpayers&rsquo; money: dealing with  fuel poverty by removing energy-inefficient homes  as a one-off cost investment, or dealing with the ill-health consequences of fuel poverty amongst  families, children and older people, which would be an ongoing drain on  the public purse? It is the old story: early intervention is the most effective  way of saving money.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the triggers for the motion was a report which came  to me from Mr Cobain, who is a member of the Committee for Social Development.  Mr Cobain noted a complacent comment from the permanent secretary of the  Department for Social Development, who stated that the Department is on target  to eradicate fuel poverty as set out in  &lsquo;Ending Fuel Poverty: A Strategy for Northern Ireland&rsquo;. In other words,  by 2010, fuel poverty in vulnerable groups such as children and older people  would be eradicated, and by 2016, fuel poverty would be entirely eradicated. I  was astounded, when I heard this. Mr Cobain  asked the permanent secretary to repeat the claim, and he reiterated  that he was confident that the target would be achieved.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that this will be a very difficult task: it is  difficult to identify all those who are in the vulnerable category and  difficult to get assistance to them. It is not  something that anyone should be complacent about. It would be great if  the target were met, but there is a lot of work to be done if it is to be  achieved.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are a number of reasons why it is important to have  this debate again. First, the Assembly has entered a new term, and I want the matter to be fresh in Members&rsquo; minds.  Winter is approaching, and last night, frost was reported in Northern    Ireland for the first time this season.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>: Following on from what the Member said about Mr Cobain, I am  also a member of the Committee for Social  Development. I, too, was shocked by the, admittedly, very commendable  statement that fuel poverty will be eradicated by 2010. After questioning, a  number of Committee members felt that there may be some doubt about how that  could be achieved. Does the Member agree  that, if there is a new strategy, the Minister should explain to the  House what it is, and how fuel poverty will be eradicated by 2010?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention. Indeed, that is the purpose of the  debate: we want to know what has happened since we last debated this motion, to  pick up the pieces and to learn any lessons that members of the Committee or  any other sources have presented to the Department.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, we have now entered the first cold spell of the winter, and it is more meaningful for most  people to talk about this subject  not as we enter summer, but as we enter winter. Our constituents will  face harsh weather.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">More importantly, we are entering the budgetary process. I  was concerned that, as we had debated this motion in May, it might not be fresh  in everyone&rsquo;s mind. I hope, by having the debate once more, to put the matter  on everyone&rsquo;s list of priorities and to raise it where appropriate, so that it  gets the support that it deserves. If it is necessary to have additional  resources to achieve that objective &mdash; and I suspect that it will be necessary &mdash; I hope that those resources will be  available.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Incidentally, I first learned that this debate had been scheduled when I received a phone call from Pat  Austin, director of National Energy Action Northern Ireland. She was  delighted to see the motion on the agenda again. Perhaps those who wish that  this debate would not happen could explain themselves to the charities  concerned.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Ms Austin has also  written to me to say that she has serious concerns that the objectives  of eradicating fuel poverty in vulnerable  households by 2010, and in non-vulnerable households by 2016, will be  missed. Those who work in that area are also concerned.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I had a look at the Department for Social Develop&shy;ment&rsquo;s  website to identify what was happening on this issue. I do not serve on the  Social Development Committee, and have not been following it at that level. I  came across many documents, some of which were very dated. The last motion on  fuel poverty was about reviewing the policy to see what additions were needed  to achieve improvement in the area. I did not find anything particularly new  and refreshing there.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I did note that the Minister had, in the course of the summer, reminded everyone who might have to apply  for winter fuel cash to do so &mdash; which is commendable &mdash; and that there  had been a meeting of the Northern Ireland  Fuel Poverty Advisory Group. I did not, however, see a range of issues  emerging from that meeting to give me confidence that the permanent secretary&rsquo;s  complacency should not be an area of concern.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the course of that meeting, the warm homes scheme was  discussed, as was benefit uptake &mdash; those are very pertinent issues &mdash; and  research into the whole area of the working poor and those on low incomes. That  research is just starting. How long will that research take? How long will it  take to develop policies to address the research? I am still concerned about  the time frame and the complacency of the permanent secretary.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What has actually changed since the Assembly last met to  debate the subject? Has a review of the strategy occurred? Who here believes  that the situations of 100% of those in vulnerable groups will be addressed  before 2010? Will all those entitled to a winter heating allowance receive it? What efforts will be made to trace those who  have not applied? Is there sufficient money in the Department for the  warm homes scheme? When will the insulation and heating systems in all social  housing be brought up to date? I have come across constituents, living in  upstairs flats, who are spending &pound;20 a week on coal to heat their homes. We have to provide appropriate heating systems and insulation in social housing. Is there  suff&shy;icient money in the Department&rsquo;s budget to address that by 2010?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Does the Member agree that there is a generational and cultural resistance to  entering into some of the schemes that have been devised to help people to have  warm homes? That in itself will be a barrier to 100% take-up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  agree with the Member; it is difficult to achieve a 100% take-up in any scheme.  All possible routes must be followed in an effort to encompass everyone who is  entitled to assistance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have explained the  purpose of the motion. I now turn to the amendment, which I believe is  helpful because it states that the elimination of fuel poverty should be given  priority in the Programme for Government. Such a move may create savings in the  health budget in the long term. As such, I find the amendment helpful, and it may assist the Department for Social  Development in achieving some of its  objectives. Therefore, I am happy to accept the amendment, and I hope  that Members will do likewise in an effort to continue the unanimity of the  House on this matter. I hope that Members will advance this issue in the  relevant Committees as we try to get more funding to end fuel poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: Leave out all after &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo; and  insert</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;notes the debate on fuel  poverty which took place on 29<sup>th</sup> May 2007 and the resolution  adopted; and calls on the Executive to prioritise  the elimination of fuel poverty in the forthcoming Programme for  Government.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank my friend the Member for East   Antrim for accepting the thrust of my amendment. The purpose of  the amendment is to ensure that the Executive make a total commitment to the  elimination of fuel poverty in our society. That must be regarded as a top  priority of any Programme for Government. It is very important that the  amendment be accepted by the whole House to send a straight and clear message  to the Executive that the elimination of fuel poverty must be a top priority  for everyone in Northern    Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened carefully to  the Member for East Antrim, who explained the circumstances surrounding the introduction  of the motion. However, I am not absolutely convinced that the arguments that  he advanced are as clear as he has represented them. It seems to me that the  Minister, in her address to the House on 29 May 2007, made it very clear that she was totally committed to the  previous Administration&rsquo;s targets of 2010 for the elimination of fuel  poverty in vulnerable groups, and 2016 for the elimination of fuel poverty in  the rest of our society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not fully  understand the misgivings and concerns that have been presented. I was  going to reiterate what the Minister for Social Development said by referral to  pages 20-21 of the Hansard report of 29 May.  I shall not repeat her words, but  she made very firm commitments. Of course, the Minister is a member of  the Social Democratic and Labour Party, and, as a lifelong social democrat, she  is committed to social democracy and to the elimination of social problems that  affect the most vulnerable in our society. I am certain that the Minister is firmly committed to those social democratic  principles in the pursuit of policy on this matter.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It would be wrong to attempt to repeat all the arguments,  facts and figures that were advanced on 29 May, but it is safe to say that  considerable progress has been made in dealing with the problem, not just by  the current Administration, but by the previous direct rule Ministers. However,  we must guarantee that that approach will continue. I become a little concerned  when I hear rumours about cost-cutting and economies that must be made in the  forthcoming Budget and in the Programme for Government. It is important that,  at least in the area of fuel poverty, funding is ring-fenced. There should be  no reduction in funding to deal with the problem.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We all support the efforts that have been made to introduce  economies and efficiencies in households across Northern Ireland through various  measures such as the warm homes scheme, the work of the Northern Ireland  Housing Executive (NIHE), and the promotion of grants for home improvements.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All those efforts have been important in bringing about  efficiencies in the home, and they are part and parcel of the measures to  tackle fuel inefficiency and fuel poverty.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been progress  in other areas. For example, 97% of homes in Northern Ireland now have some form of central heating. That is a positive development,  and it should continue to be encouraged.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, some people live on poor incomes, and that major  source of fuel poverty must be tackled. The Minister made it clear in several  announcements that she is committed to ensuring that the Social Security Agency  will redouble its efforts to encourage people to take up their rightful benefit  entitlement. One third of those who are entitled to benefits for fuel poverty do not take them up. Were they to do so,  consider the significant impact that that would have on those who suffer  because of low incomes. The Department for Social Department, in its attack on  the problem, which affects communities  throughout Northern Ireland, must continue to encourage uptake of benefit.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department should  carefully scrutinise particular problems; for example, the message of  home energy efficiency has not reached those who live in rural areas, where  isolation means that the problem of fuel poverty is worse than in urban areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, there is a divergence between those who live in  social housing and owner-occupiers. In the social housing sector, there has  been significant and substantial success in assisting tenants to improve their housing conditions. That is to be welcomed and  must be further pursued. However, owner-occupiers &mdash; many of whom are  elderly and without the wherewithal to deal with the problem &mdash; do not keep pace  with those living in social housing, and I emphasise to the Minister that that  gap must be narrowed. I hope that the Department will place even greater  emphasis on that problem.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly has no control over winter fuel payments; they  are under the control of Westminster, and I hope that the Minister will continue to put  pressure on Westminster  to improve the fuel grant. That grant is important in ameliorating the  conditions for many people in Northern Ireland,  and, because of the dispro&shy;portionate decrease in its value, it is wrong  that the grant has remained at &pound;200 since 2000. Over recent years, there has  been an increase of 70% to 100% in fuel prices.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, there is absolutely no justification for the  static winter fuel payment. I hope that the Minister for Social Development,  with the full backing of the Executive, can  take our case to Westminster  and explain that winter fuel payments must be greatly improved.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have one word of caution: because of the current  volatility of international energy prices, we must act carefully. At any stage, price increases could undermine the  substantial work that the Department for Social Development has undertaken, to  which the Minister is forthrightly committed.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Campbell)</strong>: I welcome the motion  and the fact that its proposer has accepted the amend&shy;ment. I hope, and suspect, that such an issue will attract cross-party support. Some Members may make the case  that not much has changed since the  previous debate on fuel poverty on 29 May 2007. Nonetheless, it was an important topic in May, and it is still an  important topic.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will start with the proverbial good news and will get to the bad news later. The proposer of the  amendment, Mr Maginness, has already mentioned the good news: recent  surveys of house conditions indicate that there has been a year-on-year  improvement in the social housing stock. Over the years, I have crossed swords with the NIHE on several issues. However, the NIHE must be commended, because,  over the past 15 to 20 years, the quality of housing stock has improved  significantly. Despite that improvement, there is still some way to go in the  private-rented sector. The fuel poverty strategy, which targets families that  are in need, is having some effect, and the quality of homes is improving,  particularly in the social housing sector.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In recent house conditions surveys, it is unclear whether  there is universality in fuel poverty. A survey covering Belfast  indicates that the level of fuel poverty is quite low: the percentages in west Belfast and east Belfast  are almost identical &mdash; 4&middot;2% in east Belfast and  4% in west Belfast.  Those low levels of fuel poverty are to be welcomed. However, it is likely that  such surveys do not get to the root of the problem, because the household  sample is not wide enough to target those areas where fuel poverty exists. Data  collection must be improved in order to target the areas that are most in need  of help.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Once again, I wish to commend the warm homes scheme. That  scheme is aimed at those in the private-rented sector and homeowners; people  must be in receipt of certain benefits in order to qualify. The Minister  supports that successful scheme. However, because of its very success, and the  fact that Members continue to encourage people to take it up, the Minister may  have to bid for additional funding for the scheme.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, I and, I suspect, the Committee for Social  Development, will gladly support the Minister&rsquo;s bid for additional funding,  because initiatives such as the warm homes scheme will help to alleviate fuel  poverty in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we need to target areas, particularly those in rural parts of Northern Ireland, where although  people know that they are entitled under the scheme, they feel that it  is a form of charity that they do not wish to avail of. We need to dispel that notion. We need to ensure that people are aware of the scheme; know their entitlement;  know that they should apply, and, that if they qualify, that they will receive assistance. In that way, increasing the  amount of money available and ensuring that there is a more widespread  knowledge of the warm homes scheme will help to address fuel poverty. Whether  fuel poverty can be totally eliminated by  2010 &mdash; as indicated a couple of  weeks ago during a meeting of my Committee &mdash; is open to question.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the motion as amended. The  strategy for ending fuel poverty was developed by the Department for Social  Development following a consultation process that took place at the end of  2003. That strategy was stated to be an important element of the policy of  targeting social need, which covers the period up to 2016, with a focus on 2010  as a key date for the eradication of fuel poverty. That is not an attainable  target. As has been mentioned, Alan Shannon, the permanent secretary of the  Department for Social Development, stated that the Department is on target to  meet the 2010 deadline, but I reiterate that it is not attainable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The strategy identifies  the main causes of fuel poverty as low income, poor energy efficiency  and high energy costs. Households whose occupants are particularly vulnerable  to the effects of the cold weather on their health  and social well-being &mdash; and it is worth reminding Members about those  who are directly affected &mdash; contain an elderly person, someone with a  disability or long-term illness, or a family with at least one child under 16.  Approximately 200 older people die here every year from cold-related illnesses,  which is an appalling statistic.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Households headed by older people are much more likely to  be living in fuel poverty; 39% of people aged 60 to 74, and 42% of those aged  75 and over, are more likely to be suffering from fuel poverty than younger age  groups. Older people are more likely to live in older houses, which are less likely to be energy efficient. The  Housing Executive&rsquo;s &lsquo;Interim House Condition Survey  2004&rsquo;, clearly demonstrates that a large proportion of older people live  in accommodation that is in an unfit state  of repair, or below the decent homes standard. That is something that  must be addressed, urgently and effectively.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Statistics produced by the Child Poverty Action Group for  2003-06, indicate that 25% of children in the North are at risk of living in  poverty. Indeed, a recent report from Save the Children indicates that 7,000 children in my constituency are living in  poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Fuel poverty has an impact on the health of both the old  and young in society, which impacts directly on healthcare provisions. There  are many schemes in operation to help  relieve fuel poverty, such as the warm homes scheme. In 2006, 6,000  homes had insulation measures installed, at a total cost of &pound;11 million, and 320,000 people received winter fuel payments. However,  the continuing rise in the cost of oil, gas and electricity leaves many people,  who are on low and fixed incomes, at risk of fuel poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A home is in fuel poverty if, in order to maintain an acceptable temperature throughout the house,  occupants have to spend more than 10% of their income. Low income has been clearly shown to be a significant  cause of fuel poverty. In 2004, 68% of households with an annual income of under &pound;7,000 were in fuel  poverty. Realistic benefit and pension rates need to be imple&shy;mented to enable people to enjoy an acceptable standard of living.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Prior to 1988 &mdash; under  the old supplementary benefits scheme &mdash; heating costs were included as part of  benefits, and there were central heating additions. Those were abolished in  1988 with the advent of income support, and people now rely on the Social Fund,  which is budget limited and does not cater for heating costs. Other benefits  such as tax credits have been introduced to  supplement low wages and encourage people back to work. That scheme is a  shambles, and it has resulted in some people owing more than they receive. Fuel  poverty is a scourge on society, and its eradication requires a concerted  effort from all Depart&shy;ments, particularly DSD. Only when that happens will  fuel poverty be alleviated to any degree. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Fuel poverty is a serious issue, which not only affects many households in East Belfast, but households across the Province. The  importance that the Assembly attaches to this issue is evidenced by the fact  that it was debated on only the fourth sitting week following restoration of  the devolved institutions.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Although the Alliance Party welcomes any opportunity to advance practical  actions and proposals to address the blight of fuel poverty, I am disappointed  that today&rsquo;s motion does not progress the issue beyond what the House agreed on  29 May. That does not do justice to the seriousness of this issue &mdash; rather,  today&rsquo;s motion is a verbatim copy of the motion on fuel poverty that the  Assembly debated and agreed unanimously on 29 May 2007 &mdash; only 13 sitting days  ago and six sitting weeks ago.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The wording of today&rsquo;s motion is identical to the motion  that was debated on 29 May, and it is clear that it was resubmitted by the UUP  in error after the recess. However, when that fact was highlighted, the  proposer tried to justify the unaltered motion&rsquo;s resubmission after such a  short time, as if it were intentional. He would not admit that it was a  mistake.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  No. To say that the resubmission of an unaltered motion is normal parliamentary  procedure in order to keep an issue on the agenda is nonsense. It is neither  normal practice, nor good practice. There is no rule barring the return of a  motion, but one would reasonably expect &mdash; as the Business Committee obviously did &mdash; that Members who have serious  concerns about important issues such as fuel poverty would take the time  and effort to progress the debate or develop its arguments, rather than  regurgitate the same wording, parrot-fashion, only weeks after its initial  airing.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are many ways of monitoring progress on fuel poverty  since the previous debate. For instance, the submission of questions for oral  and written answers and follow-up through the Committee for Social Development  would more effectively hold the Minister and her Department to account, and  such measures would serve to keep such critical issues high on the Assembly&rsquo;s  agenda.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Deciding that the best form of defence is attack, the  proposer made a number of serious criticisms in the media about the alleged  complacency of officials in the Department for Social Development and about the  Minister&rsquo;s failure to undertake the review that was agreed. However, the motion  does not contain any reference to that departmental complacency or any  criticism &mdash; explicit or implicit &mdash; of the Minister or her departmental  officials. Neither does the motion request an update on progress or use the  word &ldquo;again&rdquo; to emphasise that the motion represents a repeat call on the  Minister. Any of those alterations would have prompted the Minister to address  those concerns in her response and afford her the opportunity to answer such  criticism. I wonder why those alterations were not made. One wonders if those  criticisms were the drivers for the motion returning to the House, or were they  simply half-baked excuses concocted in the light of the Ulster Unionists&rsquo;  oversight. In fact, the proposer indicated that he became aware of the motion  returning to the Chamber only when a representative from an outside body  informed him of it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of an opposing party, I am not in the habit of defending any Minister, or his or her  performance. I do, however, believe in fair play, so I draw Members&rsquo;  attention to the debate on 29 May. The Minister said that a full  house-condition survey was carried out last year, but that the full results  would not be available until October of this year. I imagine that the results  of that survey will be critical to any  comprehensive review of fuel poverty strategy as it will provide a  measure of progress to date, and it will be a basis for the assessment of the  effectiveness of the current strategy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is possible for anyone to make a mistake, but, for some, it is probable. However, what has been  objection&shy;able in this instance is that, rather than seeking to correct  his party&rsquo;s mistake via an amendment to update the motion or a withdrawal and resubmission of wording that  would reflect current concerns, the proposer has, instead, made an effort to  discredit the Minister and the Department&rsquo;s efforts in an attempt to justify  and deflect attention from the error.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Alban Maginness for tabling the amendment, which  moves the debate on in the context of the Programme for Government and the  Budget process. Some Members have mischievously suggested that my objection to  the motion&rsquo;s being rehashed, word for word, is due to my disinterest in fuel  poverty. That is unfounded and offensive. I have worked closely with the warm  homes scheme and the Warm Start project in my constituency. Take-up of the  schemes has been low compared to other areas, but I have promoted them in the  press, as well as signposting them in hundreds of thousands of leaflets, which  I have circulated.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members have quoted statistics, but I am going to  finish with the case of an elderly constituent, because it highlights the issue. The gentleman lived in a  draughty Victorian flat rented from a private developer. There was no heating  in that house except his open fire, and he had to move his bed into that room  to get any heat. He was finally rehoused last November after I visited him and wrote to the Department.  Unfortunately, he passed away from a chest complaint in the inter&shy;vening  period, and never actually set foot in his new home. It is unacceptable for  anyone to be living in those conditions. I will support the Minister, the  Department and the Executive in all serious efforts to address this issue.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>: I support the motion and the amendment, although, like others,  I am surprised to see it back before us so soon despite the widespread support  that it received in May. However, perhaps today will be of further benefit.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As politicians we should be fully aware of the worsening  impact that fuel poverty has on our communities, and of the fact that it is  costing lives. The figures are totally unacceptable. The Department for Social  Development&rsquo;s 2004 strategy, &lsquo;Ending Fuel Poverty&rsquo;, revealed that some 33% of  households in Northern    Ireland could not afford to heat their  homes. That means that one in three of us is spending more than 10% of their  annual income on heat in what they call their homes. It is a poor state of  affairs when the older population have to make a choice between fuel and food.  Surely, a home is not a home without warmth and food.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland we are proud that other countries  acknowledge us as being home- and family-orientated, yet the reality is that  33% of our homes are freezing, and the elderly are dying in them. The matter  that Ms Long finished on needs to be taken into consideration.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It has long been established that we have some of the  highest levels of fuel poverty in the UK. In my own constituency of East Antrim, 23% of people in Carrickfergus were unable  to adequately heat their homes, and in Larne the figure was around 36%.  Unfortunately, Craigavon and Magherafelt were identified as having the highest  rate, at more than 45%.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">According to the 2004 interim house condition survey, Northern Ireland  has 152,000 people &mdash; or 24% of households &mdash; living in cold homes. Those  vulnerable people are having their home life, health, environment, children&rsquo;s  educational attainment and social well-being affected by the knock-on effects  of fuel poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister for  Social Development still confident that we can eradicate the fuel  poverty in vulnerable households by 2010 and  in non-vulnerable households by 2016? Is that a realistic target? In  addition, by 2010 the Minister hopes that no household in the social-rented  sector will be suffering. Is that achievable, and has the Department got the  tools of the trade to do the job?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Social Development&rsquo;s strategy for ending  fuel poverty was to focus on people; adopt a partnership approach; build on the  commitment of community and voluntary groups, businesses, local authorities and  statutory agencies; promote equality of opportunity, target social need and  promote inclusion; focus on the maximum practical help for households in fuel  poverty; seek to provide cost-effective solutions to fuel poverty; and benefit  the environment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In May the Assembly decided that the strategy had to be  urgently reviewed, and now it is time to show our communities what the  Department is going to do to ensure that the 2010 and 2016 deadlines are met.  Not all the options have been totally exhausted, such as looking at the advice  we have to offer. Are we offering enough  simple free advice on the grants that are available through the warm  homes scheme? Are people really aware that they can save money on their energy  bills?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Research shows that  thousands of people in Northern Ireland could make significant savings by availing of the  insulation measures that are available. Not everyone is aware of them,  but another problem could be the cultural  resistance issue mentioned by Mr Ken Robinson. On average, 25% of the  heat in homes escapes through the walls, 25% is lost through uninsulated lofts  and between 10% and 15% escapes through gaps around doors and windows. We  should be emphasising that loft insulation, draughtproofing of windows and  doors, cavity wall insulation, reflective  radiator panels on solid walls, hot-water-tank jackets and compact  fluorescent lamps are all available through  the scheme. The number of homes that have already availed of them has  risen from 8,250 to 10,000, which is to be  welcomed, through the warm homes scheme. In 2004, 91% to 94% of people  who did avail of the grants found them very successful, and found that they  changed their homes for the better.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly should also explore the promotion of renewable  energy, which has the potential to save 25% on energy bills. Over the past few  years, we have seen an increased interest in the use of solar panels,  wood-burning boilers and alternatives to fossil fuels. More people should be  encouraged to choose those types of heating systems.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">More promotion could be done in schools to encourage  children to get involved in saving energy. Our environment would reap the  rewards in years to come if that type of energy-saving behaviour were instilled  in children from an early age. The costs involved would be an investment in the  fight against fuel poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly should be making a concentrated effort to  co-ordinate the work of the Department for Social Development with the other  relevant Departments &mdash; the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First  Minister, the Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development, the Department of the  Environment, the Department of Finance and Personnel, and the Department  for Employment and Learning. That would not only eradicate fuel poverty, but  would save lives, reduce child poverty, create a greener environment, reduce  our Health Service bills, decrease and control rates during the winter season,  encourage more people to seek employment, and upgrade the overall standard of  our homes and properties.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. At the risk of setting off Naomi Long again, I commend the  proposer of the motion. If MLAs do not see any substantial movement on any  matters, they have a right to come back and debate the issue again in the  Assembly. That is called accountability.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister to the debate. She covered many of  the issues that have arisen today during the previous debate in May this year.  However, the effects of fuel poverty are serious and wide ranging, and are not  simply the discomfort of low temperatures. Cold, damp environments cause or  worsen the effects of a wide range of physical conditions. Children who live in  fuel poverty have higher levels of asthma and other diseases. We are all too  aware of the impact that the cold weather has on older people. According to a  report that was sent to all MLAs, 1,360 older people die each year as a result  of cold weather in the North. We have a duty to come back and debate issues in  the Assembly if we do not see substantial movement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">During the previous  debate on this matter, the Minister</span> highlighted that ill health  associated with cold weather cost the Health Service here around &pound;40 million a  year. <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">We must see fuel poverty tackled so  that money is freed</span> up to ensure that other health issues are dealt  with.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is essential that DSD&rsquo;s strategy for ending fuel  poverty, which was in place in 2004, addresses and delivers on its targets of  eradicating fuel poverty in vulnerable households by 2010, and in  non-vulnerable households by 2016. Figures suggest that there has been a  reduction in the total number of fuel-poor households between 2001 and 2004.  However, I hope that the Minister will outline whether targets are being  achieved, although she will probably not have that information available today.  In 2004, the target number for vulnerable fuel-poor households was 158,000, in  2006 it was 110,000, and in 2007 the target is 80,000. I would appreciate it if  the Minister could outline to MLAs if those targets are being reached, or  whether they are being carried over on a yearly basis. We are not far away from  2010, and I want to know now whether those targets will be reached.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those figures do not show that account has been taken of  the impact of substantial increases in fuel prices. Previous contributors to  the debate have referred to the impact of the cold weather, and yesterday was  probably one of the coldest days that we have had in a long time. Everyone  needs oil and gas, and fuel prices could further increase. Energy prices have  already risen by around 80%, whereas incomes have increased by 6% and benefits  by 2%, meaning that for every 10% increase in the price of fuel, another 8,000  households are added to the category of those suffering from fuel poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also concern that there could be new and emerging  groups living in fuel poverty, particularly among the working poor. It is of  great concern that 47% of all children who live in fuel poverty live in  households with one working adult.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Previous Members spoke about another group that is  particularly vulnerable to fuel poverty: the isolated rural poor. The  Department for Social Development&rsquo;s strategy must adapt to meet the needs of  that group.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department and the Minister must make an even more  concerted effort if they are to meet their targets. The Minister has probably  received the strategy for ending fuel poverty, which was emailed to all  Members. I will quote some statistics that were gathered by Pat Austin, who is  on the fuel poverty advisory group and who the proposer of the motion  mentioned. All Members received those figures yesterday. However, that group  asks whether any progress has been made on the strategy, given that it was  launched 26 months ago.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Resources must be allocated for energy efficiency,  education and training, ending fuel poverty, and measures to improve physical  conditions. There must be improved data collection. The Assembly can deal with  some issues, so I will pass them on. Members are not asking those questions;  they are being asked by the advisory panel.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Similar to other Members, I have noted with interest that questions have been  asked in the past few days as to why, in the space of a few months, we are once  again debating fuel poverty in Northern    Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: Will the Member take a short intervention?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Very short.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: To  clarify, the problem is not that we are debating fuel poverty; I object to the  identical, word-for-word motions of the debates.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">Mr Craig</span></strong>: As I was going to say, whatever the reason for this motion being tabled, the issue is not  the number of debates that Members have on the matter, but what we, as a  newly formed Assembly, can do to continue the good work of the previous  Assembly to address the important issue of fuel poverty in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I stated in the previous debate on fuel poverty, some  good work has been done to reduce the number of  households that fall into the poverty trap. As Assembly Members, we  should not rest on past achievements, but continue the good work that has been  done to bring everyone out of the fuel-poverty trap that so many are still in.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The &lsquo;2004 Interim House Condition Survey&rsquo; shows that  between 2001 and 2004 there was a reduction in the total number of people  suffering as a result of fuel poverty: in  2001 there were 203,000, falling to 152,000 in 2004. As with all such  figures, a health warning should be attached. Since 2004, there has been a  major hike in fuel costs, which automatically caused deep distress to many  households in the Province.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In comparison with the  2001 survey, the 2004 survey shows that massive strides have been taken  by the Housing Executive to reduce the numbers of those suffering as a result  of fuel poverty. In 2001, over 70,000 people living in Housing Executive  accommo&shy;dation were in fuel poverty. In 2004, that figure had decreased to  25,000. That massive decrease did not happen by chance but as a result of the  Housing <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">Executive&rsquo;s hard work on two levels:  strategic and local</span>. At the local level, district managers implemented  programmes that have rejuvenated their areas, and they have upgraded the age  and condition of their housing stock. It is right that the Assembly recognises  the hard work that the Housing Executive  has done on the issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The introduction of the warm homes scheme by the then  Minister for Social Development, Lord Morrow, has  been another major success in tackling fuel poverty. That scheme has  been tremendously successful and has been  the vehicle that many vulnerable people have used to introduce  energy-saving measures to their homes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In its first year, the  warm homes scheme had a budget of &pound;3&middot;7 million, but that has risen to  &pound;20&middot;5 million.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, the fact that 52,000 homes have benefited  from the scheme can counted as money well spent.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Schemes cost money, but can the Assembly put a price on the  quality of citizens&rsquo; lives, many of whom are senior citizens who live in old  properties and who need help from Government bodies and schemes?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The way to tackle fuel poverty is to examine the successes  and learn from the failures. All schemes so far have failed to reach elderly  people who own their own homes and have a small occupational pension. That, in  addition to the rising cost of upgrading home heating systems because of new  building control regulations, leads one to the conclusion that perhaps now is  the right time for a review of the warm homes scheme to allow it to target more  effectively those who are still in fuel poverty. We have a job of work ahead of  us.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Mr Beggs mentioned that we had the first touch of frost last night, but it did  very little to cool Mrs Long down. I want to point out to Mrs Long that the  motion was tabled with the best intentions. I am glad that she knows so much  about the internal workings of the Ulster Unionist Party; she is welcome to  join the party.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Thank you, but no thank you.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I have just been told by my deputy leader that the party does not want her.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am surprised that Mrs Long stated that submitting  questions for oral or written answer would have been better than the Minister  being present for a full debate; she thinks that that is a more effective way  to achieve accountability. A debate is the proper channel for the issue of fuel  poverty, which is why the motion was tabled using the same wording as the May  motion. It is an important debate, and it becomes more relevant at this time of  year as winter draws in. I am surprised that Mrs Long made such an issue about  the motion when the majority of Members have said that it is right and proper  that this relevant issue is debated.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has been a member of the SDLP for many years,  and her colleague Mr Maginness pointed out that winter fuel payments are a Westminster issue. It is  strange, therefore, that the SDLP sits on the same Benches as the governing  Labour Party.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To turn to some of the points made by Ms Ramsey, there are  several strands to the fuel poverty debate. The health implications of fuel  poverty are a big issue; it is a key interest of mine, as a member of the  Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety. Many families in Northern Ireland  that live in fuel poverty suffer from respiratory conditions and other  ailments. Hospital treatment for those conditions would cost the taxpayer more  than alleviating fuel poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Like other Members, I pay tribute to the warm homes scheme,  which has done tremendous work in Northern Ireland by tackling issues  such as inefficient home heating. As other Members said, there is a huge job to be done in rolling out that scheme as  quickly and effectively as possible.  It is a particular issue for Members such as me who represent large  rural constituencies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Robinson mentioned, there is also a problem with  people not claiming their entitlements. The Department for Social Development  and the Minister have a responsibility to ensure that entitlements are claimed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have some concerns about &mdash; and I ask the Minister to  comment on &mdash; the Department for Social Development&rsquo;s reforms and modernisation.  If some offices close as a result of those reforms, how will that impact on the  Department&rsquo;s work and getting inform&shy;ation on entitlements to members of the  public and to the target groups that we should be focusing on?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This is an important issue, and I am glad that so many  Members are present to listen to the debate. As Mr Hilditch mentioned, several issues about the various options  have to be addressed, such as renewable energy. The cost of health, if those  issues are not addressed, needs to be considered.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am proud that my party has again proposed this subject  for debate. Members of the Alliance Party should hold their heads in shame for  being so critical of the motion. It is right and proper that the Minister  should come to the House to update Members on the work that is going on. That  is the proper avenue in which to do that.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I support the amendment. I have every confidence that something will be done  about the issue of fuel poverty. I am not going to quote all of the figures &mdash;  that has already been done by almost every Member who has spoken in the debate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that all Members agree that the people who suffer  most from fuel poverty are older people and children. A recent report funded by  the Northern Ireland  Commissioner for Children and Young People (NICCY),  the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, and the  Department of Finance and Personnel highlighted a disgraceful situation: our  children are less valuable than children in England,  Scotland or Wales. Indeed,  they are less valued by &pound;226. Scotland  spends &pound;513 per head on children&rsquo;s services, Wales &pound;429 and England &pound;402.  In Northern Ireland,  children are valued at &pound;287 &mdash; that is what is spent on a child. If our children  cannot be kept warm, dry and nourished, there is definitely some failure in the  system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also the issue of the working poor &mdash; the people  that have jobs with low pay. They get little help. What financial assistance  they do get comes from a benefit called tax credits, which is generally a  hindrance as more often than not it is taken back in huge amounts and labelled  as an overpayment. That forces people into debt and affects the amount of money  that they have to keep their homes warm &mdash; the main priority is to try to feed  their families.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Another issue is the warm homes scheme. Over the past number  of weeks, my constituency office has received more than a few complaints from  people who have been contacted by agencies to make arrangements to install  heating systems, only to be contacted again and told that the work cannot be  started, or, in some cases, completed. The  agencies run out of money because their budgets are totally inadequate.  I want that issue to be addressed. If older people and families can at least  keep their homes warm, and still have enough money to live on, it would go a  long way towards tackling fuel poverty. We, as representatives, should do all  that we can to bring fuel poverty to an end.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We all have concerns  that the target for the eradication of fuel poverty by 2010 will not be  met. However, I hope that we are on track to make that happen. In order to be  able to make a dent in the economic blight that is fuel poverty, agencies must  be given the proper budget allocation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not going to mention anything about what Naomi Long  said, or anything else &mdash; Naomi is entitled to do what she wants. However, I  welcome the fact that the motion is being debated in the Chamber today because  the aim of eradicating fuel poverty must be kept on track. It is very important  that fuel poverty is dealt with in order to  allow people to live comfortable and, indeed, contented lives.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: I thank Members for their contributions.  I hope to address each of the issues raised; however, if I cannot do so today,  I am happy to write to Members on any outstanding matters.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is some surprise  that the Assembly is discussing a motion similar to the one debated at  the end of May. However, I welcome Members&rsquo; continuing interest in the work of  my Department in tackling the scourge that is fuel poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I was, however, disappointed to hear it reported that there  was complacency in my Department&rsquo;s work to eradicate  fuel poverty. Since I became Minister for Social Development, I have  made it clear that I am fully committed to  the eradication of fuel poverty which, as we all know, impacts on  housing, health, the environment, the educational attainment of our children  and the social inclusion of some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged  members of our community.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me be clear. My  Department and I are committed to tackling fuel poverty and there is no  room for classifying me, or my Department,  as complacent. There is no room for complacency.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland and GB-wide targets on eradicating fuel poverty were included  in &lsquo;Ending Fuel Poverty: A Strategy for Northern Ireland&rsquo;, which was  launched in November 2004. Those targets sought to eradicate fuel poverty in  all vulnerable households by 2010, and in all other households by 2016. Even  back in 2004, those targets were recognised as challenging and dependent on the  volatility of fuel prices. That remains the case. However, we must not lose  sight of what we are trying to achieve. Although the timescale is challenging,  and may ultimately prove beyond us, we must remain focused on the outcomes that  our people deserve. It is simply unacceptable that, in this day and age, people  live in cold homes because they cannot afford to heat them. That is one issue  on which the House is united.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During the last debate on fuel poverty, I gave an undertaking that I would write to the Minister  responsible for winter fuel payments in the UK Department for Work and  Pensions. I raised the issue of rising fuel costs and the impact that they were  having on GB and Northern    Ireland targets. Moreover, I highlighted the  fact that those most at risk were often those who most needed help, such as the  ill, the elderly and those on low incomes &mdash; often referred to as the working  poor.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be surprised to hear that the Minister of  State for Work and Pensions declined my request to increase winter fuel  payments &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Shame.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I have, nonetheless, been given an assurance that he will keep under review the  possibility of further action on fuel poverty. I have asked my officials to  arrange a meeting with the Minister of State and I will revisit the subject  with him &mdash; of that Members may be assured.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, much progress  has been made, particularly in recent years, and it would be wrong not  to recognise that. My Department will shortly publish the results of research  undertaken on temperature-related mortality. Early findings indicate that, in  recent years, there has been a substantial decline in such deaths. For example,  in the past six years alone, the proportion of deaths linked to temperature has  fallen by around 10%. Over the past 25 years, and particularly in the past  decade, the number of circulatory and respiratory deaths has reduced. There  were nearly 8,700 fewer such deaths in the period 2000 to 2004 than in the  previous five years, and far fewer of those were linked to temperature.  However, the numbers are still too high.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those findings serve only to demonstrate the real progress  that we have made in tackling fuel poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The results are encouraging, and I expect to publish the  full report by November 2007.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Much of the success to date is due to initiatives such as  the Housing Executive&rsquo;s improvement and main&shy;tenance programme, and the warm  homes scheme, which has been duly  acknowledged in the House today. It  is an indication of the importance of those programmes that the  Department for Social Development continues to channel significant amounts of  money into them. For example, in the last financial year, the programmes spent  approximately &pound;44 million, and, as a result, around 16,000 homes were provided  with energy efficient measures. In the past year alone, the warm homes scheme  has supported 10,000 homes &mdash; nearly 2,000 more than the previous year. In  addition, the eligibility criteria for central heating systems has been  extended to include those aged 60 or over who are in receipt of  non-means-tested disability-related benefits.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Funding is also available for a number of fuel poverty  partnership schemes operating in conjunction with our main programmes, which  help to address the needs of those vulnerable people who may fall just outside  the scope of the warm homes scheme.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This year, Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE), will manage a package of measures worth &pound;4&middot;5 million,  aimed at providing central heating and insulation to priority vulnerable  households across the North. That funding has been provided by the Energy Efficiency  Levy <span style="letter-spacing:-.35pt; ">programme, and will provide affordable warmth to house&shy;</span>holds that are ineligible for the  Government scheme.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that a new category is not created for  those likely to be affected by fuel poverty from across the most vulnerable and  needy in society. I want to eradicate, not simply manage fuel poverty. I want  to reach those on low incomes, and the working poor. The grants from NIE will  directly target that group, and will complement existing Government schemes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The number of households affected by fuel poverty dropped  from 33% in 2001 to 24% in 2004. I eagerly await the findings of the full  survey that was carried out last year, the findings of which will be available  soon. In addition, 97% of properties across the North now have a form of  central heating. Those results certainly do not reflect the work of a  Department that is complacent in tackling fuel poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members have correctly identified the problems associated  with rising fuel prices. The increases that we have witnessed in the past few  years represent a significant threat to our target for eradicating fuel  poverty. Although increased costs are not unique to this region, the impact is  felt much more in Northern Ireland,  given the costs for coal and other forms of fuel, which are historically higher  when compared with other regions in Great Britain.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to see that there have been price reductions  in both gas and electricity earlier this year. I understand that Phoenix  Natural Gas may announce a further price reduction before the onset of winter.  I am sure that all Members will join me in welcoming such a reduction, if and  when it is announced.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The vision of a society where people live in warm and  comfortable homes will only be realised through the continuation of such  combined efforts. People should not have to worry about the effects of the cold  on their health, nor should they be too frightened to turn on their heating  when the temperature falls.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A great deal has been achieved, but there is significantly  more to do. I have re-established &mdash; and chair &mdash; the interdepartmental group on  fuel poverty, which examines new and innovative ways to tackle fuel poverty.  All Departments and Executive Ministers must buy into the eradication of fuel  poverty. I am confident that we will continue to make significant progress in tackling the issue by working in  partnership.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have also asked the Northern Ireland Fuel Poverty  Advisory Group to carry out research to identify how to best help the working  poor.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must also tackle the level of assistance that goes  unclaimed each year. It is frustrating that those people who are, quite often,  most in need do not always realise that help is available to them. I am  determined to do more to help people to access the full range of support that is  available to them. I encourage Members to do all that they can in that respect  through their constituency offices.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In coming weeks, the Executive will meet to identify a  Programme for Government and a Budget to deliver  that work. That is why, at the outset of the debate, I welcomed the  opportunity to discuss fuel poverty with the Assembly and place it in central  focus once again. The timing of the debate could not be more helpful. However,  there is a cautionary warning; the amendment calls for the Executive to make  the eradication of fuel poverty a priority  in the forthcoming Programme for Government. I recognise that there are  many demands on the Executive as it seeks to identify its first Programme for  Government. However, I assure Members that I will do all that I can, both in my  Department and with Executive colleagues, to ensure that the eradication of  fuel poverty remains at the forefront of the work being done to target social  need, tackle disadvantage and lift people out of poverty. I hope that the view  of my colleagues in the Executive will coincide with mine and that of the  Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many years ago, I entered politics to campaign for those  who are on the margins of society; the disadvantaged and the vulnerable. Having  spent all those years lobbying from the outside, the Assembly can be sure that  I will not miss my opportunity now that I am on the inside. I represent a rural  constituency, where there has been a substantial uptake of the warm homes  scheme, and it is an important issue for me. Members can rest assured that I am  not in the least bit complacent about the challenge ahead.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to address several issues that were raised. Mr  Maginness asked how rural fuel poverty is being targeted. I understand the  complexities of fuel poverty and I am convinced that its alleviation requires  strategic intervention from my Department and others. Work is already ongoing  in that respect. However, I accept that further work is required to address the  inequalities between urban and rural areas. One of the priorities for the Northern    Ireland fuel poverty advisory group  and the interdepartmental group on fuel poverty is the issue of rural fuel  poverty; in particular, the low uptake of measures, especially west of the  Bann. The goal of the Executive and my Department is to refocus our efforts on  targeting and education.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development, Mr  Campbell, raises significant issues. I thank him and the Committee for their  continuing support for my Budget bids. I have no doubt that that support will  continue. I also thank Mrs Long for her support in acknowledging that the road  ahead will be difficult, but that we must  all work together collectively to eradicate fuel poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The warm homes scheme is also available to those who live  in the private-rented sector and to owner-occupiers. Since the scheme began, it  has delivered insulation and heating measures to 6,000 households in that  sector.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My constituency colleague Mr John McCallister referred to  benefit uptake and social security returns. Members will recall that in May,  shortly after taking up my appointment, I announced a benefit uptake campaign  for 2007 in which I encouraged people to apply for all the benefits to which  they are entitled. Later in the year, that was followed up by a letter from the  Social Security Agency to all people who are elderly, infirm or who are  suffering from mental ill health to urge them to take up those benefits. Many  of those people fall into the category of those who could suffer from fuel  poverty.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank Members for their contributions, particularly on the amend&shy;ment. I  thank the Minister for the reassurance that she and her Department are totally  committed to the eradication of fuel poverty. If nothing else, the motion has  served a good purpose in uniting the House in a commitment to the pursuit of  that objective. I hope that in the coming weeks, when the Executive are drawing  up their Programme for Government, the eradication of fuel poverty will be a  top priority.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that action has been taken on the issue since it was last debated. She said that the  inter&shy;departmental body dealing with fuel poverty has been  re-established and that she, as Minister, is chairperson of that body. That is  to be welcomed. The Minister also said that she will renew her efforts with Westminster to have the  winter fuel payment increased &mdash; as it should be,  in all justice. It is totally disproportionate, compared to its original  value in 2000. I hope that the whole House,  including those Members who are also Members at Westminster, will support the Minister in  putting pressure on the Government to make that increase, which is essential.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that,  if we had waited a little longer, the household survey would probably  have been completed and the findings could have been discussed in the House. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I did not hear what the Member said.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There were many other contributions, all delivered with  real concern by Members who were united in tackling the issue. I thank Mr Beggs  for accepting the amendment; I hope that it can be passed with the unanimous  support of the House.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Campbell, as Chairperson of the Committee for Social  Development, said that he was concerned about some aspects of the Department&rsquo;s  policy on the elimination of fuel poverty, but he gave his general support. He  also gave his support to any bids that the Minister might submit in order to  tackle fuel poverty, which is to be welcomed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brady was concerned that the target dates were  unattainable &mdash; although he did not offer any evidence of that. Mrs Naomi Long,  in her inimitable fashion &mdash; a breathless tour de force &mdash; outlined her concern  about the motion being reintroduced in the House. I had tremendous sympathy  with her, as I too could not divine the real  reason why the motion was reintroduced. Nevertheless, its reintroduction  has allowed Members to revisit this vital subject. I thank Mrs Long for her  support &mdash; despite the efforts of Mr Kennedy and others to interrupt her.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hilditch, in characteristic fashion, committed himself  to supporting the Department and its policy on fuel poverty, and hoped that its  targets would be realistic. Sue Ramsey also said that she supported the motion.  However, she felt that there had not been any substantial  movement on the matter. I cannot understand the full force of that  criticism, as we are dealing with a three-month period only. Ms Ramsey wanted  more concerted action; the Minister has proven that there has been concerted  action on the issue of fuel poverty, and that concerted action will continue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Craig, Mr McCallister and Mrs Bradley made interesting  contributions and showed their full support for the motion, as amended.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  thank the Members who contributed constructively to the debate and who continue  to show their concern about fuel poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I was taught that reiteration is a good method of  reinforcing one&rsquo;s point. That was one of the reasons for the wording of the motion. I was pleased that the  all-party Business Committee selected the motion for debate, giving us  the opportunity to discuss this matter today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Complacency on the part of senior civil servants has been  observed. Members who work on this matter raised concerns about the strategy to  end fuel poverty. This debate has given the Minister an opportunity to update  the Assembly on the progress that has been made since we last discussed this  issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I would also point out to some Members that, in other  places, debates on the same issue are held year after year, as methods of  reinforcing the point. For example, in the House of Commons, there have been  early-day motions on fuel poverty in 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003. That can  happen, and it is important to reinforce an issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate and accept the clear commitments made by the  Minister to work constructively to end fuel poverty. I ask the Minister to note  that the comment that I made about complacency was not directed at her, it was  about a permanent secretary. I was not attacking her &mdash; I accept the commitment  that she has made, and I am aware that she will continue to work on this issue.  Perhaps she will address that matter with the appropriate staff.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also hope that, in the short term, more statistics on  fuel poverty will be published. That is an important way of driving the issue  forward and identifying whether progress is being made, and what additional strategies and actions may be needed. I ask the  Minister to take up Sue Ramsey&rsquo;s suggestion that measurements should be  published regularly. That is a constructive way to identify whether progress  has been made or whether the strategy has stalled.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the questions that  Members asked during the debate. I ask her and her staff to review the Hansard  report and provide answers to those questions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate has been helpful in that it will remind civil  servants of the importance of fuel poverty. I support the amendment because it  will move the matter <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">forward, and, I hope,  help to prioritise it in the Programme</span> for Government. As I said  yesterday, there is also a role for  ordinary Assembly Members, particularly those who are members of the  relevant Committees &mdash; as they view the draft Budget, they can give the issue  the necessary priority. Choices will have to be made, and that will perhaps  mean disappointment in other areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that there are methods by which we can make progress  on this issue, and that Members will drive the issue forward through a variety of methods. That would be  worthwhile. I also hope that we can come together to support the amendment &mdash; as  all sides have indicated &mdash; and that the House, as a whole, will make progress  and help to end fuel poverty in our society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">Question, </span>That the amendment be  made, <span class="Italic">put and agreed to</span>.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the debate on fuel poverty which  took place on 29th May 2007 and the resolution adopted; and calls on the  Executive to prioritise the elimination of fuel poverty in the forthcoming  Programme for Government.</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="5"></a>School Openings and Amalgamations</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to  propose and 10 minutes for the winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to  speak will have five minutes. One amendment has been selected and published on  the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes to  propose and five minutes for the winding-up speech.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes with concern some of the decisions  taken by the Minister of Education over the summer recess on school openings  and amalgamations; and calls upon the Minister to clarify her approach to the  recommendations of the Bain Report and the Sustainable Schools Policy published  by her Department.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me make it clear to the House, lest I cause some of my  colleagues on the Committee for Education to jump up and down, that I am moving  the motion in a personal capacity and not as the Chairperson of the Committee.  I was instructed to say that because I was told that I might be censored by the  Committee; although, to be truthful, I wonder whether that might not be a bad  idea. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Jo Moore got herself into trouble on 11 September 2001 for  saying that it was a good day to bury bad news. The Minister of Education has  learned from the example given by Jo Moore, because over the summer, she has taken the opportunity, when the eyes of  Members of the Assembly and its scrutiny Committees were turned  elsewhere, and perhaps, when the press were not as focused on political issues,  not just to bury bad news, but to bury  departmental policy, to hide inconsistent decisions and to engage in  biased decisions. In fact, the Minister of Education has been digging so  furiously that she is like some kind of demented political gravedigger, and the  holes are littering the drive up to Rathgael House. Indeed, because of the  holes that the Minister has dug, the drive up to Rathgael House is probably  worse than some of the roads that Barry McElduff says exist in the west of the  Province.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For a minute or two, I want to go through some of the  decisions that the Minister has made, and then I want to examine some of the policies that her Department has  published. Thirdly, I want to consider some of the things that the Minister has  said to the Assembly and analyse the consequences of her decisions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The first decision that the Minister announced during the  summer holidays was the amalgamation of two maintained schools in and just  outside the village of Ahoghill &mdash; St Joseph&rsquo;s Primary School, and St Patrick&rsquo;s  Primary School in Aughtercloney. Between them, those two schools had a total of  43 pupils. Even when amalgamated, they did not form a school that met the  criteria set out in the Bain Report. They had a combined deficit of &pound;300,000.  There was no chance that pupil numbers would increase; indeed, the North  Eastern Education and Library Board made it clear to the Minister that the  amalgamation would not result in the long-term viability of the schools, but  would, in fact, incur longer-term consequences.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The two schools are now lumbered with the costs of  protected staff salaries, which will probably lead, in two years&rsquo; time, to  another deficit of about &pound;200,000 when protected staff status is lost. The  decision to amalgamate the schools was contrary to the views of the North  Eastern Education and Library Board and totally contrary, as I will show in a  moment, to the policies that the Minister has tried to tell the Assembly that  her Department must follow, and for which she hopes to get support in this  House.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The second decision made by the Minister was the  announcement of three Irish-medium schools: one in Londonderry,  one in Crumlin and one in Glengormley. The schools in Londonderry and  Glengormley each had an intake of 15  pupils, and the school in Crumlin had an intake of 12 pupils &mdash; well  below the standard set in the Bain Report, and well below the standard set in  the Minister&rsquo;s consultation document on sustainable schools policy. Yet, those  decisions were made against a background &mdash;  that the Minister knows her Department faces  &mdash; of 50,000 extra, but unnecessary, school places in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">According to the Bain  Report &mdash; which is the Minister&rsquo;s</span> own document &mdash; those 50,000 places represent  unaccep&shy;table &ldquo;excessive recurrent costs&rdquo; and are a financial strain on the  Department of Education. The Bain Report has made it clear that rationalisation  will be required, and it has set certain thresholds for when schools should be  considered for closure. At times, the Assembly has challenged those thresholds,  but, even allowing for some flexibility, the schools that I have mentioned are  well below the Bain thresholds.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The second Department of Education document to which I  shall refer is called &lsquo;A Consultation on Schools for the Future: A Policy for  Sustainable Schools&rsquo;. That sets out certain criteria that must be adhered to  before the opening of a school can be considered.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The first criterion is that the financial viability of the  school must be examined. The document  points out that primary schools that have 80 to 100 pupils will cost  around 16% more than primary schools that have more than 140 pupils &mdash; the size  of an average school. A school that has fewer than 50 pupils will cost nearly  200% more than the average, and a school that has fewer than 20 pupils will  cost nearly 300% more.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What has the Minister done? At a time of financial constraint, she has opened one school by  amalgamating two that have 43 pupils, with an average cost of nearly 200%  more than a school that has 140 pupils. She has opened three schools, with  costs that are nearly 300% more than those of the average school. Despite that,  I anticipate that the Minister will tell the House that her Department is under  financial strain.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The second criterion is that schools should be not only in  a sound financial position, but should be able to offer quality education. The  Minister has opened three Irish-language  schools at a time when, as she said in  a written answer to me before the recess, around 23% of teachers in  Irish-language schools are unqualified, contrary to the Teachers&rsquo; (Eligibility)  Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 1997. The Minister cannot get  enough qualified Irish-language teachers, yet she gaily opens more schools in  the absence of trained staff. How on earth will she ever guarantee quality  education in those schools? The schools have  small pupil numbers and a curriculum that is not broad enough and that  is taught by unqualified teachers, yet the  Minister gaily indulgences in her own personal prejudice.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The third criterion in  the sustainable schools strategy is that there must be stable enrolment  trends. I know that the Minister will say that for the next seven years only 15 pupils in each year group have to enrol.  However, she does not know that that number will enrol; she knows only  what the enrolment in Irish-language schools will be this year. Perhaps the  Minister knows how many youngsters who are aged one, two, three and four will  enrol &mdash; but does she know how many of those people who are interested in the  Irish language will conceive youngsters in three or six years&rsquo; time? If she has  those predictive powers, I want her to pick my lottery numbers this week.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Shame, shame. Resign, resign. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  OK, I withdraw that; I do not want her to pick my lottery numbers.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>: I will give way later, but I want to finish.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  It would be better if the Member resigned now before he is pushed, given the  admission that he has just made.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>: I thank the Member for those remarks.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is asking us to fund schools on the basis that  she can predict an intake for people who are not even born. How can she claim  that there is a guaranteed, stable enrolment trend? She has not tested it in  any of those areas, as there are no other schools.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One could be forgiven for thinking that the Minister really  did not believe in those policies and criteria. I thought that I would have to  delve into comments that she made to the Assembly or to the Committee for  Education in May or June.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In fact, I need only go back to yesterday&rsquo;s Question Time, when the Minister said the following about small  schools:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Politicians cannot be ostriches &hellip; We ignore the  current demographics in our society at our peril.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">She went on to say that it is &ldquo;not in the best  interests&rdquo; of children to be taught in schools with only 20 or 30 children.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister did not make those comments a year ago, six  months ago or even before the summer; she made  those comments yesterday. However, the decisions that she made during  the summer contradict all her comments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Her decisions have consequences for the education budget  and, as I was informed in a letter from the North Eastern Education and Library  Board, for future rationalisation. The board&rsquo;s chief executive told me that he  would find it hard to sell the idea to people in his area.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ar dt&uacute;s ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; nach  mbeidh m&eacute; ag caint mar LeasChathaoirleach an Choiste Oideachais.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make it clear that I am not speaking as the  Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Education. I have proposed an amendment  to the motion, because the motion states that the sustainable schools policy  has been &ldquo;published&rdquo; by the Department, whereas that has not yet happened.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the sentiments of the original motion, in so  far as they refer to the need for the Minister to clarify her approach to the  Bain Report. The best way for the Minister  to do that is to publish her Department&rsquo;s sustainable schools policy.  Although the consultation on the policy ended on 16 April 2007, it has still  not been published.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Even though parents, teachers and pupils are in a state of  uncertainty as to what the future holds for them, the Minister told the  Assembly that she will not be rushed into telling Members, or the general  public, what form of transfer procedure will replace the 11-plus. I hope that  the Minister does not say to the Assembly today that she will not be rushed  into publishing the sustainable schools policy, because a huge part of the  review of public administration (RPA), as it relates to education, depends on  it. Under RPA reforms, the Department of Education is tasked with establishing:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the strategic direction for education, setting  policy, priorities and standards for schools and youth services&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As the policies are not in place, even though some 21  months have elapsed since the beginning of the process, how can the Department  achieve that? As Members know, policy drives practice, and the fact that many  policies, including this one, are not yet in place is a clear case of the cart  being before the horse. In fact, the horse seems to be grazing the long acre  with the shafts of the cart stuck in the ground somewhere.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Clear policies are needed to ensure an even-handed approach  in all sectors according to their need. Policy is required to bring clarity and  transparency to the situation. Many issues in the reforms depend on a workable,  sustainable schools policy. For example, under area planning rules, the  planning of the school estate cannot be implemented without such a policy. The  Department plans to begin the movement towards reform through the convergence  of the education and library boards with the education and skills authority  (ESA).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Area planning is to be introduced by administrative means  followed by legislation. In a two-Bill approach, the first Bill will give the  ESA a duty to secure the effective planning of schools, which will pave the way  for the development of the area planning process. The second Bill will be more  detailed and contain new provisions to replace the current legislation on  development proposals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Department says that the legislation must be  informed by further policy development from the early work of the boards and  the ESA. Where is the sustainable schools policy that will be an essential  signpost? There is uncertainty in many schools, homes and among education  providers about what the future holds. As Members know, uncertainty breeds fear  and lowers morale. The Assembly is setting out on a road to change, but does it  know where it is going?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The policy signposts have not been erected, and without  them we are in danger of going astray and ending up in a place we never  intended to be in. Direction needs to be put into the process, and the first  step on the journey would be to have the sustainable schools policy published  without further delay.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The previous Minister of Education, Maria Eagle, accepted  the Bain recommendations in full. The current Minister of Education has  indicated that she accepts the  recommendations in principle, but Members need clarification as to which  recommendations are now to be subject to further discussion or change. The Bain  figures for enrolment &mdash; around 115 pupils for a primary school; 500 pupils for  a post-primary school; and 100 pupils for sixth-form provision &mdash; were not set  as the minimum threshold for retention but rather as reviewed thresholds. Does  the Minister accept and agree with those figures? The Assembly requires the  Minister&rsquo;s answer.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to small primary schools, Bain also refers to  schools having composite classes, with no more than two year-groups per class.  That equates to having four teachers. The current average pupil-teacher ratio  and the local management of schools (LMS) arrangements in primary schools would  allow such schools to function with around 80 pupils. Does the Minister accept  that estimate?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A significant number of schools have around 55 to 60 pupils  and three teachers. While those schools require additional support for the  challenges they face, in the main they are financially and educationally  viable, and an option for their retention should be available. I would like to  know the Department&rsquo;s and the Minister&rsquo;s stance on those particular schools.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wilson mentioned the amalgamation of two schools in  Ahoghill. The proposal to merge those schools into one small primary school did  not meet the criteria set out in the Bain Report. However, according to that  report, policy must take account of the needs of communities, whether they are  rural communities or communities representing one sector. The report also  states that there will always be a need to retain a few schools that sit  outside the recommended figures and that policy should accommodate such  exceptions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an urgent need for clarification, and the only way  that that can be achieved in a useful and transparent way is through the  publication of the Department&rsquo;s sustainable schools policy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A LeasCheann Comhairle, ba mhaith liom achoimri&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh  ar an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite agam ar an leas&uacute;: gur ch&oacute;ir don Aire a dearcadh ar mholta&iacute;  Thuairisc Bain a shoil&eacute;iri&uacute;.

		    <p class="B3BodyText">To conclude, without a clear policy, we are in danger of  going astray.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I call on the Minister to publish her Department&rsquo;s  sustainable schools policy without further delay. Go raibh c&eacute;ad maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ar dt&uacute;s, ba mhaith liom mo  bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il le Sammy Wilson as deis a thabhairt d&uacute;inn labhairt ar  cheist na Gaeilge inniu. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members might get a  bit of an education today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is part of a campaign waged against both the  Minister and Sinn F&eacute;in since the Department of Education was allocated. There  is an orchestrated campaign, led by the Chairperson of the Education Committee,  Sammy Wilson, and other Members of the DUP and the UUP on that Committee. That  campaign is a political witch-hunt against Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane. Shamefully, those  involved all sit on the Education Committee, and should therefore be working  with and supporting the Minister, and trying to deal with the complex issues  that face all of us in the education sector. Instead, those people within  unionism are using the education of our children as a political football.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The attacks on the  Minister have been relentless over the  last number of months, and the number of questions submitted to the  Department of Education is a clear example of an orchestrated campaign. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Members should not speak from a sitting position.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Can Members stand up and challenge the Member?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: If Members wish to ask whether the Member will give way, or if they  have a point of order, they may speak.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  As I was saying &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  No, I am not giving way. Nearly 400 questions have been submitted to the  Department of Education since Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane became Minister of Education.  That is more than the total combined number of questions received by the  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment; the Department of Finance and Personnel; and the Department for  Employ&shy;ment and Learning. That illustrates the campaign to try to undermine Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane as Minister of  Education. The motion is yet another example of that campaign.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In short, this is a political point-scoring exercise.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">N&iacute;l an r&uacute;n seo ach ag iarraidh a bheith ag sc&oacute;r&aacute;il point&iacute;  polait&iacute;ochta.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is dressed up  as concern for the education of children, but it is really &mdash; and this is  the heart of the matter &mdash; an attack on the Irish-medium education sector. The manner in which the DUP is playing  politics with the issue of the  provision of schools, and its attacks on Irish-language schools in  particular, is appalling. The recent comments of Michelle McIlveen, who called  on the Catholic sector, the Irish-medium sector and the integrated sector to be  disbanded and replaced by controlled  schools, were disgraceful. Those comments were a calculated insult to  the children, teachers and parents involved in those sectors.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  No. The DUP has a long way to go in reassuring professionals in the education  system that it is serious about addressing the many challenges that lie ahead,  and that it can &mdash; through the necessary reforms &mdash; bring the education system to  a point where it matches the entitlement of parents and children to choose a  form of schooling, as guaranteed under the Good Friday Agreement. The motion is  a particular attack on Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane because she opened three Gaelscoileanna  &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that if they have a question to ask &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  The Member will not give way.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: If the Member does not wish to give way, he does not have to. If  Members wish to speak, they must put their names down. Do not speak from a  sitting position.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us take away all the alarmist scaremongering that has  been purported today &mdash; and in past weeks &mdash; and look at the facts about  Irish-medium education. The Education (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 placed  a duty on the Department of Education to encourage and facilitate the  development of Irish-medium education. The European Charter for Regional or  Minority Languages, which the British Government signed up to, obliges the  Department of Education to provide Irish-medium education to those families who  request it, provided that there are sufficient numbers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been an increase in demand in the Irish-medium  sector. In the 1980s, parents had to travel the length and breadth of the  country to buy bricks to build their schools. In those days, there were 400 children  being educated in the Irish-medium sector; that number has increased to almost  3,000.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I tried to understand the difference between  the amendment and the motion, but, regrettably, I cannot accept the  amendment &mdash; although I agree with my colleague&rsquo;s sentiments. The implication of  the amendment is that if the Department published its views, they would be the  same as those of the Minister. However, that is clearly not the case. On such  issues as early-years provision and school closures, the Minister is on a solo  run. She is interested only in the things that she is interested in. Many  people in Lagan Valley are worried sick about their  schools and their children, as Paul Butler said. It is not a political football  as far as they are concerned: it is a tragedy, and nobody appears to be doing  anything about it. The Assembly must do something about it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It was suggested that getting rid of the 11-plus would  reduce stress. The current situation, where nobody knows what is going on, is  ten times worse than anything we ever had with the 11-plus. The pupils, and  their parents waiting outside, are suffering confusion, fear and stress. People  want to know what is going on. Some year 5 children in Lagan Valley  are sitting assessment tests again, just in case. When we look to the Minister  for guidance, we only get smiles and sweet words &mdash; &ldquo;I want to do the best for  you.&rdquo; Let us look at the decisions that she has made and at what she has done.  She has brought about muddle, confusion and countermanding. Only yesterday, the  Department of Education had to issue statements of clarification. Why did she  open three new schools and close one? One might look through the Bain Report  and try to work out what is going on. Why is she dealing with those issues and  not dealing with the bigger issues? When will academic selection, Irish-medium  education, early-years provision, and so forth, be dealt with?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s approach comes across &mdash; perhaps unintentionally &mdash; as arrogant, perhaps even  provocative. It does not encourage engagement, co-operation or buy-in  from the Assembly, and she will need those things if we are to tackle the real  challenges that face our education system. Perhaps there has been a  misunderstanding. I often hear the Minister say that she will meet the  Committee and listen to what its members have to say, and the Chairman of the  Committee will confirm that. I heard it at the Belfast F&aacute;ilte, but &mdash; and there  is always a but &mdash; when she has heard what we have to say, she will go ahead and  do whatever she was going to do anyway. That is the real issue, and it is not a  winning strategy. Her approach shows a lack of confidence, and it suggests an  inability to make a coherent or cogent argument. It has profound implications  for how the Assembly will work in the future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are hard decisions to be made, and those decisions  can only be made if consensus is built. The place to make those decisions is in  this Chamber. The Minister should bring these issues to the House and let  Members discuss them separately so that we can reach some sort of consensus.  The solo business does not do anyone any favours. Instead of having these nice  &mdash; albeit unstructured &mdash; debates on Mondays and Tuesdays in which Members table  motions on subjects that they think are important, we should get down to  business. When will the Minister bring to the Chamber a discussion on the value  of the Irish-medium sector? Let Members talk about it. If she can convince us  that it is the right way forward, let us do it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When are we going to talk about academic selection? The  Minister takes the views of everyone else in the world, but she does not talk  to elected representatives. The Assembly is at the very heart of the process of  getting people to buy into &mdash; and move forward on &mdash; policies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am quite sure that some of my colleagues will ask serious  questions, but I want to know why we are investing in a strategy that does no  good for anyone. Can we please have a proper debate?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I fear I am going to reduce the temperature slightly. The  Alliance Party supports the amendment. We would like the Minister to clarify  her approach to the recommendations of the Bain Report, and to give her  reaction to the consultation process on sustainable schools, which closed in  April. The Alliance Party does not particularly share the concerns expressed in  the motion about the specific decisions made during the summer recess.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP motion mentions amalgamations, and we would be  interested to hear the Minister state when she will outline her views on  possible mergers between controlled and maintained schools &mdash; that being the  obvious solution in areas of small population, such as Ahoghill, where, as has  been mentioned, an integrated school has effectively been created. I shall read  a couple of lines from the consultation document &lsquo;Consultation on Schools for  the Future: A Policy for Sustainable Schools&rsquo;:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In decision-making on new schools or  re-organisation/rationalisation of schools, proposals will be required to  demonstrate that options for collaboration/sharing on a cross-community basis  have been considered and fully explored&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps that would have sorted out the situation in  Ahoghill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Since I have mentioned integrated schools, how would the  Minister answer the concerns of parents who wish to see their children educated  in a genuinely integrated environment, but find their wishes frustrated by the  decisions of the Department of Education? I am thinking of Saintfield, where an  integrated school is now operating, but  with private funding, and Ballycastle, where a group of determined  parents refused to accept the Department&rsquo;s view and opened an integrated  primary school with funding obtained internationally, leading to the decision  by the local controlled primary school to apply for integrated status a couple  of years later. That is a good example of people power, and perhaps of  departmental misjudgement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As a party, Alliance  favours parental choice, whether it is expressed as a desire for Irish-language  schooling or integrated schooling. However, the real contrast for us &mdash; and I  would like the Minister&rsquo;s views on this &mdash; is between the apparent ease of  obtaining funding for the Irish-language sector, despite its minority appeal,  and the integrated sector, where every poll has shown it has overwhelming  support, but where parents frequently have to resort to sourcing independent  funding, despite satisfying the criteria laid down by the Department.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Clarification is also needed on the desirability of  cross-sectoral solutions, and whether the Minister is comfortable with individual  sectors continuing to make their own decisions, for example, those decisions that were recently announced by the Council for  Catholic Maintained Schools, and the grammar schools that are now  threatening to hold their own transfer tests.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment calls for clarification, as does the motion.  I appreciate the need for Ministers to take some time over difficult decisions,  but there is growing unease among parents, school boards and the teaching  professionals about the slow pace of progress. I hope that the Minister can  give us that clarification in the near future.</p>
		    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  The motion is not concerned with a political witch-hunt, as has been suggested  by one member of the Education Committee. The motion is aimed at ensuring that  the truth is told and that we have an accountable Minister of Education, who  tells us exactly what is happening for the good of our education system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The previous devolved Minister of Education, in his last  act as Minister &mdash; just about the last act of that Assembly &mdash; took the  ideological axe to our education system in what was nothing less than an act of  educational vandalism.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The current Minister displays all the symptoms of having  contracted the same disease. No doubt she got her formative training in policy  formulation and departmental responsibility and accountability amid the jungles  of Central America, where she went to the  assistance of other educators &mdash; those who were apprehended educating the  narcoterrorists of FARC. However, we were chasing butterflies when that was  brought to light. Her party leader clearly felt that on the back of that she  was obviously highly qualified to be the Minister of Education and easily  trusted to do what is best for all our children. Being as sympathetic to our  hatchling Minister as possible &mdash; even though she has such wide experience among  the Colombian undergrowth &mdash; I realise that her predecessor in the Department  left her a mess, and that she has inherited several huge difficulties,  including the transfer system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We still have a Minister who does not know what she is  doing about the transfer system. I concur with the Member for Lagan Valley Mr B  McCrea regarding the stress, the worry, the anxiety and the fear, but does the  Minister care? Has she compassion or concern? Yes &mdash; from the lips out, but  certainly not from the heart. The Minister has already amassed a significant  number of closure announcements for primary and secondary schools in the  controlled sector, as has already been  referred to. However, her position on CCMS and Irish-medium schools suggests that the Department is  following a different strategy.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  do not have much time.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want the Minister to come clean once and for all on the existing policy and to confirm that her  Department is pursuing a policy of amalgamating Catholic main&shy;tained  schools to protect their ethos, while enforcing systematic closure on the  controlled sector if it does not conform to switching into the integrated  sector. If that is so, it is a form of social and cultural engineering which  highlights an inconsistency in the principles of equality and parity so often  embraced and spoken of by the Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister announced the amalgamation of the two  maintained primary schools, St Joseph&rsquo;s and St  Patrick&rsquo;s, in my constituency of North Antrim.  The Minister has written off a deficit of &pound;300,000, but it is only money &mdash; what  about it? The Minister of Finance and Personnel will probably get the blame for  not giving her enough money, and she will pass the buck and the blame. The buck  and the blame stop with the Minister. The decision was made despite the total  opposition of the North Eastern Education and Library Board. The Minister has  decided to stick to the old republican motto, &ldquo;Herself alone&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Minterburn Primary School in Caledon, South Tyrone, was closed recently &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The Member knows that Caledon  is in my constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone. However, I am sure that he  does not know of another small school, Carntall Primary School,  which has a capacity of 86 pupils. The Department of Education has put a cap on  that figure. However, that school is under threat of closure from that  Department. Where is the equality in that? The school cannot have more than 86  pupils, and yet it will be closed because it is a controlled primary school.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Member for her intervention. She is absolutely right. I have a school  in my constituency accumulating a deficit year on year, but the CCMS has taken  no action on the future of that school. It is allowed to stay in existence  because of the policies of the Minister. What is happening to the controlled  sector? What is happening to our education system under this Minister? She has  picked up the baton handed to her by the  previous Minister of Education and is wielding it like a sword on the  controlled sector. The facts show it &mdash; despite the Minister&rsquo;s mantra about  equality. She seems to be applying the term liberally when dealing with the  controlled sector. Her Department appears to  be bowing to a different pressure when dealing with the CCMS. I call on  the Minister to address urgently the perception and the reality within the  Protestant community that proves that it is wrong.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Even the Minister&rsquo;s own party does not accept what she is  doing. Daith&iacute; McKay, the Sinn F&eacute;in Member for North Antrim,  criticised the Ahoghill decision. He said that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;there is no doubt that the amalgamation of those two  schools had been handled very badly. It is a disgrace &hellip; there is still a lack  of clarity &hellip; on the matter &hellip; it is essential that parents are kept fully  involved in any consultation&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The blame lies with the Minister. I support the  motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members who take an intervention, especially those  with five minutes or less to speak, that they will get an extra minute added to  their time. That has always been the protocol in the House.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I support the amendment. However, I wonder whether we would be having this  debate if the decision that the Minister took during recess applied to the  controlled sector.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an increase in demand for Irish-medium education  and integrated education in spite of the fact that there has been an overall  reduction in the school-age population. The Irish-medium education sector is in  a healthy state, and Members should welcome that. We should also fully respect  the right of parents to choose to have their children educated in that sector  and the right of teachers to teach in the sector. There are almost eight times  as many children in Irish-medium education as there were in 1991. Parents are  exercising their right to request Irish-medium education for their children.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is provision under the European Charter for Regional  or Minority Languages, when families request it and numbers are sufficient, for  education to be made available in Irish. They are also protected &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Not at the minute.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">They are also protected by the commitment made in the Good  Friday Agreement, which led to a duty being placed:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;On the Department of Education to encourage and facilitate  Irish medium education&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That was reiterated in the St Andrews Agreement,  which the DUP signed up to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish language is the native language of this country.  It has been a spoken language for nearly 2,000 years and is of great importance to the people in relation to  their cultural identity and their roots. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  When the Member made the point that the Irish language is part of our shared  cultural heritage, the Members opposite burst into guffaws and ridicule. I wish  to make the point to those Members that there is an audience paying attention.  Do we address the lowest common denominator of intolerance, bigotry and  prejudice? Members should seriously and responsibly question whether their  approach is helpful.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  What about our culture, and recognising it?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Absolutely. Members should accept that we have all benefited from the different  cultural traditions that exist in our society &mdash; the Scots, the English and the  Huguenot, as well as the Gaelic. We should all celebrate diversity in the  community. There is a regrettable tone of intolerance and bigotry in the  comments that I have heard from across the Chamber. I wonder how that is seen  by our community.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>: I thank the member for his intervention.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish language does not belong to one section of the  community. It belongs to us all, and we should all take ownership of it and  promote our shared heritage. The Members on the opposite side of the House must  realise and accept that the Irish language is here to stay. It is growing in popularity, and whether the motion is  agreed today is irrelevant. The Irish language will continue to grow &mdash; that is  the reality. More and more parents are  choosing Irish as an option for their children.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The unionist parties must stop fearing it and stop trying  to score political points from it. The arguments are wearing thin. No-one will  be forced to learn Irish. It will be entirely a personal and voluntary  decision.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Not at the minute.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish language, as part of our heritage, poses no  threat to anyone. Comments made yesterday and today, such as those accusing the  Minister of Education of making decisions in  a most sectarian and unfair manner, serve only to scaremonger. It is the  same old rhetoric that has been heard from  Sammy Wilson and his cohorts for too  long. The comments are irresponsible on behalf of the Members who made  them and only serve to demoralise their own community and foment division.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The approach being adopted by the Minister to clarify the  way forward as regards the Bain Report and the sustainable schools policy is  correct. A measured decision, based on the welfare of children, must be at the  core. I support the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms McIlveen</strong>:  In Northern Ireland, we are  already faced with a higher proportion of small schools than in other areas of  the United Kingdom.  Although smaller class sizes undoubtedly have the advantage of greater pupil  engagement, there is the problem of different levels being taught together in  some rural schools. Therefore, some schools face difficulties and cannot be  supported because they are not cost-effective due to falling numbers and have  an adverse effect on the education of pupils due to the combining of classes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, in today&rsquo;s society we are faced with  economic realities; we cannot afford to allow a Minister to indulge her  prejudices and pet projects.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Education appears to be suffering from some  form of tunnel vision and can see only the needs of Irish-medium schools or,  more accurately, what she perceives as the  need for Irish-medium schools.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  A Member referred earlier to the right of parental choice. There was a debacle  in Londonderry; parents were denied the right  to send their children to their chosen schools, because other pupils obtained  places by using their grandparents&rsquo; addresses. Now is an appropriate time to  ask the Minister to confirm or refute the allegation that she is abusing the  intake criteria by sending her children to school in Northern   Ireland, despite living in the Republic of Ireland.  Is she involved in the practice known as &ldquo;grannying&rdquo;?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms McIlveen</strong>:  There are 20 Irish-medium schools, which  cater for 2,530 pupils. The Minister has announced that we should be  &ldquo;bold and brave&rdquo; regarding Irish-medium education. What about the other 309,186  pupils in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  schools? The Minister is in denial about the reasons that the Irish-language  unit had to close at St Patrick&rsquo;s Primary School, as announced on 15 August  2007. Purely and simply, there was not enough demand. However, in the same  breath as announcing the closure, she told us that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;we need to plan more strategically for the provision  of Irish-Medium education&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">telling us that it is a &ldquo;growing sector&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Money should be spent more wisely. Supporting a  multiplicity of education sectors incurs unnecessary cost. While we hear  announcements of the closure or amalgamations of schools, we hear others about  the opening of Irish-medium schools. The Minister tells us in syrupy words  about her dreams of a shared future, but her actions tell us that she wants  more division and segregation.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member agree that the Minister is being partial in regard to that  issue, because her Department has failed to provide any funding for another sector? I, as a parent, chose to send my  children to an independent Christian school, but not one penny of  Government money goes to that school, which has more pupils than the school  that the Minister funded in the summer. Therefore, she is picky about the  schools that she funds, and she is not even aware that a particular sector  exists. I made a choice, as a parent, and I pay for that choice, because I am  conscious of the burden on Northern    Ireland taxpayers.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms McIlveen</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As we heard in a previous debate, there is often a need to  reiterate a point, so I will not apologise for repeating this example. So far  during her tenure, the Minister has announced a review of Irish-medium  education, approved funding for three Irish-medium primary schools and, at the  same time, has written off a deficit of nearly &pound;300,000 in the amalgamation of St Joseph&rsquo;s Primary  School and St Patrick&rsquo;s Primary School in Ahoghill. As there is protection for  teachers, there will be a further &pound;200,000 deficit. Yet, if we ignore the  &pound;500,000 loss, the number of pupils at the new school still does not meet the  recommendations set out in the Bain Report.  It appears that the Minister&rsquo;s policy is spend, spend, spend.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In response to a question from Mr Neeson yesterday, the  Minister accepted that it was not in the best interests of pupils to have 20 or  30 pupils in a school. Yet, in response to the next question from Dr McCrea, she attempted to justify, using  unsubstantiated, projected figures, opening an Irish-medium school with  12 pupils.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Is it not time that the  Minister focused on the existing education structure and stopped  cherry-picking from the Bain Report in an attempt to shore up her sectarian  agenda? The cost of propagating that agenda cannot be justified when we  consider the motion that came before the Assembly on 29 May this year regarding  a revised literacy and numeracy strategy. Where are the press statements to  address that pressing problem, which affects Northern Ireland as a whole?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During that debate, I called for the Minister to be strong and show effective leadership to her  Department. However, all I have seen is dithering and her aspirations  for cultural segregation. Her Department&rsquo;s sustainable schools policy says that  over the years:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;there has been a lack of a consistent planning  framework.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It appears that the Minister is following in the  footsteps of her predecessors.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is time for the Minister to show an even-handed approach  to the challenges that face education in Northern Ireland. I support the  motion, and I call on the Minister to  provide the House with a comprehensive, reasoned and well-balanced  policy to deal with the recommendations of  the Bain Report and the sustainable schools policy. It is time for the  Minister to be bold and brave, to set aside her personal agenda and work for  all the people of Northern    Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I thank the Member who proposed this important motion. I am speaking in a  personal capacity as a member of the Ulster Unionist Party and not as the  Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and the  Deputy First Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I address my remarks to the section of the motion that  refers to:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;decisions taken by the Minister of Education over the  summer recess&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I particularly want to scrutinise her decision to approve  the development proposals for four Irish-medium schools. I want to try to gain  an understanding of the rationale as to why those decisions continue to be  made. There appear to be political, as opposed to educational, reasons for  those decisions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have to confess that I have a limited understanding of  the Irish language, in spite of the fact that I was brought up, and still live,  in a nationalist/republican area. My great-grandfather, Jones Black, was a  fluent Irish speaker. However, somewhere along the line, the family sorted that  out &mdash; that tradition no longer exists.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not interested in the Irish language. Those who wish  to pursue it have a perfect right to do so, which I accept. Some Members speak  Irish fluently; Mr Dominic Bradley speaks fluently and eloquently &mdash; one  presumes. However, there are others in the Chamber who speak what might be  regarded as &ldquo;prison Gaelic&rdquo;. I am not sure that that generally benefits the  language. The lesson is that people should stop using the language as a  political tool. It is an entirely different matter if people choose to harness  the language as an educational asset.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What is the rationale behind Gaelic being taught primarily  in an exclusive setting &mdash; that is, Irish-medium schools in one sector? It  strikes me that Irish is adequately dealt with, and taught, in the maintained  sector. I have no doubt that there is increasing room in the maintained sector  to improve facilities and give a better and more rounded education &mdash; not only  in Irish but in various subjects &mdash; to children and parents who express that interest.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not convinced that teaching children Gaelic gives them  a competitive advantage for the future. It does not produce better doctors,  engineers or software developers for society. Over 25% of the world&rsquo;s  population can communicate, to some extent, in English. English is the common  language in almost every sphere &mdash; from science to air traffic control. Irish  has a limited national or international appeal. Although there may be more  native speakers of Chinese or Spanish, English is the language that people use  across the world and across cultures.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The money that is being expended to provide Irish-medium  education in an exclusive Irish setting &mdash; largely for political reasons &mdash; must  be closely considered. It is unjustified, and it cannot be defended. I wish  that we could move on to a more sensible debate in which the rationale for  those decisions could be examined objectively and reviewed sincerely.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I was interested by the comments made on the motion by both Paul Butler and  Michelle O&rsquo;Neill. I must pick up on those of Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, who told us that  the Irish language is no threat to anyone. Despite her extensive studies on  this matter, she obviously has not read the official Sinn F&eacute;in party  publication that tells us that every single word that is spoken in Irish is  another bullet in the struggle for freedom. Sinn F&eacute;in was responsible for that  publication &mdash; it bears the Sinn F&eacute;in badge and it has that party&rsquo;s imprimatur.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I do not have time to give way &mdash; I assure Members that I have a lot to get  through. I will give way some other time.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It would be helpful if Michelle O&rsquo;Neill and other Sinn F&eacute;in  Members would explain how something presented by her party in military terms is  no threat to anyone. Her understanding of the European Charter for Regional and  Minority Languages &mdash; and, I might also add, of the UN Convention on the Rights  of the Child &mdash; is very different from my understanding of them. One of the core  principles of those documents is equality. That is a point that I wish to  stress; for me, it is a core issue in this debate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in constantly presents itself as pursuing an  equality agenda. &ldquo;Equality&rdquo; is one of those words that appears in almost every Sinn F&eacute;in speech and publication. Sinn  F&eacute;in Members say that they demand it, but the truth is that Sinn F&eacute;in does not  want, and cannot cope with, equality. What Sinn F&eacute;in Members really want is preferential treatment for their community, their  culture and their pet projects. They want inequality in favour of  themselves, and institutionalised discrimination in favour of their position.  All their talk about equality is simply a sham  and a fraud. The truth is that the decisions made by the Minister were  shameful and sectarian.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I warmly welcome the proposal, made by Basil McCrea, that  the Assembly debate the Irish-medium sector, which needs to be scrutinised,  and, if it were scrutinised, a lot more might come out than is already known.  It would be good to debate that at the earliest opportunity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members should take note of the following: the Belfast  Education and Library Board, of which I am a member, is under pressure from the  Minister&rsquo;s Department to review and rationalise controlled school provision in  the city because of the number of empty school places. Belfast Education and  Library Board is not unique in that; the CCMS is also implementing a programme  of rationalisation, particularly in the west of the city. In Belfast,  schools have an enrolment of 120 or more pupils, so that if one amalgamates two  Belfast  schools, one creates a single school of 250 to 270 pupils. Those schools are  being put under pressure to amalgamate, while the Minister creates a school of  just 43 pupils in one case, and of just 12 in another.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That matter was discussed at a meeting of the education  committee of the Belfast Education and Library Board last Thursday. No one from  Sinn F&eacute;in bothered to turn up. All those present discussed the matter and there  was complete unanimity on the matter. Even members of the SDLP who were present  supported my proposal that we should ask the board to approach the Association  of Education and Library Boards to seek a judicial review of what the Minister  has done, so that she is scrutinised, not merely by this House, but by the  British courts.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is a woman  who has taken a great interest over the years in the court system, so  she will welcome the opportunity to be taken to court on this matter. We need a  judicial review of this decision, and I hope that my proposal is approved by the full Belfast Education and  Library Board and by the Association of Education and Library Boards.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What the Minister has done shows that she does not view the  situation in a fair and impartial way. It was done in a partisan way to further  the sectarian agenda of Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat. We have heard from Members on  issues regarding the opening and amalgamation of schools, the Bain Report, and  sustainable schools. I will respond to as many of the points as possible, and  explain the position on decisions taken in individual cases, as well as the  overall position, as set out in the Bain Report and &lsquo;Schools for the Future: a  Policy for Sustainable Schools&rsquo;, published by the direct rule Administration.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Before that, I will respond to Iris Robinson&rsquo;s question,  although it was unfair. We are all politicians in this House, and we should not  involve each others&rsquo; children in the choices that we make. Given that Mrs  Robinson has brought my children into the debate, I will explain my situation.  I use my home address in north Louth for my two children, who go to school in  the North of Ireland. I make no apology for that, because I believe that  children should be able to go to their nearest school, no matter where they  live in relation to the border. If Members are serious about changing the  education system, and dealing with demographic decline we must examine how  issues around the border are dealt with. I am aware that there is a judicial  review around the issue of &ldquo;grannying&rdquo; and I will await the court&rsquo;s ruling on  that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">European legislation is in place regarding the many people, right across the island, particularly in  the border communities, who live in the South, and work and pay taxes in  the North. What I ask &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Please Iris, there is no need to be rude, I did not  interrupt you. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order Members, the Minister has the Floor.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: We  should not bring each other&rsquo;s children into our political debates.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Members should address their remarks through the Chair. The Minister has  the Floor.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  The Independent Strategic Review of Education, or the Bain Report, examined  issues of school funding, planning, collaboration and sharing. Published at the  end of last year, the report contains 61 recommendations and focuses on the  quality of education for children. It  recommends that there should be an estate of fewer, but larger, schools,  with greater collaboration and sharing, in  and across school sectors, in order to address the needs of children in  local areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the general thrust of the Bain Report, and the  objective of providing modern schools that are fit for purpose and provide a  high-quality education for all children.  Nevertheless, many of the recommendations require further detailed work and consultation. It would not be  possible to implement the report overnight.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Since taking up the post of Minister of Education, I have  had many meetings with school representatives and interest groups across the  education sector, who have raised aspects of the Bain Report. I know that the  issues are important to the education sector and need to be dealt with fully  and carefully. Implementation must be taken forward in consultation. It is essential  that the Department of Education gets the detail correct because children&rsquo;s  long-term educational interests are at the heart of such work.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bain Report  recommended that provision should move to a system of schools that are  educationally and financially viable in the long term, and planned on an area  basis.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Cuideoidh seo le fadhbanna an r&oacute;-shol&aacute;thair a laghd&uacute; i  dtr&eacute;imhse athruithe m&oacute;ra sa l&iacute;on dalta&iacute; agus lena chinnti&uacute; go bhfuil na  scoileanna ag comhphobail at&aacute; de dh&iacute;th orthu.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Around half of the recommendations in the Bain Report  relate directly to the improved planning of schools on an area basis. The  report recommends that there should be a more strategic approach, with greater  consistency and coherence in planning. There has been a general recognition  across the education sector that an area-based planning approach should be  introduced. That would have an important role in supporting our wider  educational policies and raising the equality of education. The relation  between schools and further education provision will also be a key  consideration in improved planning and collaboration.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The need to provide a system of strong, viable schools is  at the heart of area-based planning. The Bain Report recommended that a policy  on sustainable schools be produced. To that end, my Department has been  analysing the responses from the consultation that took place earlier in 2007.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft policy document on sustainable schools proposes  the same enrolment thresholds as the Bain Report suggested: 105 for rural  primary schools; 140 for urban primary schools; and 500 for post-primary  schools that have pupils who are aged 11 to 16 years. Concerns have been raised about those levels; however, the Bain  Report did not say that schools that are below those levels need to be  rationalised automatically. Instead, schools that are in that position are to  be reviewed to see whether they continue to provide quality education.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Enrolment levels are only one of a proposed set of six  criteria by which to assess school viability. The proposed criteria also  include: the educational experience of the children; the school&rsquo;s financial  position; leadership and management of the school; the school&rsquo;s accessibility; and its links with the community. The core objective of the policy is high-quality  education for children regardless of  where they live. Often, concerns about a school&rsquo;s viability are raised  only when enrol&shy;ments have fallen  irreversibly. The criteria and indicators in the policy are intended to  provide a framework for early consideration and possible remedial action.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department received 119 responses to &lsquo;A Consultation on  Schools for the Future: A Policy for Sustainable Schools&rsquo;. The document and the  responses raise complex questions about a school&rsquo;s viability. Overall, however, there is an interest in having  a clearly set-out approach to viability. That will help to shape our  education system for the future. The responses deserve the most careful  consideration so that the policy can be clearly articulated for the future. I  intend to introduce proposals towards the end of the year.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion refers to openings and amalgamation decisions. I  want to turn to the processes that are involved, because it is obvious from  many Members&rsquo; contributions that they do not understand those processes. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I did not interrupt  Members during their contributions; I would appreciate it if they did  not interrupt me.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a statutory requirement for a development proposal  to be published when a school is being established, is closed or is undergoing  a significant change that alters its character or size. Proposals can be  initiated by the local education and library board, the Catholic Council for  Maintained Schools, the Council for Integrated Education, Comhairle na  Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, an individual school or any other interested parties. However,  it is important to remember that I do not initiate the proposals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposals that have been highlighted in the debate were  initiated by parents&rsquo; groups, in the case of the opening of the new  Irish-medium schools, and by the CCMS, which acted on behalf of the trustees,  in the case of the amalgamation of maintained schools. The closure of Minterburn Primary School has also been raised, and  that closure was proposed by the Southern Education and Library Board.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Before a proposal is  published, the relevant education and library board is required to  consult with any school that it may affect. There is also a statutory duty on  the proposer to consult with governors and teachers of any schools that are the  subject of the proposal, as well as with parents. Following publication of the  proposal, there is statutory period of two months during which representations  can be made to the Department in support of or against a proposal. At the end  of those two months, the Department evaluates all relevant information about  the proposal.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Education considers demands for all forms  of education, including Irish-medium and integrated education, within the  general framework that is set out in the  Education and Libraries Order 1986. That  states that so far as is compatible with the provision of efficient  instruction and training and the avoidance of unreasonable public expenditure,  children will be educated in accordance  with the wishes of their parents.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Following a commitment that was made in the Belfast  Agreement, the Education Order 1998 placed a duty on the Department to  encourage and facilitate the development of Irish-medium education.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  will not give way.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the British Government have signed the  European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which came into force in  July 2001.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The charter provides that where families request, and where  there is a sufficient number of potential pupils, education will be made  available in Irish. The Bain Report identified a significant growth in recent  years in the number of pupils being educated through the medium of Irish. There  are currently over 3,000 pupils in Irish-medium education, compared to an  earlier figure of fewer than 400. I have the Bain Report here. I had a meeting  with George Bain last week. I urge people to read the Bain Report; it is  obvious that some people have not. I quote:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In view of the pattern of growth in the sector, the  issues that need to be considered, and a radically changing planning context  for education, the Review recommends that DE should develop a comprehensive and  coherent policy for IM education.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is exactly what my  Department and I are doing. It is interesting that when we discuss the  issue of Irish-medium education, the temperature in the House rises. We are in new arrangements. Mitchel  McLaughlin made points that Members need to listen to. I do not want to  score points. We should not be having divisive debates like this in the House.  Michelle McIlveen talked about leadership; let us show leadership. I have seen  it in the communities and in schools, including controlled schools. I am  working &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Please do not interrupt me.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Order. The Minister has the Floor. I ask the Minister to address her comments through the  Chair.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: My  apologies. OK.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The educators are way ahead of the political parties in the  unionist community. I say that from experience. I ask Members to put division  behind them and move forward on the basis of equality. I take equality very seriously, as Members know. I have invited the  Equality Coalition to have a  discussion and to brief all my officials on all the issues relating to  equality. I invite all the other Departments to follow my lead in that matter.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, I discussed with George Bain his report and its  conclusions on Irish-medium provision. As someone who has experienced  bilingualism in his native Canada,  George Bain was well aware of the issues that can arise. That is why he  recommended that there should be a review of Irish-medium education. In  considering the development proposals of the three &mdash; not four &mdash; Irish-medium  schools, Gaelscoil &Eacute;anna, Gaelscoil Ghleann Darach and Gaelscoil na Dar&oacute;ige, I  took careful account of the individual circumstances.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I took careful account of the views of Comhairle na  Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, the body funded by the Department to encourage and facilitate  the development of Irish-medium education. I considered that in each case there  would be sufficient demand for Irish-medium primary-school provision in the  respective areas. Members are playing with figures. They need to understand  that in each of those schools, there are 12-15 pupils in primary 1, not the  whole school. Members are not comparing like with like.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The granting of conditional approval entitles a school to  recurrent funding only. The position is reviewed after three years to confirm  whether viability is expected to be sustainable. In each of those schools, there is pre-school provision in the medium of  Irish with, already, sufficient numbers for the next two years. A  school&rsquo;s eligibility for capital funding is assessed at the end of that  three-year period, and pupil intake levels are relevant to that assessment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A successful amalgamation of schools should realise  important benefits, including a reduction in the number of surplus places, a reduction in the pressure on teachers in  their delivery of the curriculum, and better use of resources. Many positive amalgamations are happening.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The criteria for assessing proposals for new Irish-medium  schools are no different from those for other sectors. The minimum intakes  required to ensure a viable school over the long term are in line with the Bain  Report&rsquo;s views on the viability of primary schools. It is inevitable that new  schools will start small but are expected to grow. There has been undue and  unfair focus on the three Irish-medium schools that I approved for funding. It  is worth making the point that Irish is for all communities, not just one  community. In light of the fact that there has been that undue focus, I should  like to wish those schools well and assure them that we will not allow them to  become political footballs. That would not be fair.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Demand for the Irish-medium sector and the integrated  sector is growing in an education sector in which overall numbers are falling.  In every proposal, I will examine individual circumstances. In regard to  proposals for closures or amalgamations &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Minister&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I want to refer to the important points that my colleague Dominic Bradley made.  He mentioned first the duty on the Department to provide a policy to guide  practice. He also told us that we need clear policies to ensure an even-handed  approach towards all sectors, according to their needs. We need policy to bring clarity and transparency to the  situation, and Dominic Bradley pointed out that so much in the reforms  depends on a workable sustainable schools policy. The planning of the schools  estate under area planning cannot be implemented without that policy. He  mentioned that the Department plans to begin the movement towards reform  through a programme of convergence of the education and library boards with the soon-to-be-established education and skills  authority.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, Mr Bradley reminded us that we are setting out on  a road and that none of us knows where we are going without the policy  signposts that should be guiding us along the way. One of the main policy signposts  is the sustainable schools policy. Again, so many of the RPA reforms depend on  that policy. I agree that policy drives practice, and the fact that many  policies, including &lsquo;Schools for the Future: A Policy for Sustainable Schools&rsquo;,  are not yet in place is not acceptable after 21 months of preparation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The previous Minister  accepted the Bain recommend&shy;ations in full, and our current Minister has  indicated that she accepts the Bain Report in principle, but clarification is needed as to which recommendations will now be  subject to further discussion or change. In my view, quite a few issues  require clarification in an updated policy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bain Report figures  for minimum pupil numbers were 115 pupils for a primary school, 500 pupils  for post-primary schools for 11- to 16-year-olds, and 100 pupils for sixth-form  provision. However, those were not set as  minimum thresholds for retention, but as review thresholds. I would like  the Minister&rsquo;s view on that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bain Report also refers to schools having composite  classes with no more than two year groups per class. That equates to four  teachers, and with the current average  pupil:teacher ratio and local management of schools arrangements in  primary schools, would allow primary schools to function with 80 pupils. What  is the Minister&rsquo;s view of that? I do not know. Does she know? We have no way of  knowing without the policy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also a significant number of schools with 55 to 60  pupils and three teachers. Although those schools require additional support  for the significant challenges that they  face, in the main, they are financially and educationally viable, and an  option for their retention should be available. Does the Minister agree?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposal to merge  two small schools in Ahoghill also sits well below the Bain Report  numbers, but the report also points out that sustainable schools policy must  take account of the need of communities, whether they are rural communities or  those that represent a single sector in an area in which that population is in  the minority. There will always be the need to retain a few schools that sit  outside any recommended figures, and the policy should accommodate those  exceptions. Again, the issue is the urgent need for a sustainable schools  policy to be adopted and operational.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Since the consultation on &lsquo;Schools for the Future: A Policy  for Sustainable Schools&rsquo; before the summer, no approved policy has as yet emerged. That policy vacuum means  that proposals and subsequent decisions are being made, at best, on the basis  of an outdated policy and will cause disagreement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We need the clarification and consistent direction of guiding policy. For that reason, I call on all  Members to support the amendment and  to ensure that the sustainable schools policy is published without  further delay.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  Let me say at the outset that the DUP rejects the SDLP amendment. Quite  frankly, it does not hold the Minister to account on the decisions that have  been taken over the summer. It is a fudge. It is the political equivalent of  being mauled by a dead sheep, as we once famously heard in the House of  Commons. What does the amendment do?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It simply asks the Minister to publish her intentions. The  Minister must do that, but in the context &mdash; ignored by the SDLP &mdash; of the  widespread concern in the community about the nature of the decisions taken in  the summer.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  No, I will not give way. In response to &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member had his chance earlier and he did not have much  to say, so he will not add anything now.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of Mr Butler&rsquo;s &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  In response to the nonsense we heard from Paul Butler about witch hunts, I was  not aware that there was a witch to be hunted; maybe he knows something that we  do not. Michelle O&rsquo;Neill and Paul Butler were at the Committee for Education  when it decided to write to the Minister with concerns about her decisions, but  neither of them raised an objection. They said absolutely nothing. There was  consensus in the Committee, so what is going on this afternoon? Is there a Whip  being applied, I wonder?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This is about democracy, and holding the Minister to  account. That is what we are doing on this side of the Chamber &mdash; holding the  Minister to account. It is not about witch hunts; it is simply about addressing  some very real concerns? What are those concerns? As a Member for Lagan Valley,  Mr Butler should know what they are. He knows that four small rural schools  were closed in my constituency this summer: Hillhall  Primary School; Lambeg  Primary School; Charley  Memorial Primary School;  and Drumbo Primary School. Yet, in the same  breath, the Minister took the decision to amalgamate two primary schools in  Ahoghill. The combined enrolment of those two schools of 43 pupils is less than  that of Hillhall Primary School, one of the four schools  that the Minister closed this summer in my constituency. Four rural schools  have been closed, and yet, the combined enrolment of those schools would come  to almost 100 pupils. Why did they not have the option of amalgamation? It is  because they were controlled schools.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The schools in Ahoghill that were amalgamated were maintained schools. With the greatest  respect to the Minister, the message that people in my constituency get  is that controlled schools are &ldquo;fair game under Bain&rdquo;, whereas those in the  maintained, Irish-medium or integrated sectors are a preserved and protected  species. That is the message that is coming through loud and clear from the  Minister&rsquo;s decisions.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  On a point of order. Is it in order for a Member who was not in the Chamber for  the full duration of the debate to make the winding-up speech?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That is not a point of order. Mr Donaldson has the Floor.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  I have heard enough from the hon Member opposite to know a wind-up when I hear  one.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Five years ago, the previous Sinn F&eacute;in Minister of  Education, now the Deputy First Minister, grant-aided several Irish-medium schools,  and predicted that they would all reach enrolments in excess of 105 pupils.  Yet, of the 18 Irish-medium schools that exist today, half are nowhere near  meeting the enrolment target of 105 pupils. In fact, &lsquo;Schools for the Future:  Funding, Strategy, Sharing&rsquo;, published in December 2006, states that numbers in  those schools range from just 18 pupils &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  A Cheann Comhairle. On a point of order. Is it in order for a Member to use a  book in the fashion of an exhibit?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Are you serious?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. If the Member is quoting from a book, he is entitled to use it in the  Chamber.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>: The truth is hitting home now all right.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order &mdash; that goes for every side of the House. Mr Donaldson has the Floor.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  The report makes clear that some of those schools have as few as 18 pupils. If  the then Minister of Education got enrolments so spectacularly wrong, what  prospect is there that the current Minister has correctly estimated the  enrolments of the three Irish-medium schools to which she gave approval earlier  this summer?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The question is one of confidence in the Minister&rsquo;s  decisions. I say to her sincerely that there are people that I represent in my  constituency who do not see fairness in the decisions that she made during the  summer. I am afraid that they see bias, and if that does not change, let me be  clear from these Benches, there will neither be consensus in the House, nor  cross-community support, for the kind of reforms that the Minister wants to  introduce.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister must demonstrate fairness and end bias, and  then we will start to listen. Only then will there be the prospect of some  consensus. However, as regards the big decisions that have to be taken, unless  we get a level playing field for all sectors, including the controlled sector,  the Minister will not achieve the kind of cross-community consensus that she  needs in order to make progress in educational reform.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP does not want children to be turned into political  footballs. The party wants children to be treated equally and fairly, whether  they are Protestant or Roman Catholic and whether they speak Irish, English or  any other language. The DUP is asking for fairness, but the decisions taken  this summer do not reflect fairness or impartiality, and that goes to the heart  of the matter.</p>

		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">I know that no amount of  sympathy extended to those</span> families, or any of the families and friends  bereaved by that type of sudden death, can comfort them. However, the assurance  that this House cares enough to do all in its power to establish a system of  screening that might help others to avoid the suffering that they are going  through may be of some consolation to them.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Cormac McAnallen and John McCall were sportsmen who might  have survived their conditions had they been detected early enough. That raises  an important issue that we, as a legislative Assembly, must try to address.  Young people who are not involved in sport also suffer from cardiac conditions,  and, unfortunately, die from them. So our efforts to detect and treat those  conditions must include all young people who may be at risk.</p>
		    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must take steps to prevent further deaths from cardiac  conditions, and that is why we are calling on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety and other Ministers in the Executive to put forward  options for a screening service to identify those at risk. The Minister&rsquo;s previous  comments in the Chamber, when he undertook to ask officials to look into  whether the screening of young athletes in Northern Ireland would be effective  and appropriate, were welcome. I ask him to extend that investigation to all  young people who may be at risk.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Before bringing this motion to the House today I spoke to  sports organisations that are also concerned about cardiac conditions. I am  very heartened by the forward thinking of, and proactive moves being taken by,  such organisations as the GAA, the Irish Football Association and Ulster Rugby  in engaging with issues like sudden adult death syndrome, through the charity  Cardiac Risk in the Young, in an attempt to try to deal with the problem, and  also taking their own measures.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important for us to reassure people that sport and  physical exercise are major contributors to the health of young people, and we  must support the sporting bodies in their efforts to involve as many young  people as possible. Those organisations have developed responsible coaching  programmes and approaches that are appropriate to the age and physical  development of participants.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to the families of victims &mdash; families like  the McAnallens and the McCalls &mdash; who have raised funds to provide vital  equipment. I also wish to acknowledge my neighbour Kathleen Mooney, who lost  her 18-year-old daughter, Mary, to a cardiac condition, and who has set up  &ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s Fund&rdquo; to help provide equipment like defibrillators to schools, youth  clubs and sports organisations. I acknowledge the work of groups like the  Cormac Trust in providing automated external defibrillators to communities in County Tyrone.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not believe that we should be leaving those initiatives solely to the families and sporting  organisations. We, in this House, have a duty to investigate all the  possibilities and to set up a system of screening that will complement, and  possibly encompass, existing efforts and help to reassure all parents.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Comprehensive screening does not necessarily mean a  widespread hospital-based screening programme for every young person in the  country. It is possible to narrow the target group for screening by methods  that are relatively inexpensive and already  in use in Northern<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> Ireland</span>,  the Republic of Ireland,  and England.  The Gaelic Athletic Association, for example, through its medical welfare  committee, recommends cardiac screening for all who participate in its games.  The first stage is the completion of a questionnaire on the individual player&rsquo;s  health and well-being. It uses a trigger system whereby anyone who has had a  family <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">member die before the  age of 50 from a heart condition</span>, or anyone who has ever felt dizzy or  had chest pains during physical exercise, is referred to their GP for a more  detailed screening.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">SADS, a UK  organisation that raises awareness about sudden arrhythmic death syndrome,  believes that young people should be invited to a doctor&rsquo;s surgery at the ages  of 11 and 15 to complete a questionnaire that gives information about their  personal and medical history, and their family&rsquo;s medical history. During that  visit, the GP would examine the patient with a stethoscope to try to detect any  heart murmur. That would be followed up with a questionnaire, to be completed  with parental assistance, to establish whether a child is in an at-risk group  or has suffered signs or symptoms consistent with a cardiac condition. Those are simple, but effective, ways to help to  identify those who may benefit from a more comprehensive screening  process and which may help us to use our resources to the best possible effect.  We can learn and co-operate with others within these shores and beyond. We can  share expertise and experience that could help us to shape a system that would  help to ensure that we identify and treat those at risk before it is too late.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It was with that in mind that Carmel Hanna and I tabled the  motion. The Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety and his  colleagues should engage the necessary advice from cardiology experts in Northern Ireland, call on expertise south of  the border and in other parts of the  United Kingdom, and introduce workable proposals that would help to  identify and treat young people with cardiac conditions through a screening  programme. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas &oacute; chro&iacute; leat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: Leave out all after the second  &ldquo;families&rdquo; and insert</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;who have lost loved ones in this way; and calls upon  the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, and the Executive,  to consult with their United Kingdom counterparts through the National  Screening Committee, and bring forward fully costed, evidence-based proposals  to reduce avoidable cardiac deaths in the young, including screening programmes  where appropriate.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of my party colleagues, I express my sincere  sympathies to the two families that have lost their precious sons. There can be  few things more tragic than the sudden death of a young person, which is made  all the more shocking in instances where the victim is seemingly active and  healthy, and perhaps even a successful athlete.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The time and effort that many young people in the Province  put into their sports is, to say the least, phenomenal. I was contacted  yesterday by a represent&shy;ative from the Rathgael Gymnastics and Trampolining  Club, which supports the finding of a means to reduce deaths from heart  defects, but it admitted that it was mindful of the likely costs involved.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Young gymnasts at the Rathgael club commit many hours each  week to training. For example, it currently <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">has  two 11-year-old girls who train 21 hours a week after</span> school; two  13-year-old girls who train 17&middot;25 hours a week;  two 10-year-old girls who train 17&middot;5 hours a week; <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">and two nine-year-old girls who train 13&middot;25 hours  a week</span>. The club also has a development squad, where girls as young as  six years of age train for 13 hours a week.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those children manage to fit in all that training while  managing homework and all the other activities in which they are involved. They  put in those hours in order to enhance the standards at which they compete, and  several of those girls compete at international level. They assume that if they  are putting in those training hours on behalf of their country, surely the  least that they can expect in return is that the Northern Ireland Government  resource preventative health services for them properly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In many other sports in Northern Ireland, young people are  also devoting long periods to training in the pursuit of excellence, often  unseen in the early hours of the morning while others remain in their beds.  Such is the commitment of our current ice-skating champions that they are in  training at Dundonald Ice Bowl at approximately 6.37 am, before they start  their school day.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">High-profile stories are  undoubtedly tragic. However, many other deaths also occur among those  who have not excelled to the same high level of excellence.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We want to do all that we can to limit the needless loss of  young life. The available resources must be carefully directed to ensure that  we obtain the maximum benefit from them. That is why Members must follow the  evidence of the experts and take heed of all of the research that has been  conducted.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Various practices have been adopted in different countries.  A report published in March 2006 in the Irish Republic, &lsquo;Reducing the Risk: A Strategic Approach&rsquo;,  by the Task Force on Sudden Cardiac Deaths stated:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The evidence is weak&hellip;Our understanding of the  diseases underlying SCD in athletes comes from autopsy studies.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sudden cardiac death rates are higher in those actively  involved in sport. The deaths are mainly as a consequence of underlying  disease, with abnormal heart rhythms occurring. Participants in high-dynamic  sports appear to be those who are at the greatest risk. Many of the tests available are not sufficiently sensitive to  identify those with the most serious conditions. To seek to act on limited  results could result in excluding inappropriately huge numbers of healthy  people from participating in sport.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The report by the Department of Health and Children in the Irish Republic  last year concluded that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There is insufficient evidence to support the  implementation of a mass population screening programme to identify risk of  SCD.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members must bear that in mind. The DUP amend&shy;ment seeks to  incorporate all means of preventing needless loss of life in a manner that  ensures expert opinion is taken on board. It extends the possible options beyond screening and allows for other  proposals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is essential that decisions, and the subsequent allocation  of resources, are based on firm evidence. The Dublin-based specialist Dr Gavin  Blake admitted recently that screening tests may not be the solution to the  deaths of young sports stars. The cardiologist expressed concern that tests  were not guaranteed to identify heart problems. He said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I think as cardiologists, our concern is that screen  tests are not perfect. We don&rsquo;t have a single test that can identify children  that are at risk of sudden and unexpected problems when they are playing sport.  It&rsquo;s as simple as that. That&rsquo;s our reluctance in embracing a widespread  screening programme.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Understandably, the relatives of young victims want action,  but it is the duty of Members to ensure that any decisions taken are the right  ones. Where there is conflicting or inconclusive evidence, it is important to  ensure that we have all the information that we require before making a final  judgement. I support the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht  seo agus ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; go mbeidh Sinn F&eacute;in ag tac&uacute; leis an r&uacute;n. I welcome  the debate, and I am pleased that the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety, Michael McGimpsey, is in the  Chamber to listen to it. I support the motion because it is not  absolutely prescriptive, and it refers to bringing forward options for a  comprehensive screening service.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is better not to be  prescriptive about how to proceed. As Iris Robinson and Dominic Bradley  said, we must hear from the experts, including medical experts. Families and  parents of those who have died have also become experts and should be heard in  this debate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, d&eacute;anaim comhbhr&oacute;n &oacute; chro&iacute; leo, my sympathy goes  to all of the families that have lost loved ones as a result of heart defects.  I include those young people who have recently died while actively  participating in sport. Such deaths tend to be high profile and provoke a lot  of public concern and fear. They command public attention and touch every home.  The deaths of Cormac McAnallen, the Tyrone Gaelic football captain, John  McCall, the young rugby star, Patrick Devlin, Patrick Breen and the two young  boys from County Westmeath  in the last month have shocked people the length and breadth of Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those deaths have concentrated people&rsquo;s minds on the  condition.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must listen to the experts, and we must study not only  the report of the Irish Government&rsquo;s task force on sudden cardiac death, but  the recommendations of the American Heart Association&rsquo;s 1996 consensus panel  report, &lsquo;Cardiovascular Preparticipation Screening of Competitive Athletes&rsquo;. That report says that a justifiable and  compelling case for the establishment of a comprehensive screening service for  young athletes can be made on ethical, legal and medical grounds.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish Government&rsquo;s task force points to a particular  group that is a priority for risk assessment. That group comprises the  first-degree relatives of those who have suffered sudden cardiac death under  the age of 40: they may be at increased risk of having an inherited disorder  such as that described.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although there is concern for those who participate in  sports and exercise, perhaps there should be some categorisation of or  differentiation between moderate- and high-intensity sports, with the latter  being the highest priority for risk assessment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Like other Members, I  have not yet heard a convincing case for mass screening. However, there  is a role for risk assessment for those who exercise or participate in sport. A  balance must be struck, however, because participation in sport and exercise are  inherently good and should be  encouraged. All major sporting organisations should undertake &mdash; and many do &mdash;  pre-participation assessment for elite players. Such assessments could be  extended and broadened.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I note, as did Dominic Bradley, the primary assess&shy;ment  phase of the GAA&rsquo;s player welfare scheme. Its questionnaire  asks, for example, whether the participant has a heart condition, whether a doctor has ever advised them  not to participate in sport, or whether they have ever fainted during or after exercise. If a person answers yes to any of the 11 questions, further medical  screening is required, and a GP referral is made.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are probably more defibrillators in County Tyrone  than in any other county. Volunteers are trained to use them, and I commend  everybody who raises aware&shy;ness of, and funds for, that endeavour. Reducing the  incidence of sudden cardiac death is an appropriate objective for a cross-departmental strategy, as the motion  states. Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: In considering the motion and the amendment, it seems that there  are two sides to the matter. On the one hand, there is strong sympathy and  sentiment for the bereaved, but on the other, there are questions about the implementation of the screening that is  being asked for.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that I speak for everyone in the House when I say  that our hearts go out to all those who have lost a loved one, especially  someone young, whether through sport or in some other way.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are two ways to view sympathy. One is to focus on the  tragedy that is effected by the loss of a child, while the other is to focus on  support for those who are suddenly plunged into grief and loss.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I heard a member of a family that had lost a very  young child speak about loss. They said that when someone experiences the shock  of the loss of their child, or another  loved one, they are often incapable of functioning normally in their own  world.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">They went on to say:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;there were a lot  of dark days spent in silent tears and reflection.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All Members, and I am sure I speak for everyone, extend our  sympathy to all those who have lost a loved one, not least the families of  Patrick Devlin and Patrick Breen. On the tide of such emotion, we ask  ourselves: what can we do? Is there  something that should be done? Is there something that the House can do?  Is there something that the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety, and his Department can do?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are many questions that need to be asked. For  example, at what age should a screening programme be commenced &mdash; is it in the  cradle, at school, or later on? What level of screening should be undertaken &mdash;  mere basic screening, or in-depth, intense screening? Do we have enough  resources to undertake a rigorous screening programme, bearing in mind the  compre&shy;hensive spending review and any pressures that it may bring? I am sure  that the Minister will be able to tell us something about that. The cost of a  comprehensive screening programme would be astronomical.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also an ethical issue. If problems occur, are  there enough resources to provide treatment? Is it unethical of a Department to  implement a screening process, and not have the resources to treat those who are  discovered to have an ailment? What would be the knock-on effects in education, in sports, of the possible lack of  physical exercise if a child were discovered to have such an ailment? What  impact would such a discovery have on insurance premiums, on mortgages later in life, and on job situations? I could go  on and on.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the sensible approach is to be guided by the  Chief Medical Officer and his colleagues on the National Screening Committee.  What is the point of the existence of that Committee, if we do not listen to  its expert advice?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment gives us a platform on which we can move  forward sensibly, and not just ride on the tide of the emotion that we have in  sympathy for those who have been so affected. I support the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the proposers of the motion for bringing this important issue before the  Assembly. That said, the Alliance Party will be supporting the amendment, as we  believe it represents a more realistic approach to dealing with this critical  issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously the death of a child &mdash; particularly the sudden  death of a seemingly healthy, active child &mdash; is enormously difficult, and I am  sure that every Member is committed to doing everything that we can to avoid a  repeat of such situations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth noting that, in the case of Patrick Breen in  Drumquin, the best medical practice was followed, with a doctor and  defibrillator on the scene within five minutes, but it was obviously too late  to save the boy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must ensure that, in the natural rush to avoid a repeat  of that tragic occurrence, we do not end up taking steps that may, on  reflection, turn out to be counterproductive. For example, we must be careful  not to give the impression that sport is somehow an unusual or risky activity  for young people to take part in. Indeed, we should be doing the opposite:  trying to encourage people into as much activity as possible. In fact, many  more young people will likely die as a consequence of inactivity than die  because of shocking, but mercifully rare cardiac conditions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Obesity and diabetes are great childhood health problems of  our time, and any steps that can be taken must in no way jeopardise the fight  against those big killers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Fundamentally, we must take steps in line with best medical  practice. Rather than prescribe what the clinical community should do, the  Assembly should first listen to what experts in paediatric cardiology think is  most appropriate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that, in some countries, such as Italy, there is  a system of comprehensive child screening programmes. However, the vast  majority of other developed countries have chosen not to set up such a system.  We need to examine the medical literature on the  experience of Italy  and other countries in preventing sudden cardiac deaths among young  children, instead of rushing to make snap judgements.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the availability of resources is a real issue.  I refer not only to finance, but to Health Service resources in the broadest  sense. However, it should be recognised that money that is spent on one area of  healthcare inevitably means that less money is available to spend on others. We  need to ensure that we spend our money in line with priorities to ensure the  maximum return for the well-being of the population.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The inevitable outcome of any cost-benefit analysis along  National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines will tend towards  saving the life of a child, because a child has a long life ahead of him or  her, and will make a greater contribution to society in the future than an  older person.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As for human resources, paediatric cardiologists are not  exactly thick on the ground in Northern    Ireland. It takes many years to train  doctors and consultants in that highly specialised field. Before imposing a new  burden on the NHS, we need to ensure that it can cope with the demand, and must  train new staff to meet that demand within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Important practical questions should be asked before a  large-scale screening programme for a rare condition is introduced. There is a  danger that the number of minor, non-threatening abnormalities that are detected will vastly exceed the number of  dangerous abnormalities. That raises the spectre of children being  referred for invasive and potentially risky treatment that is entirely  unnecessary, and, in some cases, people will end up labelled, with unwelcome  consequences for their insurance requirements, as Dr Coulter has already  described.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot assess the various risks; that is why we must take  evidence from experts before imposing new burdens on the health sector.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Alliance Party supports the spirit of the  motion and wants to ensure that there will be no tragic repetition of the events  of last month, Members of the Assembly are not best qualified to make  judgements about complex  clinical issues. They should look to qualified medical advice and ensure that  resources are used to achieve the maximum benefit for our young people and for  the population as a whole.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment represents the more realistic way forward,  although I respect the sentiments that lie behind the original motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. Like many others, I am  aware of the increase in the number of young athletes &mdash; and some older  sportsmen &mdash; who die on the sports field. They fall victim to a silent killer  that gives no warning. It is often the case that the first symptom is the  sudden collapse and death of the young person.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This is not a new phenomenon, but sadly it seems to be on  the increase. The loss of a loved one is a tragedy for any family. Grief knows  no boundaries, and our response and concern  should not, in any way, be limited.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sympathetic to many elements of the motion that is  before us, and I will support any action that will be taken by the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety to help reduce the number of such  incidents. However, I believe that the amendment represents the more balanced way  forward. Other Departments will have a part to play. Sport Northern Ireland, under the auspices of the Department of Culture,  Sports and Leisure (DCAL), will work in close co-operation with other  Departments and statutory bodies to share information and research that might  help in some way. Our sports professionals have a significant contribution to  make in this area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we need to recognise the complexities of the  problem and not rush to judgement in determining the most effective way  forward. The problem is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Non-traumatic  sudden death from diseases such as cardiovascular disease are, thankfully, very  rare. Although the intro&shy;duction of a screening process seems a compelling  idea, we must be conscious of the need to develop a correct and affordable  solution.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The low prevalence of those diseases means that we need to  think carefully about what a screening process can achieve. Research indicates  that screening 200,000 competitive athletes will find one whose cardio-vascular disorder may cause death in a specific  situation. Tests can be inaccurate, and differences between normal and  abnormal changes in the heart caused by training and exercise may be difficult  to detect.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The option of alternative technology such as cardio-ultrasound  screening, which may give equally good results, must also be considered. The  opinions of experts are necessary to help us to find the best way forward. The  process that will be developed to protect our young people and athletes must be  well thought through, and must engage a wide range of people to make a  contribution from their area of expertise or responsibility. Regular physical  examinations by medical practitioners should be a vital part of such a  programme.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The incidence of heart disease in families, and general family medical history, must also be  considered. Coaches and parents should have awareness training and be  sensitive to symptoms of chest pain and excessive, unexplained shortness of  breath and be well trained in all aspects related to the physical conditioning  of the young athletes in their care.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The GAA must be commended for its initiative to make  available the best possible assistance in an emergency  through the provision of medical equipment, as well as awareness and  response training in GAA clubs across the Province. The governing bodies of all  sports and associated clubs must take immediate responsibility to provide  efficient training and the appropriate equipment at every sports location.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members must task Departments and Government agencies to  undertake a review of all the possibilities available to us. We need to deliver  urgently a carefully considered and co-ordinated strategy with a range of  options to deal with the problem as effectively as possible. Options must include  school and college services and be characterised by a willing co-operation that  puts young people at the centre of our thinking.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom taca&iacute;ocht a  thabhairt don r&uacute;n. Much of what I had intended to say has been covered by other  Members. Sinn F&eacute;in supports the motion and  is sympathetic to families who are bereaved by losing their children  through sudden death. I am a parent and grandparent, and I imagine that the  sudden death of a child who is apparently the picture of health must be  terribly shocking.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My understanding is that only those below the age of 35  with a family history of sudden cardiac death are entitled to free screening.  Therefore groups such as Cardiac Risk in the Young (CRY) promote screening for  young athletes across the board.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members mentioned the efforts of the GAA,  particularly in County   Tyrone, following the  sudden death of the GAA player Cormac McAnallen. The Tyrone-based campaign to  provide defibrillators and training in most GAA clubs should be commended, as  should the work of the Cormac Trust.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Heartstart UK works with  the British Heart Foundation (BHF) to  provide defibrillators and training at a reduced cost. That initiative  is geared towards schools rather than sporting organisations, which is  something that Members could consider.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members must examine the tenets of the motion that suggest  developing options for a comprehensive screening service. The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety, who is in the Chamber, must take the  options given earlier in the debate to the Department and his team of advisors.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Other factors must also be considered, such as the possible  causes of heart diseases. For example, there is evidence of greater incidence  of heart disease among those living west of the Bann, and that poor health and  poverty are interrelated. We must also be aware that hereditary problems play a  role.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On Friday September 14 2007, &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo; printed a  good, albeit lengthy, letter from a Dr White calling for a well-designed  protocol for those at risk.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly must examine this issue and decide how it can  respond to it. Every Member has mentioned the  need for the promotion of exercise and has expressed concern for the well-being of children who are  involved in sports and play. That must be reinforced at every  opportunity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, the link between obesity and poverty has been  discussed, as well as the need to promote activity, play and sport for better  health. Barry McElduff and Alex Easton referred to the need for robust question&shy;naires  and for greater awareness among sporting bodies and trainers. That must be  encouraged. The argument for strategic location and training in the use of  defibrillators in communities must be taken on board by the Department,  particularly in rural areas where services are out of reach. The efforts of the  Cormac Trust, Heartstart and other mainly voluntary organisations must also be considered by the Department.  Voluntary activity alone is not a response.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to Dominic Bradley for proposing the motion. There needs to be a response at  interdepartmental and Executive level. The Department of Culture, Arts  and Leisure and the Department of Education must also be involved in  discussions. I support the motion. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Support the amendment. I wish to extend my sincerest sympathy to the families  that have recently been bereaved through sudden cardiac death. It is  particularly heart-rending when children are the victims of those conditions. I  am sure that those are the feelings of all Members.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, we have been touched by the heart&shy;breaking  stories that have been in the news about young people who have died from  genetic heart diseases. Indeed, in my constituency, some of us have had  first-hand experience of the death of a teenage girl from such a condition. We  mourned with her family. Although they had been aware of her condition, they  were unable to prevent her death. They worked hard in a successful campaign to  bring a dedicated heart expert to the Province. That happened as a result of a  young girl from Newtownards passing away in her sleep. Her family woke up one  morning to find that she had passed away. She had seemed healthy and had been  involved in sports. There had been no indication that she would die.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At the time of the loss of that young girl in my  constituency, I lent my support not only to the attempt to secure a heart  specialist for the Province, but to Cormac McAnallen&rsquo;s mother Bridget, who said  that all children should be screened for heart problems. This has been an issue  since then.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One in 500 people are believed to have a genetic heart  disease. Although that figure cannot be substantiated, the fact that so many  young people are dying compels us to take it on board. In 2004, the young Irish  rugby player, John McCall, died of heart failure  during a game in South    Africa. At the time, there was  uproar, but here we are, shocked that the same disease has cruelly stuck again.  In Italy, the syndrome has  led to the obligatory screening of all sportsmen and sportswomen, which is the  least that should be done in schools and colleges in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am probably one of the few Leicester City Football Club  supporters in Northern    Ireland. In August 2007, the team played a  match against Nottingham Forest Football Club, which had to be abandoned at  half-time because one of Leicester&rsquo;s defenders  had a heart attack in the dressing room. Interestingly, that player had been  checked just 10 days before the game took place, and was declared fit. I am not  sure how the situation will work out for him.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those conditions give no warnings or signals: they simply  strike. Prevention is always far better than cure. However, there is no cure  for genetic heart conditions that kill before they are detected. If the  Executive and the Health Department were to take the lead in the fight and  start a screening programme for all children, they could save lives. The  amendment is a realistic way to approach  that, and I hope that Members support it. There are two options: people  can go on dying at a rate of eight a week in the United Kingdom owing to a lack  of information and awareness, or the Assembly can take the issue on board and  begin screening all children for heart problems &mdash; or, at the very least, those  who take part in sports &mdash; as part of their general check-ups.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is when members of the family try their hardest to  find information about the condition, and then the rest of the family are  screened. Would it not be better if all young people were screened for  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, rather than families having to face a tragedy  first? Is it not better to help people before it is too late?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Families who have experienced the awful tragedy of one of their young people dying of the condition  thought that no information on the condition was available, particularly  in Northern Ireland.  They found that the only way to find information about the condition was to  search the Internet. Some information found on the Internet may be false while  other information may be accurate. However, there are medical staff who must  answer questions on the condition and give guidance on how to deal with it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the course of my research, I discovered that one boy who  was at risk from sudden death syndrome saw his doctor and, subsequently, was  able to undergo an operation to deal with the condition. Therefore, having the  condition does not necessarily mean that one&rsquo;s life is over; people with the  condition can continue to live. There are  ways of addressing the condition. The amend&shy;ment, perhaps, looks towards  our counterparts in the United    Kingdom. That is where the evidence, and the  information, will be found to deal with the condition.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Currently, people in the Province are learning of the  condition through the media. As with most news, it will become old and  forgotten until tragedy strikes again, and we are shaken to realise that we  have done nothing to address the problem since the last time we we were  shocked. That is why a system is needed in the Province that works with the  people of Northern Ireland to provide care for those suffering from hyper&shy;trophic  cardiomyopathy. Moreover, money must be invested in raising awareness of the  condition and in giving support to those families who have suffered, and are  suffering, because of it. It is the Assembly&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that  that happens. We must act now before we  face another tragedy because of our lack of information on the condition. I support the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: It  is, of course, a tragedy when any young person dies and is robbed of a future.  It is particularly distressing, as other  Members have said, when someone who was considered fit and healthy dies  suddenly, having had no apparent health problems and no history of illness.  There is much media interest in the topic, with some high-profile athletes in Northern Ireland  having died from sudden heart problems. The sad and recent deaths of two young boys are fresh in our minds. It is a very emotive issue, particularly for  those involved.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we need more solid information on sudden death in  children, recognising that, at present, many post mortem examinations are not  carried out by those with expertise in that specific area. The amend&shy;ment  tabled by Mrs Robinson articulates that view.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One related issue, which was raised by many Members during  the debate &mdash; Barry McElduff referred to it &mdash; is the call for more  defibrillators. We must be sensible when considering the issue. I have heard  some Members calling for defibrillators to be installed in every club, school  and public toilet in the country. We cannot forget the practical difficulties  that that would entail. Setting aside the cost, if that equipment were  available in all those places, who would use it? Members have referred to those  who have volunteered to do so, and I pay tribute to them. I know from my own  experience in sports clubs to which I belong, that not too many members would  volunteer to be trained in the use of the equipment, because alongside the training  is the massive burden of responsibility. The individual who is called to use  the equipment may end up in court if the person dies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an onus on the  clubs that have the equipment to use it, even if no one there has been  trained in its use. The club may be vulnerable to legal action and, of course,  there is the danger of equipment being misused by people who are not fully  trained in its use in emergencies. We must be mindful of that when considering  the issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not wish to detract in any way from the seriousness of  the issue. However, we must be careful not to create mass hysteria about young  people playing sport. Dr Farry mentioned that in his speech. There is the  danger that we create a fear among children and particularly among parents, who  will be afraid to allow their children to participate in sport. Sport is a good  thing. Sport can be beneficial to a child&rsquo;s  general health with regard to fitness and to social development. Sport and recreational activity is vital as we fight the  increase in obesity which is prevalent among the young.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is not to say that we should do nothing &mdash; quite the  contrary. We must be realistic and measured in how we respond to the problem of  sudden death syndrome and look at a wide range of options. The Reverend Dr  Coulter made two excellent points &mdash; and not just because I was going to make  them as well. He mentioned the age at which young people should be screened for  the condition. Usually, children under the age of 14 will not be screened  because ECG testing on prepubescent children is inconclusive.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">He also told us that if a heart defect is detected, there  is an onus to take action to remedy it. He also said that such a diagnosis  affects that person&rsquo;s ability to get mortgages,  life insurance and so on. That is an important point that must not be  forgotten.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">6 00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Shannon told us that screening is compulsory in Italy. Indeed, in the University  of Ulster at Jordanstown in my  constituency of East Antrim, an excellent CRY  clinic is run once a week. It is supported nationally by Steve Redgrave and Ian  Botham and, locally, by Gary Longwell and Pat Jennings. I have learnt from my  correspondence with CRY that, over the past year, 2,000 to 3,000 people across the UK have been screened and  that that number is increasing every year. I believe that the intention is to  create more such facilities in Northern Ireland,  particularly in Londonderry. Mobile screening  units that can go to clubs and other venues on request are also available. That  is useful, as CRY provides that service to elite athletes or those who have  been referred by their GPs for some of the symptoms that we heard about at the  start of the debate. However, as we have  heard already, those proposals are not perfect.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we do not create panic among parents  and children who enjoy playing sport, but that we investigate those who are  most at risk and those who are involved in elite sports at a young age.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I, therefore, support the amendment and hope that it will  lead to a fully costed and evidence-based case for helping to reduce avoidable  cardiac deaths among young people.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for calling me. I was not sure whether I would be  called to speak, but I am delighted that I have been because sudden cardiac  death is a very important and topical issue. I am also delighted that the  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is present, and I hope  that he will give us a commitment that something will be done.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I read the motion and  the amendment, and, like other motions and amendments, they confuse me  because they both say more or less the same thing, only worded a little  differently. I will refer to both later.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am a GP in a county that has been hit particularly hard  by sudden cardiac death, although it can happen anywhere and in any county and  is no respecter of age or gender. Last week, one of my partners in practice  told me that parents are already approaching GPs to get their children checked  for defects. Another GP in my area told me a  similar story. The matter is very much in the public&rsquo;s mind, and  something must be done.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, sudden cardiac death has no respect for age. We  know about the death of the two very young Patricks, Patrick Breen and Patrick  Devlin, and of the fit young adults Cormac McAnallen and John McCall, whom  Members have already mentioned. It just shows you. It must be pointed out that  such deaths also affect females. Furthermore, it can happen to people who are  not involved in sport at all &mdash; I was watching much of the debate in my room and  heard a Member mention that. Those points should not be forgotten.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The major problem seems to be cardiomyopathy, although  there are other diseases as well. As a GP, I know about defibrillators, and my  local club in Tyrone has one. Yes, they will help, but let us face it: sudden cardiac death is due to an arrhythmia, which is a  rhythm disturbance brought about by a heart defect. The person using a  defibrillator has three to five minutes to get the heart going again; otherwise  the individual will be dead or brain-dead &mdash; although there is not really much  difference. Defibrillators are certainly helpful, but they are not the complete  answer.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to consider taking action to deal with  this matter. Something must be done, and both the motion and the amendment  agree on that. Jim Shannon said that prevention is better than cure, and that  is true. Certain tests are cheap: electrocardiograms, which are tracings of the  heart, are very cheap to carry out, and  they can perhaps pick up on people at risk. Then we can move on to tests  such as echocardiograms, which are much more expensive.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">After the tragic events  in Tyrone, my son, a fit young man of 19, who is taller than I am, was  alarmed while he was playing a game of  football to see someone on the sideline holding a defibrillator. I share  other Members&rsquo; concerns about that. That is why I am not happy with the word  &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; in the motion, because it suggests that everybody should be  screened. That is where we cause undue  alarm and anxiety, which, believe me, also has consequences for people&rsquo;s  health. We do not want children who  participate in sports to see people carrying defibrillators, because  that will cause alarm.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This is an important matter that has attracted publicity,  because, for the most part, it concerns young lives. A child of 10 or 15 years  of age can expect to live to 70 years of age or longer. I mean no disrespect,  but to resuscitate the heart of people in their 80s may only give them three or  four more years of life.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to pay tribute to Cardiac Risk in the Young, the  Cormac Trust and the University   of Ulster at Jordanstown,  which now provides facilities in which patients can be checked. However,  problems can some&shy;times arise with the procedures, making diagnosis  unobtainable until the patient is older. There are false positive results and  false negative results; these conditions are  not simple, and neither are the treatments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members have mentioned the use of defibrillators and the fact that children might in future avoid  becoming involved in sports. I read Dr White&rsquo;s article in &lsquo;The Irish  News&rsquo; last week, to which Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n referred earlier. If what he says is  true &mdash; I have no reason to doubt him &mdash; 2% of Italian athletes are told at a  young age to avoid becoming involved in sport. My sons would not do that, no  matter which doctor had advised them. A solution must be found, and we must  work on this issue. I ask the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to give a commitment to examine the matter seriously. I support the  amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: It is unfortunate  that this issue has been brought to the Floor of the House as a result of the  tragic deaths of two children. I want to add my condolences to the families of  Patrick Devlin and Patrick Breen during this  terrible time. Every young death is a tragedy, but when that death  occurs in an apparently fit and healthy  young person, the devastation is much greater, because it is unexpected  and comes without any kind of warning.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those deaths have not occurred in isolation. Two young  players from County   Westmeath died earlier  this month. Zeeshan Muhammed died while  playing football in his schoolyard in Athlone, and Tony Parker died just  before he was due to take part in a physical education class in his school in Moate. Members have also recalled the  tragic loss of the young lives of John McCall, who died on a rugby tour in South Africa,  and Cormac McAnallen.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In this day and age, we have come to associate death with  increasing old age, and to have young people struck down before their potential  is fulfilled, without their families having  the time to adjust and say goodbye, is very difficult to deal with. The  fear that another family member might have inherited the same &mdash; possibly fatal  &mdash; condition causes high levels of stress for the grieving family, which is  difficult to imagine.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Heart disease is the most common cause of unexpected sudden  death in all age groups. In people over 40 years of age, heart disease is  usually due to coronary artery disease, which is the narrowing or blockage of  the blood vessels that supply the heart muscle. However, in young people, the  majority of sudden deaths are due to  congenital or inherited disorders of the heart muscle and irregular  heart rhythms. Estimates from studies in other countries suggest that there are  probably about five sudden unexpected cardiac deaths from different causes in  young people in Northern    Ireland every year.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to note that, although most sudden deaths  of young people occur as a result of underlying heart problems, those are not  single conditions, and there are many different causes. More than 20 different  conditions have been identified as causes of sudden cardiac death in young  people. However, a few groups of conditions are responsible for most sudden  deaths, and the largest group are the cardiomyopathies, which are abnormalities  of the heart muscle and are usually inherited. The other major group of  disorders affect the electrical condition in the heart and can trigger abnormal  heart rhythm. Those disorders are believed to occur in one in 5,000 people.  Congenital heart defects are another important group.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the cardiomyopathies &mdash; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy &mdash;  is estimated to affect one in 500 people in the UK. It is the most common cause of  sudden death in young athletes, accounting for up to 40% of such deaths,  according to one study in the US.  The majority of sufferers of hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy have no symptoms  prior to sudden death. A few sufferers may have a family history of a  sudden or unexpected death, and some may  have signs or symptoms of cardiac disease, such as chest pain,  palpitations or blackouts. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a hereditary disease  associated with at least 150 genetic mutations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sadly, there is no cure  for cardiomyopathy. However, several treatments, including medicines,  pacemakers, implantable defibrillators and surgery may have a role in improving symptoms or in preventing  complications. Patients with cardiomyopathy and other heart diseases are usually referred to a consultant cardiologist,  a number of whom have a specialist interest in the subject, and other  inherited cardiac conditions. In those families where the genetic abnormality  has been identified, it may be possible to do genetic tests for that specific  mutation. Specialist services in that field are provided by a consultant  cardiologist and the regional genetic centre in the Belfast Health and Social  Care Trust. In addition to clinical tests and treatment, counselling, advice  and information are provided for children and adults who suffer from inherited  heart disease.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In one major way, Northern   Ireland has contributed significantly to advances in  cardiology because the portable defibrillator was invented by Professor Frank  Pantridge, who was a cardiologist in the Royal Victoria   Hospital. Until recently,  defibrillation required considerable skill  and training, and was largely restricted to medical and nursing staff.  However, the recent introduction of the automated external defibrillator has  meant that the average layperson, following a brief period of training, should  be easily able to perform defibrillation. It is estimated that over 1,000  volunteers are skilled in that area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department is also working with the Northern Ireland  Ambulance Service and other key stakeholders to develop and implement a  first-responder strategy for Northern Ireland. Appropriately trained local volunteers,  using automated defibrillators, together with associated skills, can provide  life-saving first aid, particularly in remote rural areas, until an accident  and emergency ambulance can reach the scene.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that there have been calls for a screening programme, and I have heard those calls today.  However, it must be considered whether the available evidence indicates  that screening is always the right course of action. If it is not, we must  consider what we must do to protect our children from such a devastating  condition. It is a complex issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no specific test or one single solution to  identifying all those at risk of the various causes of sudden cardiac death. In  those who have a regular heart rhythm, the ECG may be normal when the person is  at rest, and the characteristic changes may be present only after the  administration of a specific drug. In others, it may require repeated ECGs and  exercise monitoring before the diagnosis can be made.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Even if there were a successful screening test, it would be  difficult to define at what age to begin screening. There is no optimum age at  which to screen, so some people could die before they were screened and others  after they were screened, if their conditions were not detected. Studies have  shown that there is little evidence that starting treatment before the onset of  symptoms makes a difference to the course of the disease. In fact, the majority  of people with those underlying conditions do not have any symptoms for all or  most of their lives, and will go on to have a normal lifespan. It is only in a  small minority of cases that the condition leads to unexpected death, often in  early adulthood. It is difficult to predict who will die suddenly and who will  have a normal lifespan.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are also concerns about the possible negative aspects  of screening, including enforced changes in lifestyle, consequences for  employment prospects, and securing insurance in the future. There are also  psychological consequences of telling a young adult and his or her family that  they have a condition that might kill them without warning, and for which there  is no effective treatment or preventative measure.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The UK National  Screening Committee (NSC) advises Government and the four UK Health  Departments on all aspects of screening. To inform its proposals and advice,  the NSC draws on the latest research evidence and the skills of a group of  experts. For 10 years, the former Chief Medical Officer in Northern Ireland,  Dr Henrietta Campbell, chaired that group, and a senior medical officer from  the Department currently sits on the NSC.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members of the NSC  assess proposed new population screening programmes against a set of  internationally recognised criteria. They ask questions about the tests, treatment options and the effectiveness and  acceptability of the screening programme. By assessing programmes in  that way, their intention is to do more good than harm to the population.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Since the NSC was established, it has made several  recommendations on screening policy that have been implemented in Northern    Ireland. They include diabetic  retinopathy screening, which I launched recently, and the hearing screening of  all newborn babies. It has also recommended screening for bowel cancer.  Providing the Department&rsquo;s bid under the comprehensive spending review is  successful, I hope to introduce that in 2009, and it is expected to save 70  lives a year.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The NSC has previously considered the research evidence on screening for hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy and has advised that the current evidence does not  support the introduction of a screening programme. That advice is due for  imminent review in 2007-08. I have asked a departmental official to accelerate  the process as far as is possible, and the Chief Medical Officer has already  raised the issue with the chair of the NSC.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been some research on, and much discussion about, the risk assessment for those  involved in sport and exercise. The evidence for screening is not  strong, and there are varying practices in different countries. In Italy,  pre-participation screening programmes using an ECG exist for competitive  athletes who compete at national and international level. In 1998, American  research estimated that 200,000 competitive athletes would need to be screened  potentially to identify one athlete who would die as a result of taking part in  competition.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I must stress, however, the importance of raising awareness  of the complex condition. The careful provision of information can do much to  educate the public. I emphasise wholeheartedly that if young people are  experiencing concerning symptoms, such as unusual breathlessness, palpitations,  dizziness or fainting, it is important that they seek advice from their GP.  However, the Department does not want to cause undue anxiety or panic among  parents and families by suggesting that the problem is more common than it  really is.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The vital contribution that voluntary organisations have  made in bringing the issue to the fore must be recognised. As has been  mentioned, a heart charity, Cardiac Risk in the Young has established a clinic  in the University   of Ulster at Jordanstown.  CRY provided the equipment, but the university provides the facilities and the  staff. I add my warm tribute to the dedicated work of the Cormac Trust, CRY and  other voluntary organisations that have done so much to raise awareness of this  issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland, a service framework for cardiovascular health and well-being is being  developed. I have asked that sudden cardiac death is addressed in that  framework, which is due to be published in April 2008. It is vital that any  service that affects the lives of young people is based on sound evidence. It  is worth taking time to get the service right, and it is essential to examine  best practice elsewhere.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have also asked the Chief Medical Officer to lead a  workshop for health experts in cardiology, clinical psychology, genetics and  research academics in the field, officials from the relevant Departments,  public health bodies, the Sports Council for Northern Ireland and voluntary  organisations. The workshop&rsquo;s remit is to explore thoroughly what further steps  are available and to inform future policy development in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The correct policy must be found: in doing so the Assembly  will pay a proper tribute to those children who lost their lives at such a  young age and in such a terrible way.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for being in the House for the debate. There have been  more debates in the Chamber about health than about any other subject. In  supporting the amendment, I extend my sympathy to all families who have lost  young people on or off the sports field. However, it would be remiss of me not  to single out the Breen family who are present today. They are relatively close  neighbours and are natives of my own village   of Drumquin in west  Tyrone. When the community there heard that such a young lad had died on the  sports field, it not only brought a sense of disbelief to the locality and  devastation to the family, it raised the question in everyone&rsquo;s thoughts &mdash;  could anything have been done to prevent the tragedy?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have no doubt that all families that have found  themselves in that position have pondered the same question. However, there is  no clear medical evidence as to the root cause of sudden cardiac death amongst  athletes. A study carried out in the USA on the causes of sudden cardiac death in high-school students, college  athletes and military recruits found that a wide variety of conditions were responsible, and the study was  unable to establish a common underlying cause for those sport-related  deaths. That has resulted in different conclusions being drawn and has led to  the develop&shy;ment of varying practices in different countries.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have tabled the amendment to widen the scope for the  Minister and the Executive to consult with their UK counterparts through the UK  National Screening Committee (NSC), and to bring forward a fully-costed,  evidence-based proposal to help reduce such avoidable cardiac deaths, which  includes the introduction of screening  programmes where appropriate. It is important that an evidence-based  strategy is put in place to tackle this all-important issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A report by the Task  Force on Sudden Cardiac Death revealed that there is insufficient  evidence to support the implementation of a mass population screening  programme, but there is, however, a role for risk assessment in respect of  those involved in exercise or sport. Given that heart conditions are often  hereditary, it is vital that families with a history of this condition are  identified and assessed at an early stage and sent for screening if necessary.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also important that the sudden deaths of sport  participants do not discourage our young people from taking part in sport. It  is widely accepted that regular exercise reduces the risk of developing or  dying from cardiac heart disease, obesity and other associated conditions. Even  in childhood, there is substantial evidence to prove that regular physical  activity positively affects body composition, reduces the risk of cardiac heart  disease and provides immediate health benefits. A balanced approach must be  taken, through the publicity and provision of information on the health benefits  of regular exercise.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On listening to the debate, I sense that there is unity in  the House regarding the way forward. Several Members mentioned the opinions of  experts, and there is consensus that the Assembly must listen to experts and  move forward on their advice. Indeed, the Chair&shy;person of the Committee for  Health, Social Services and Public Safety referred to current resources, the  need to use them wisely and the need to provide an evidence-based way forward  that incorporates all means of preventing avoidable deaths. Reference was also  made to cross-departmental strategies that must be taken on board.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Shannon mentioned having a system that works, which is obviously needed, and Alastair Ross  mentioned the importance of sport.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All those factors will  form part of the way forward. I appeal to all Members to support the  amendment, as it is the way to proceed on the issue.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  The motion has provided the House with the opportunity to have a sensitive  debate on sudden cardiac death. The death of a young, healthy person is very distressing, and we have every  sympathy for the parents and families of those who have suffered such a  loss.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Understandably, such a scenario throws up many questions,  particularly about why the death occurred and how it could have been avoided.  Members have highlighted the many concerns of families, worried parents and  sports&rsquo; bodies. There is considerable agreement on appropriate screening,  especially for those who are most at risk. Many Members have talked about  having a range of screening, including risk assessment, with the health warning  that it is not perfect, given the possibility of false negatives and positives.  However, screening can certainly be a way forward, particularly for those who  are at high risk.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly must, of course, listen to cardiologists, who  are the experts in the field, while continuing to encourage participation in  sport. Information, guidance and screening are needed, which is what the public  are calling for. The SDLP motion asked for  a range of options, including a comprehensive screening service.  &ldquo;Comprehensive&rdquo; is used in the broadest sense of the word in order to create,  and to allow the exploration of, the widest range of options.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Iris Robinson, who proposed the amendment, spoke of the  sudden death of many young gymnasts. She mentioned the fact that those people  are healthy and that they expect support when it is needed. She also said that  resources need to be directed carefully and that an evidence-based service is  needed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Barry McElduff rightly said that the motion is not  prescriptive, that we need to hear from the experts &mdash; the cardiologists &mdash; and  that we must learn from other bodies, such as the American Heart Association  and the Irish Government&rsquo;s task force on the issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Rev Coulter mentioned the importance of having  sympathy, sentiment and support for those who grieve. He also mentioned the  many questions that the issue raises on ethics, legal implications and  insurance. All those are important points to consider.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Stephen Farry spoke of the importance of physical activity,  on which, like so many aspects of this issue, all  Members agree. He also said that we should continue to promote exercise  and the best medical practice.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Easton said that  there was a compelling argument for screening. However, he said that it  needs to be costed and must be part of a co-ordinated strategy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n emphasised the need for screening in  schools, which the motion also requested. Jim Shannon talked about genetic  heart disease, the need for specialist facilities and to raise awareness, and  the search for answers. He called for the immediate introduction of obligatory  screening.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Alastair Ross talked  about the costing of defibrillators, his own experience in sports&rsquo; clubs  and the burden of the training in and use of such equipment. He praised the  work of organisations such as Cardiac Risk in the Young, and he mentioned the  good work that mobile units carry out.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Kieran Deeny said that something must be done and that his  patients are asking many questions. Although he raised his concern about the  use of defibrillators, the motion is not about that &mdash; it is exclusively about screening. Many sports&rsquo; clubs already have  defibrillators, and getting them involved a great deal of community and  charity work.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Minister &mdash; who, as usual, is welcome and is  always present at health-related debates &mdash; gave an informative and helpful explanation of the conditions required  for screening, its pros and cons, and statistics relating to it. He said that a  review is imminent, and that is welcome and timely. He also mentioned the  service framework, and said that it will include sudden cardiac death. He  further said that the Chief Medical Officer will lead a workshop with  cardiologists.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Tom Buchanan expressed his sympathy and said that there is  insufficient evidence to support screening, but he mentioned the role of risk  assessments, the need to listen to experts, and the sense of unity in the House  regarding the way forward.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic and I carefully considered the wording of the  motion. We are asking the Minister to bring forward a range of options. As I  have already said, that should be a comprehensive range of options and a  comprehensive screening service. What we are looking for is the widest range of  options. Many Members who supported the amendment quoted from the motion, so I  do not believe that there is any difference between the spirit of the motion  and that of the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When we call for a wide range of options, we are looking  for the simplest screening procedure for those in high-risk categories to be  brought into schools. When we say &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo;, we do not mean &ldquo;universal&rdquo;.  We want the full range of options to be looked at, and the Minister has said  that it will be. That is very important.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said, I do not believe that there is much  difference between the spirit of the motion and that of the amendment, and the  SDLP wants to avoid unnecessary tension,  because this is a sensitive issue. To that end, we will not oppose the  amendment, because we all want to find the best way forward for these  unfortunate young people and their grieving families.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">Question, </span>That the amendment be  made, <span class="Italic">put and agreed to.</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. May I ask you to investigate a  situation that arose in the House earlier today? This morning, I was three  minutes late for a ministerial statement and was, therefore, denied the right to  speak. I accept that as the rule of the House. However, later in the afternoon,  a Member who was not present for the debate was allowed to make a winding-up  speech.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to raise his point of order after we have  finished with the motion. We are in the middle of the process. It is certainly  a matter that can be raised with the Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses its sympathy to the families of  Patrick Breen and Patrick Devlin, who died recently on the sports field from  heart defects; sympathises with all families who have lost loved ones in this  way; and calls upon the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety,  and the Executive, to consult with their United Kingdom counterparts through  the National Screening Committee, and bring forward fully costed,  evidence-based proposals to reduce avoidable cardiac deaths in the young,  including screening programmes where appropriate.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I apologise for interrupting the  business at an inappropriate time.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This morning, I was, rightly, denied speaking rights  because I was three minutes late for a ministerial statement. However, this  afternoon, several Members were not present for most of the debate, but were  permitted to contribute to it. One in particular was allowed to make a  winding-up speech. Other Members participating in the debate this evening have  openly told you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that they had not been present for most of  it and had been listening to it elsewhere. Will you investigate this matter and  provide a ruling?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I am happy to refer that to the Speaker and to get a reply to you,  Mr Bradley.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion made:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Assembly do now adjourn. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Mr  Deputy Speaker]</span></p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="7"></a>Adjournment</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Maximising Tourism Potential in the Strangford  Constituency</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>: It is widely accepted and acknowledged on all sides of the  House that our economy is in urgent need of transformation. The structural  weaknesses in our economy have been well rehearsed in the Chamber in the past  and need no elaboration today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Regardless of the doubts of some Members, I think we must  encourage every aspect of the private sector to expand and take its rightful  place in the driving seat of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s economy. One obvious area in which  the private sector can fulfil that responsibility is tourism.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">By any barometer, tourism is a growth area in Northern Ireland,  and in the Strangford constituency. The latest available base-year figures show  that total tourism income represents 3&middot;5% of the gross value added (GVA) in  Northern Ireland, is worth &pound;783 million to the economy and employs 28,700  full-time equivalent jobs. ASM Howarth recently published a survey in 2006 on  the Northern Ireland  hotel industry, which showed that local hotels enjoyed an occupancy rate of  close to 70%. That was a record high and represented an increase of 3% on the  previous year.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In my own patch, tourism is a critical component of the  local economy. The Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB) estimated that in 2005 tourists spent &pound;16 million in the  Ards Borough Council area, which -takes up the largest part of Strangford. An  economic impact study is being carried out by the Armagh  and Down Regional Tourism Partnership and includes the entire Strangford constituency. I understand that the early  findings indicate that many hundreds of millions are being spent in the  economy through tourism, when day trippers and those staying with relatives are  included in the figures.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, despite the important position tourism already has  in our economy, we are not maximising our full potential, and that is widely  accepted. The NITB stated that if Northern   Ireland had matched the Republic of Ireland&rsquo;s  external visitor trends since 1969, tourism would be worth an extra &pound;270  million in income, and would generate an additional 11,000 jobs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is worthwhile  remembering why tourism in Northern Ireland represents only 2% of our gross domestic product  (GDP) compared to 9% in the Republic and 11% in Wales. It is not because we have  suddenly discovered the whole concept of tourism, or that people suddenly want  to come here, it is because for more than 35 years this place was subjected to  civil strife. When innocent civilians were the victims of random terrorist  violence, it is no wonder that outsiders stayed away.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Hopefully, those days are long gone, and their demise will  present Northern Ireland  with an excellent opportunity to capitalise on political stability and bring a  fresh focus from abroad, which will perhaps attract new tourists. We have all  been encouraged by the reaction to the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, with record numbers visiting the event and  experiencing something of Northern    Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the subject of the debate might suggest otherwise,  I am not parochial about the issue. We must maximise  the tourism potential of the whole of Northern Ireland in the hope that a rising tide will lift all boats.  I want to see the tourism sector across Northern   Ireland overcome fundamental problems such as the lack of  suitable skills, and acknowledge issues such as the lack of a distinct Northern Ireland brand, and the associated fall  off in visitor numbers from Great    Britain, whilst those from the rest of the  world are on the rise.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We also need to anticipate other problems such as the need  for a national conference centre to compete with the one in the pipeline for Dublin. To achieve those  aims we must make the most of all our tourist attractions in each and every  part of our Province. In short, places such as Strangford should receive their  fair share of support so that they can contribute to the growth of tourism  overall.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad when there are adjournment debates on the  Strangford constituency, because looking at the Members in the House at the  moment shows the DUP domination there, and that is always good to see.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that Members, particularly those from Strangford,  will forgive me for indulging briefly in a little promotion of the area that I  consider myself lucky to live in and represent. We all believe that our  constituencies are the most beautiful, but in the case of Strangford it is very  much true. The sheer volume and diversity of our tourism attractions is  probably unparalleled in Northern    Ireland. At the heart of our offering to  tourists is Strangford Lough, which was voted the fourth best view in the United Kingdom  in a show seen by millions across the country. The fact that people in Northern  Ireland were unable to vote, because of the screening of a rugby match, is  testament to how good the view is, given that it came in at fourth place  despite those problems. Strangford&rsquo;s shores are surrounded by excellent places  of interest for every type of tourist &mdash; Mount  Stewart, Scrabo Tower,  Nendrum, Delamont, the Somme Heritage Centre, Exploris, and the Wildfowl and  Wetlands Centre at Castle Espie, which already draw hundreds of thousands of  tourists from all over the world year in, year out. I hope I have not offended  anyone by leaving something out of the list.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Strangford is home to a great many events and festivals,  with sports and outdoor activities such as golf, fishing and sailing, which can  be enjoyed in some of the best surroundings in Northern Ireland, and our  hospitality is second to none. Our proximity to Belfast, so often a hindrance in other  aspects of economic development, is a positive advantage in the realm of  tourism. The product is there; is it simply a matter of exploiting it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will outline a few specific areas where there is scope  for significant improvement in Strangford&rsquo;s tourism potential. No discussion of  tourism can be allowed to pass without dwelling on the lough from which our  constituency takes it name. The biggest inlet in the British Isles is home to an  exceptional variety of more than 2,000 marine species, the largest breeding  population of common seals in Ireland  and many migrating birds from all over the world. Indeed, its rich, diverse,  abundant, and sometimes unique, bird, marine and animal population is  recognised in its status as Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s first marine nature reserve, and  sets us apart not only in a British or European context but also in a global  perspective. It may not be a world heritage site, but it is world-renowned.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a widely held view that Strangford Lough has been  under-marketed compared to other attractions in Northern   Ireland, such as the Giant&rsquo;s   Causeway and the Fermanagh lakes. If we are to maximise Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  undoubted tourism potential, it could be argued that such a target will ever be  achieved only by highlighting and developing new jewels in the crown, instead  of concentrating solely on the well-established ones. I do not mean that in  purely monetary terms: Strangford must be accepted as an asset.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have long felt that the best way to show such an  acceptance and to capitalise on Strangford Lough&rsquo;s potential would be to  establish it as one of the Tourist Board&rsquo;s signature projects. Strangford Lough  was omitted from the first slate of signature projects, and although we have no  argument against those projects that were included, surely Strangford Lough,  with its many unique designations and broad tourism offerings around it shores,  could be considered, after 2009, as a new  signature project. In the past, I have even suggested that Strangford  Lough could be included in a wider loughs signature project, which could  include Fermanagh&rsquo;s lakes or Lough Neagh. Strangford Lough should be in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  portfolio of top-class tourism attractions &mdash; however it is done &mdash; and I hope  that the Tourist Board will consider the case of Strangford Lough for future  signature project status.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Strangford Lough could also provide Northern Ireland with  an excellent opportunity to take advantage of the increasing interest in ecotourism  &mdash; and by that I do not mean three Irish guys running around the Colombian  jungle &mdash; I mean the form of tourism that is already worth an estimated $3&middot;6  trillion in economic activity globally.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have already spoken of the many environmental  designations that Strangford Lough enjoys, yet more could be achieved. Ards  Borough Council, of which I am a member, has taken a lead in its limited way  through Exploris &mdash; the Northern Ireland Aquarium &mdash; and an annual ecotourism  conference. However, the council is operating in a policy vacuum with little or  no leadership at a higher level. With the anticipated growth in this sector,  and the fact that ecotourists usually spend more than other tourists,  Strangford Lough is ripe for a flagship ecotourism project such as the Ards and Down Salmonid Enhancement Association  (ADSEA) scheme, which some of my party colleagues are interested in.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">6.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have already mentioned  the Northern Ireland Tourist Board&rsquo;s signature projects, and just as  important as securing such a status for Strangford Lough is the continued  assurance that the Strangford constituency is tied in with existing, more  generic, projects. The Strangford constituency is already intimately involved  in the St Patrick&rsquo;s/Christian Heritage tourism signature project, but perhaps  the greatest potential in Strangford lies in what we all suspect may be the  signature project with the greatest potential of all &mdash; the Titanic project. My  hometown of Comber has a huge connection with Titanic, as it is the hometown of  the ship&rsquo;s designer, Thomas Andrews. The local council is engaged in developing  a walking tour around the town, taking in many Titanic-related sites. Comber  may be only a tiny part of the Titanic tale, but it is a part nonetheless, and  it is important that the development of the Titanic signature project include  Comber and its deeper insight into the story of that ship.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Strangford is a hotbed of Ulster-Scots culture and  heritage. In fact, since it is the home of the Ulster-Scots Academy,  we almost consider ourselves as the Ulster-Scots capital. The reawakening of  the Ulster-Scots tradition is worthy in its own right, but it also presents us  with tremendous tourism opportunities. For far too long the impression of Northern Ireland given to the outside world has  been one dominated by everything from Irish dancing and Irish music to  leprechauns and shillelaghs &mdash; everything but what is distinctive and different  about Northern Ireland.  It is little wonder that that problem perpetuates, given that the marketing of Northern Ireland to the world &mdash; including the  rest of the United Kingdom &mdash;  is in the hands of Tourism Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge that they have done a great job in selling  the whole of Ireland to the  world, and visitor numbers from places such as North America and the Far East are on the rise. However, numbers of visitors  from Great Britain  are falling and have been heading downwards for the past two years. We insult  the intelligence of our fellow countrymen in the rest of the UK by not marketing Northern Ireland as it is. People  in Scotland and Wales know the difference between the Republic of Ireland  and Northern Ireland; they  know the difference Belfast and Dublin, and do not need to be sold some type  of concocted nonsense.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with Tom  McGrath, Chairman of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, who told the  Northern Ireland Affairs Committee that the Northern   Ireland tourism product is diluted when marketed as part  of the island of Ireland:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;because it does not stand out&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster-Scots heritage and culture could be utilised to  increase visitor numbers from Scotland  and, indeed, North America, as the Smithsonian  Folklife Festival has shown. Developing the potential of Ulster-Scots is  essential in order to develop Northern    Ireland tourism and, because of its rich  vein of Ulster-Scots tradition, the Strangford constituency would surely  benefit from such an initiative.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">An accepted weakness of the tourism product in Strangford  is in hotels and conference facilities. Despite its obvious attractions and  great potential, Strangford is not blessed with as many hotels as it should be.  In common with other parts of Northern    Ireland, Strangford suffers from a  restriction in Invest NI&rsquo;s &lsquo;Support for Tourism Businesses 2004-2007&rsquo; policy,  which states that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In the Belfast area,  (defined for this purpose as a radius of 10 miles from Belfast City  Centre) no applications for financial assistance for new hotel developments,  including extensions and upgrades etc to existing properties will be accepted  by Invest NI.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I understand the sense behind such a restriction,  and of ceasing financial support for hotel developments in Belfast that are  likely to be a success, regardless of  support from the public purse, the 10-mile radius rule denies new or  existing hotel developments from availing of initial capital support in key  towns such as Newtownards, which is a  gateway to Strangford. I urge the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to examine  that policy, with a view to assisting hotel developments in Strangford and  elsewhere.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also wish to make a case for not only securing current  levels of funding, but consideration of future growth in resources for the Armagh and Down Tourism Partnership. The regional tourism  partnerships (RTPs), including the Armagh and Down Tourism Partnership, were  created in 2006 and identified in, &lsquo;A Strategic Framework for Action  2004-2007&rsquo;, as the way forward for the delivery of regional priorities. That  important task requires appropriate levels of funding. The RTPs have lost  various elements of EU funding and are now increasingly dependent on their  share of &pound;500,000 worth of core support from NITB, in addition to what they can  elicit from the private sector.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have already outlined the impact of the Armagh  and Down Tourism Partnership in my area. Its input into communications,  marketing, product development and visitor servicing is valuable, and it does a  good job. I agree with the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, which concluded  that RTPs should be properly funded to enable them to carry out their functions  of identifying and pursuing local regional tourism priorities</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are wider issues &mdash; many that are not unique to  Strangford &mdash; that require attention. Those issues are not specifically within  the remit of DETI; however, Members have been encouraged by the Minister&rsquo;s  comments about co-ordinating economic development in general. Tourism fits into that category, particularly in general  areas such as skills development, infrastructure and planning, and, specifically,  the ADSEA project, which I mentioned earlier, and possible National Parks  status at a later date for Strangford.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Strangford is as good a snapshot as any of what is needed to maximise the potential of tourism in Northern    Ireland. Strangford, in common with the rest of the country, has a tourism  product to be proud of. It requires not only assistance, but  encouragement, so that the Strangford constituency, with its wealth of tourism riches, can play its part in building the better,  prosperous, Northern Ireland  that all Members hope for.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I am grateful to Simon for not only securing the debate, but for the commercial  for our constituency. I am glad to speak in advance of Jim Shannon, otherwise,  I imagine, there would be nothing left to say. However, having heard Simon for  the past 20 minutes, I am not sure there is anything to say anyway.  Nevertheless, I will have a bash at it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted to see the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, following a  hard day at the office in front of the Committee, which I listened in to for a  while in the Senate Chamber.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish we had a Giant&rsquo;s Causeway to invest in and a visitor  attraction such as that to argue over, as people are doing in another part of Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Strangford is politically unique, because it has no  republican or nationalist representation in this House. Sometimes I wonder  whether it suffers because of that. I cannot put my finger on the reason, but &mdash;  and sometimes people say this to me &mdash; because it is a predominantly unionist constituency the word &ldquo;tourism&rdquo; does not  seem to fit. I hope that that is not the case, and it would be grossly unfair  if it were. Perhaps the Minister will consider investigating the matter.  Community relations in Strangford are first class, and its MLAs represent the  whole constituency and all its constituents.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly, in conjunction with its partners in the  tourism industry, can help Northern    Ireland emerge as an internationally  competitive tourist destination. I have sourced an article about the ASM  Horwarth hotel industry survey in &lsquo;Business First&rsquo;, volume 3, issue 4. I hope  that nobody else has sourced this and that I am not accused of anything. The  performance of Northern    Ireland hotels in 2006 showed that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The average bedroom occupancy rate was 68.7 per cent&hellip;  an increase of three percentage points when compared with 2005.</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">The average letting rate of a bedroom in 2006 was  &pound;63.20, an increase of 11 percent over 2005.</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Food and beverage sales increased by 13 per cent over  2005.</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Total sales increased by an average of 15.8 per cent  compared to 2005.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">A key point is that Northern   Ireland hotel profitability is now &ldquo;on a par with Dublin&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That should be more than encouraging for potential  investors. I am extremely confident about the future of tourism in our country.  However, against the backdrop of growth, we must ensure that there is an effort  to maximise the tourist potential in the Strangford constituency.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The tourism potential will only be realised through  investment in marketing, product development and physical tourism facilities,  such as infrastructure and accommodation. We need quality facilities and accommodation that will contribute to the  sustainability of an industry when we are asking for growth.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We need hotels to complement the excellent  bed-and-breakfast facilities, which are of the highest standard. Sometimes, I  think that they are almost too good and that the short distance from Belfast to many of our  towns and villages may be discouraging hotel development. Therefore, we must  commend, as Simon Hamilton said, an in-depth look at promoting more hotels in  our area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Strangford should not be seen in isolation. I mentioned the  proximity of Belfast, but perhaps we should  consider Strangford as the hub of, or gateway to, the whole of the region,  extending to the Republic and &mdash; with a natural Ulster-Scots tradition &mdash; to Scotland in  particular.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mention has been made of the Strangford Lough environment,  which is of international and national importance for its bird and marine life.  Although that should be protected, it is important to avoid the perception that  conservation interests are inhibiting the economic development of the area.  That is a key area for the potential development of at least one hotel without  disruption to conservation interests.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past it has seemed to those of us in Strangford that  the tide was out as far as tourism potential in and around Strangford Lough was  concerned.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are still many challenges. However, this debate will  encourage the Assembly, the district councils, the Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, and other partners in the tourism industry, to ensure  that the tide is coming in for us.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are small  villages in pockets around Strangford. Promotion and marketing of  tourism in that area is primarily the responsibility of Ards Borough Council,  Down District Council, and a small element in Castlereagh Borough Council. Ards  Borough Council and Down District Council both operate a range of tourist  facilities, including picnic, caravan and amenity sites. In fact, there is  tremendous potential for the development of caravan sites.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Along with the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development&rsquo;s Forest Service, and the Department of the Environment, through  the Environment and Heritage Service, there is a togetherness in managing  historic and special wildlife sites. Some of those have been mentioned, but  there are also the archaeological remains of the Nendrum monastery near  Whiterock.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The National Trust owns and manages properties of nature  and historical interest. Outside Northern Ireland,  Mount Stewart always gets high ratings as a  place to visit, and there is Rowallane House and Gardens in the Saintfield  area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want the councils to do  more for tourism, as opposed to visitor numbers. There needs to be a  differentiation between real tourists and visitors. Many people visit  Strangford &mdash; they perhaps only come from Lisburn, east Belfast or wherever &mdash; and they are more than  welcome; however, it is real tourists who will help and contribute to our  economy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The village   of Comber is growing into  a town, and is famed for its wide variety of antique and interior shops. It is  a good place to eat now; I am glad that a new coffee-shop culture has developed  there. It is, as was mentioned, the birthplace of Thomas Andrews, the man who  designed the Titanic. It seems strange that Comber has not really claimed him  as a famous son. I understand why the  Titanic Quarter is being built where it is, but perhaps, one day,  someone will provide a bus to take people from the Titanic Quarter to Comber.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Portaferry &mdash; no doubt Kieran will say something about this  &mdash; is a beautiful town at the tip of the Ards Peninsula.  It is an area popular with locals, and it attracts foreign tourists because of  its outstanding beauty and other visitor  attractions, such as the aquarium that Simon Hamilton mentioned.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Newtownards is a main town with a main shopping centre. It  is in an area of astonishing beauty and diversity, which has evolved through  the natural forces of the environment of wind, of water and ice, as well as  through the activity of humans. It is worrying to see subsidence on some of the  coastline there.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  No one is interested.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  They should be.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Portaferry has a successful hotel &mdash; The Narrows. There is  no doubt that it shocked and annoyed everyone &mdash; not only the relatively new  owners, but people all around &mdash; that it was subject to wanton vandalism. Louts  simply came along and smashed windows. I am sure that all Members present have  issued some kind of public statement on that. It is very discouraging for any  hotel owners, or for anyone who owns a business, to be subjected to that, and &mdash;  worse still &mdash; not really to know what is behind it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">While the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment is  present, I want to raise the matter of the general malaise of anti-social  behaviour. I wonder what consideration he would give, from a tourist  perspective, to the detrimental impact that anti-social behaviour undoubtedly  has on tourism.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister consider discussing with the Chief  Constable the impact of antisocial behaviour on the tourist industry? I mean  that sincerely. All Members who represent Strangford have talked with the local  police commander about that problem &mdash; some of us as recently as last week. When  tourists see antisocial behaviour on such a scale as I have seen in Strangford,  it switches them off.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Antisocial behaviour has a serious detrimental effect on  tourism and &mdash; not only that &mdash; it can lead to a bad story being carried back.  Such damage cannot be undone. There is a connection between those two aspects;  and tourism will benefit immensely if we can outlaw antisocial behaviour from  our streets. That would, of course, benefit us all; but antisocial activity has  a particularly dire effect on tourism. Nothing sends people packing from a town  or from an amenity more effectively than a display of vandalism or thuggery.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister also consider the importance of  tourist-driven, as opposed to visitor-driven, support for events? I will not  identify particular events, but it would be useful for a signal to be sent out  that the Department might support events  with a local Strangford flavour. Events of a high-standard could, if  given the attention and the necessary support, become winning tourist  attractions in a short time.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A lot goes on in the constituency, much of it indigenous  and small; but there is a nucleus of events that might bring forward an  entrepreneurial spirit or a new capital risk venture scheme. I hope that people  might be prepared to host events in the Strangford constituency, which could be  identified with and would capture the flavour of the place.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">7.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I would welcome a signal from the Minister that such events  would be supported. I know that his response will be that if he is given the  right event, he will consider it. However, I want to be able to report back to  some people who might seriously consider putting on such events in the  constituency.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I was nearly falling asleep.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will be as quick as I can, because there are other things  to be done. I do not disagree with anything I have heard so far. One or two  things have been missed out, but I will not repeat what any Member has said.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the motion is most supportive of increased  tourism, but I question his attitude to the disposal  of coastal land within the Ards Borough Council area. If Mr Hamilton  wishes to encourage tourists and see our tourist industry thrive, he must know  that we have to provide facilities such as basic car parks and local play areas  along Strangford Lough and the Irish Sea  coast. Mr Hamilton and other DUP members of Ards Borough Council voted to  dispose of such areas and sell the land that visitors and tourists want to come  to, park their cars and enjoy what is there.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, Mr Hamilton and others agreed to the disposal of  a coastal car park outside Ballywalter for the construction of a waste-water  treatment works, which would be a monstrosity on our coastline. Mr Hamilton  must get his priorities right. If he wants to bring more tourists to the  constituency he must reassess his attitude to the disposal of coastal land.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a tremendous opportunity throughout Northern Ireland  to capitalise on the natural assets &mdash; a beautiful landscape and a wonderful  heritage. There is particular evidence of those attributes in the Strangford  constituency, and great potential for a successful and sustainable tourist  industry.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As was pointed out earlier, Strangford Lough is the  centrepiece of the constituency and is recognised throughout the world as an  area of outstanding natural beauty. That designation alone is sufficient to  attract visitors from across the globe. To ensure that the best possible  tourism potential is derived from Strangford Lough, it is essential that the  lough and its coastline are respected, protected and enhanced.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Strangford Lough offers much to encourage visitors, not least a wide variety of active bird life. I am  fortunate enough to live by the edge of the lough, and I can assure  Members that the many species of birds provide wonderful sights and sounds for those who visit. Surely more  effort could be made to encourage birdwatchers to spend some time in Northern Ireland  and along the Strangford Lough coast?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted to see  that the Minister with responsi&shy;bility for tourism, Mr Dodds, is in the  Chamber this evening. I will draw his attention to the fact that in Portaferry,  at the tip of Strangford Lough, we have a wonderful tourist attraction in  Exploris. Since its inception a number of years ago, it has been run and  managed by Ards Borough Council, of which I and other Members present in the  Chamber are members.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I would like the Minister to consider ways in which his Department could contribute, financially or  otherwise, to the future expansion and sustainability of this  magnificent tourist destination. Exploris, which is a replica of what goes on  underneath the surface of Strangford Lough, is almost as important to Northern Ireland as the Giant&rsquo;s   Causeway. People may disagree, but that is my opinion. I ask the  Minister to consider the input that his Department could have to the Exploris  experiment. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment will become more  involved.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Strangford constituency we have many more tourist  attractions that could blossom if sufficient effort was directed towards them  by the Department. For example, there is a rich Christian heritage in the  constituency, and many relics of the past, such as Nendrum, Castlehill,  Greyabbey, Movilla and many more, all of which could make a significant  contribution to tourism if brought together.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of historical events took place in the  constituency. In particular, if Members know their history they may be aware of  the activities of the Presbyterian United Irishmen around 1798. The story  features Betsy Gray at the Six Road Ends, and the part played by the town hall in Newtownards. Mrs Robinson is looking startled &mdash; she may not know what that  entails.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Not only do I know the history, but I  have spoken about it two or three times.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I apologise for my mistake &mdash; the Member certainly looked startled. At least she  knows about the town hall&rsquo;s history.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Saintfield, Ballynahinch, etc, should be of great interest  to visitors and tourists. Indeed, if they were put together on some type of  heritage trail, it would be an excellent attraction not only for our  constituency, but for North Down, South Down and right across the area. There  are many more features that could encourage tourists into our constituency,  such as sport, agriculture, walking, cycling and horse riding; all of which  must be examined and exploited to further the tourism industry.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I must mention Scrabo  Tower and its beautiful parkland, and Mount Stewart,  with its wonderful house and gardens. Ballyquintin Farm, which is right at the  tip of the Ards Peninsula, has tourism potential that  must be explored and exploited. I ask the Minister, his Department, local  councils and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board to work together to produce a  plan to encourage more visitors to visit our shores and, in particular, the  Strangford constituency.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Kieran mentioned Strangford Lough. If he wants more coastal space, he might  consider bulldozing his own house, because it is five feet from the lough shore. That would create some space.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate my party colleague for securing the  Adjournment debate. When I delivered my maiden speech in another place, I was  privileged to detail the breathtaking  beauty of the constituency that I represent, both as MP and MLA,  alongside my three party colleagues. I still feel the same sense of pride as I  drive through that part of the Province, to and from advice centres in  Portavogie, Killyleagh and Saintfield.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have yet to grasp the role that tourism must play in the  development of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s economy. To be fair, we are still  finding our feet after emerging from 40 years of terror and violence that  ensured that tourism was essentially suffocated. At the same time, the  legislative Assembly is still in its infancy. The concept of devolved  Government in Northern    Ireland is still bedding in. Although we can  be excused for being a little behind in practical terms, I am concerned that we  do not yet understand what must be done in order to maximise our tourism  potential; nor do I believe that the matter  is simply one of blind investment in tourism. Rather, it is crucial to  the future success of tourism that a co-ordinated and strategic approach is  adopted in order to facilitate its expansion: only at that point must the  funding that is needed to achieve those goals be identified.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no point complaining that there are no hotels between  Bangor and Portaferry on the Ards Peninsula,  because such businesses are consumer led &mdash; they are not viable without demand.  Until the area&rsquo;s natural and historical assets are maximised, there will remain  insufficient demand.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland  is a blank canvas, compared to the state of  affairs in other parts of the United    Kingdom. Strangford is a case in  point. There are several issues that contribute to that, such as the decline of  traditional industries in the area, the job losses that have resulted, and the  need for new investment. In recent years, we have witnessed the collapse of the  textile industry, which has all but disappeared; the closure of TK-ECC in  Dundonald, and the decline in fortunes of the fishing and farming sectors. As a  result, around 2,500 people have lost their jobs. At the same time, however,  there has been little meaningful inward investment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">People ask themselves where the peace dividend is in all of  that. With the end of the Troubles, and the prospect of a peaceful future, we  were promised huge advances and investment in tourism as overseas visitors  returned to our shores.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That has not yet materialised. In the meantime, the Strangford Lough area &mdash; an area of outstanding  natural beauty &mdash; remains completely relevant as a tourist resource. The  lough is unique in that it is the largest sea lough in the British Isles,  covering approximately 150 square metres and separated from the Irish Sea by  the Ards Peninsula. Its visual beauty is  unquestionable. In the recent ITV competition, &lsquo;Britain&rsquo;s Favourite View&rsquo;, Eddie Irvine described it as:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Swept constantly by Atlantic weather, every single  day is different. For trees, and oceans and hills and greenery, it is hard to  beat.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Scrabo   Tower dominates the area  and gazes out at the glorious panorama of Strangford Lough, its islands, the Mountains of Mourne and the whole of north  Down. Almost completely landlocked, Strangford Lough is rich with the  marine and plant life that revel in the islands, foreshore, salt marshes and  wetlands. The lough is a conservation area, and its abundant wildlife is recognised internationally for its importance.  Animals commonly found in the lough include seals, basking sharks and  brent geese. Three quarters of the world population of brent geese winter in  the lough.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Away from the lough itself, we have the beauty of the  beaches on the Irish Sea side of the Ards   Peninsula. In recent  correspondence, the permanent secretary of the Department of Culture, Arts and  Leisure stated that his Department recognised that our greatest assets are our  unspoilt landscapes, seascapes and the importance of our coastline and beaches.  He stated that beaches attract a diverse range of visitors and activity-users  as well as providing a natural visual amenity, and that it is important that all  visitors have confidence that our waters and beaches are clean and safe.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are at least 12 wonderful beaches on the Ards Peninsula,  which in itself should form a central plank of the area&rsquo;s tourism strategy.  Unfortunately, the water quality at many of those beaches leaves a lot to be  desired because of the pumping of sewage, in some cases untreated, into local  bathing waters. The Department for Regional Development, which is responsible  for waste water and sewage treatment, recently admitted that there is some way  to go to reach the compliance levels that prevail in England. That should have been a  no-brainer. Matters should never have been allowed to reach the point, where,  in the twenty-first century, we still allow raw sewage to be pumped into our  bathing waters.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  No, I will not give way.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Across the Strangford  area, we also have a heritage and a history that remain all but hidden.  The following was written of Sir Hugh Montgomery, who was central in the  Scottish settlement of the area after 1606:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Thus the country where Montgomery  had settled was unhappy and devastated, but he laid balm upon the wounds, and  in a few years he had founded economically sound industries and turned large  portions of Ulster  into a prosperous country.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The history and heritage of the area is essentially an  account of how the Scots influenced local life on economic, social and cultural  levels. The area&rsquo;s built heritage reflects that, whether it be the old cross in  Newtownards &mdash; the only market cross still  in existence outside of Edinburgh &mdash;or the almost fairytale castle in Killyleagh, the ancestral home of the Hamiltons,  whose family, along with that of Sir Hugh Montgomery, settled lands from  Killyleagh to Bangor and from Dundonald to Cloughy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Scots have etched their own identity on the  entire area. The story of Strangford is, therefore, the story of the Scots who  arrived on a barren, depopulated, wasted land and who were responsible for the  establishment and growth of most of the local settlements in the area, not  least Newtownards. Sir Hugh Montgomery, Sir James Hamilton and all those who  followed them to the area left a rich and powerful inheritance: a people whose  first loyalty was to truth and fairness; whose support could never be taken for  granted; who would fight for their freedom and liberty; who were committed to  improving themselves and where they lived; and who brought a diverse array of  cultural expression through music, literature and language, which resonates to  this very day.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, that remains nothing more than tourist potential, a vein of tourist gold that has yet to  be mined. At a time when US  tourists are becoming tired of the old &ldquo;plastic Paddy&rdquo; image that they have  been fed for so long, and as interest in  Scots-Irish heritage increases, we have an unprecedented wealth of  Ulster-Scots history and heritage on our doorstep that is simply waiting to be  exploited.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I find it frustrating that in the likes of Scotland,  tourist attractions and areas of interest are provided for on a comprehensive  scale, utilising all their available resources to attract and entertain  visitors in a co-ordinated and joined-up fashion. There is an absolute wealth  of attractions and history in Strangford, yet we have not even got off the mark  in fulfilling the area&rsquo;s potential.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we have a number of excellent attractions such as Mount  Stewart, Scrabo Tower  and Castle Espie, without a strategic approach to tourism we will never maximise the area&rsquo;s appeal. The Department of Culture,  Arts and Leisure estimates that, at present, tourism is worth &pound;500 million a  year to the Northern Ireland  economy. If addressed properly, that could double.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms McIlveen</strong>:  I commend my hon Friend Mr Hamilton for the positive and enthusiastic manner in  which he has demonstrated the tourism potential not only of my own Strangford  constituency, but of the whole of Northern Ireland, and for the way  in which in he has set it in an economic context. I agree whole&shy;heartedly with  all that he has said.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">7.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland is now rapidly catching up on so  many fronts after decades of terrorism and political instability, and the  tourism deficit presents us all with major  challenges and opportunities. In order to maximise potential, we need to  ensure that the structures are right and that all the key players are singing  from the same hymn sheet. As things stand, our tourism industry is hindered rather than helped by the seemingly  numerous bodies and organisations involved, some of them politically motivated products of the Belfast  Agreement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As a result, therefore, the message is not always as clear  as it might be &mdash; a point that was made by the Northern Ireland Affairs  Committee in its report on tourism in Northern Ireland, published last  year. The tourism industry is a vital cog in our economic wheel, and it deserves efficient, effective and dynamic  strategic leadership. As things stand, I do not think that it is getting  that, and I urge the Minister to address that as soon as possible.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland is a small place. My colleague has  quite rightly drawn attention to the many and varied attractions of the  Strangford area. He has also set these firmly within a broader Northern Ireland  context. The signature projects &mdash; focusing as they do on the main historic and  other main attractions across the Province &mdash; are clearly the key to attracting  out-of-state visitors. We need to be sure that, once those visitors are here,  the infrastructure is in place to encourage and direct them to other  attractions, such as those in my constituency.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure that the tourist attractions of the  Strangford region receive the publicity that they deserve in overseas  marketing. I also feel that support from the Northern Ireland Tourist Board for  the local tourist industry in Strangford and beyond is essential if the  regional tourism partnership for the area is to operate effectively.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Another area that is important if we are to make progress  in tourism is that of good-quality accommo&shy;dation. We are happy to see day  visitors, as others have mentioned, but we are even happier if they decide to  stay for a few days to fully enjoy the many attractions in Strangford. We must ensure that they are comfortable during  such a stay. I would be interested to know <span style="letter-spacing:.05pt; ">whether  the Minister is satisfied that enough is being done</span> to support the  development of the accommodation sector in my constituency.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One of my main concerns &mdash; and my colleague referred to this  &mdash; is that Tourism Ireland, rather than the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, is  responsible for marketing Northern Ireland  in Great Britain.  That is patently absurd. It is little wonder that visitor numbers from Great Britain  are falling. It is not rocket science to work out that the marketing of Northern Ireland in, say, China or California  requires a very different approach to that taken among our fellow citizens  across the Irish Sea. Northern Ireland must be marketed in Great Britain as an integral part of the United Kingdom,  and far more emphasis must be placed on our British history, traditions and  culture. That will not be done while Tourism Ireland  remains in charge of marketing in Great Britain. I encourage the  Minister to strengthen and enhance the role of the Northern Ireland Tourist  Board and to give it back the responsibility for the promotion of Northern Ireland in Great Britain.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington  at the end of June, I was reminded of the closeness of the historical,  religious and family ties between Northern   Ireland and the so-called southern states of the United States of America, such as Virginia, Tennessee and  the Carolinas. There is a vast and largely  untapped tourist potential there. Again, I ask the Minister to do all he can to  ensure that Tourism Ireland markets Northern Ireland positively and  properly in those states. This means that &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Your time is up, sorry.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mr Dodds)</strong>: I congratulate the hon Member Simon  Hamilton for securing this adjournment debate, and I welcome the opportunity to discuss this important issue,  especially at a time when tourism continues to flourish. The Hansard report of  this debate will serve as a wonderful tourist advertisement for Strangford. It  will save the Northern Ireland Tourist Board from having to publish any new pamphlets, because Members have waxed  lyrical and eloquent about the attractions of a very beautiful part of the  world. As has been said, the Strangford constituency is blessed with natural  beauty and plays a central role in making Northern Ireland the attractive  destination that it is.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members mentioned that Strangford Lough featured in the final of the prime time TV show &lsquo;Britain&rsquo;s  Favourite View&rsquo;. It was pipped at the post, but the fact that it was voted among the top four views in the United Kingdom was a tremendous achievement. It underscored  the potential of the area and will serve to advertise Northern Ireland,  particularly Strangford Lough, to a very wide audience. The Northern Ireland  Tourist Board and VisitBritain joined forces for that series to promote the  diversity of landscapes across Northern Ireland  and the rest of the United    Kingdom. Therefore, I hope that people will  be inspired to come and enjoy trips to Strangford Lough and the surrounding  area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Other important tourist attractions have been mentioned,  including: Castle Ward, which is one of Europe&rsquo;s most unique houses; the famous  gardens at Mount Stewart;  and Exploris, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s public aquarium  and seal sanctuary. In 2006, more than 300,000 people visited those  attractions, two of which are in the Strangford constituency. The Tourist Board  and Tourism Ireland continue to work together to organise press trips to those  attractions, thus ensuring that the area remains on the radar of local and  international journalists and obtains positive coverage across the world. The  house and gardens at Mount Stewart, near Greyabbey, have featured prominently in  Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s  global-destination marketing campaign. I understand that Tourism Ireland has  also undertaken an initiative in the market in Great Britain to encourage visitors  to come here with their cars.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have listened carefully to what some Members &mdash;  particularly Ms McIlveen &mdash; said about Tourism Ireland. I am absolutely determined  that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  image be promoted as effectively as possible, so that we can secure the best  possible value for money from our investment in tourism. My Department will  actively examine that. As Members have pointed out, the division of those  promotions has been subject to the institutional legacies of previous  arrangements. I am determined to address the dip in the number of tourists and  visitors who come to Northern Ireland  from Great Britain.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  The Minister has said, rightly, that Strangford  is the jewel in the crown, and some Members have raised issues that must  be addressed. Does the Minister agree that the Ulster-Scots culture should be  exploited and, indeed, enhanced? Every year, 250,000 visitors come from Scotland, and  Ulster-Scots trails could be enhanced to entice visitors to Strangford. As well  as the beauty of Strangford Lough, the culture and history of the place are  attractions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Country sports could also be exploited. Last year, American  tourists spent &pound;50,000 in the Ards Borough Council area during the two-day  Ballywalter game fair. The potential of that event should be exploited, along  with the attractions of the Battletown Gallery and the Eden Pottery Centre.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: I  congratulate the hon Member for managing to compress a speech into an  intervention. However, it is fair that all Members who wished to speak have  been able to contribute to the debate, even though we are constrained by time.  The points that the hon Member has raised, such as Ulster-Scots culture, are  important.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members have mentioned the Smithsonian Folklife  Festival, which I attended, as did Michelle McIlveen and others. We have seen  the tremendous benefits of our participation in that event. It attracted over 1,500,000 visitors, and the tremendous  programme of events at the festival focused on food, music, crafts and landscapes. The Ulster-Scots connection,  particularly to the southern states of America, was very noticeable. The  Strangford constituency featured prominently at that event, with an entire evening devoted to Ballywalter Park, with Lord and Lady Dunleath taking guests on a virtual tour of their  home.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, and the Strangford aspect of  that event, will have a hugely positive impact on tourism here. Members  have mentioned the five signature projects, one  of which is the Christian Heritage/St Patrick project, and they have  rightly pointed to the importance of the Christian heritage in the Strangford  constituency and surrounding area.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">7.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The main focus of that  tourism signature project will be to  increase visitor numbers and spending in Northern Ireland through the development and promotion of key  Christian heritage sites.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the priorities is to develop the St Patrick and  Christian heritage trail, which stretches from Armagh to Bangor. The trail passes through Downpatrick  and links major Christian heritage sights along the way, including Inch Abbey  and Saul, before travelling along the Ards Peninsula where it follows  Strangford Lough, incorporating the impressive Cistercian abbey at Greyabbey on  its way north. Signage for the trail will feature strongly throughout the  constituency, with 15 signs in Newtownards, six in the Greyabbey area and 11  around Portaferry. That signature project has also attracted media  familiarisation trips from across Europe and the United States.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The need to ensure that good accommodation is available and  that there are good skills in the accommodation sector has been mentioned.  There is excellent accommodation and hospitality in the Strangford  constituency. Balloo House in Killinchy won the award for hospitality at the  recent Northern Ireland  tourism awards. The Portaferry Hotel and the Narrows  offer excellent accommodation and cuisine, including a wide selection of local  seafood. I sound like an advertisement for Strangford but it is right to put  those things on record.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Hotels have been mentioned, and it is interesting and good to note that work has started on the  Strangford Arms Hotel in Newtownards, with refurbishment work to be  carried out, which will result in improved accessibility and the creation of an  additional 20 en suite bedrooms. I note the point that Mr Hamilton made about  grant assistance for hotels in the greater Belfast area. I will investigate that point,  and I am happy to take the points that he and others have made about that.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  It would be remiss to forget that in the Castlereagh hills we have the La Mon  House Hotel, which is currently expanding; several million pounds is being  spent to provide additional bedrooms, a spa and a swimming pool.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>:  Yes, that is an excellent point. The major boom in the provision of hotel  bedrooms in the greater Belfast  area is to be welcomed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The need to ensure that events are organised that will draw  in people was mentioned, and that is essential. Recently, I was at Royal County  Down Golf Club, which hosted the Walker Cup between Great   Britain and Ireland  and the USA.  Although that event did not happen in Strangford, it brought many people into  the general locality, and Strangford will have benefited from the worldwide  attention. I know from speaking to people there that they enjoyed their visit  and saw all the attractions and the local area. There are also excellent  courses in the Strangford constituency, such as Scrabo and Kirkistown Castle.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Last week we had the  sixth festival of the Peninsula, which  was organised by Ards Borough Council, who I am happy to congratulate in having  presented once again a splendid variety of all that celebrates the folklore,  music and literature of the area, which I am sure attracted a good number of  visitors. There are many good things happening in Strangford. I congratulate  Members for speaking so eloquently and well of their constituency.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will pick up on a number of points that were raised by  Members, although I will not have time to deal with all of them. The Tourist Board operates a tourism develop&shy;ment  scheme, which can support the develop&shy;ment and expansion of tourist attractions  such as Exploris. The council is, of course, free to explore that possibility.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Tourist Board also  has a victims-of-crime policy to ensure that tourists who are subjected  to crime or antisocial behaviour are looked after and enjoy the rest of their  stay in Northern Ireland.  The antisocial behaviour agenda is wide: it is not only covers tourism, but  also covers the general quality of life of the people of Northern Ireland.  The Armagh and Down tourism partnership is currently undertaking a marine and  coastal strategy for the area, which is almost complete and will include marine tourism opportunities for  Strangford Lough. Any tourism initiative based in Strangford Lough will,  of course, have to take careful account of the Lough&rsquo;s ecological and  scientific importance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Well done to everyone involved in promoting tourism in  Strangford. I congratulate all the efforts that have been made, and I wish you  well for the future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 7.34 pm.</p>
