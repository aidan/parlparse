                revised Budget.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel (Mr
                Durkan):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, with permission, I will make a
                statement about the Executive’s revised Budget for 2002-03 and
                the Executive’s approach to the spending review next year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget statement, as opposed to the
                Budget document, contains some amended figures. An addendum with
                those changes has been sent to the Business Office, and a full
                revised version of the statement will be available to Members as
                soon as possible. This does not affect any of the Budget
                document figures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The plans I am announcing today will underpin
                the Programme for Government, which has been sent to all Members
                this morning. The Executive have set clear priorities for action
                in the Programme for Government, and these are fully reflected
                in the Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I introduced the Executive’s position
                report in June and the draft Budget in September, I made it
                clear that 2002 was a transitional year in which the Executive’s
                Budget planning would be limited by the total resources made
                available by the Treasury in last year’s spending review. In
                December 2000 the Executive published indicative allocations for
                all public services for 2002-03, and these have been reviewed
                during the Budget process. The Executive are working within the
                same total, apart from additional allocations as a result of the
                Chancellor’s recent announcement — to which I will return
                later. Despite the absence of any significant change in the
                resources available, the Executive are determined to make a
                specific mark through the Budget for 2002-03.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may be helpful if I remind Members about
                some of the features of the draft Budget presented in September.
                The Executive had £42·8 million available for allocation. This
                amount came from the Chancellor’s March Budget and as a result
                of reduced departmental requirements. The Executive proposed to
                supplement that amount with £48 million of planned carry-over
                from the in-year monitoring rounds in 2001-02. These amounts,
                together with a small reduction of £1·8 million in the
                indicative allocation for the Department for Social Development,
                gave the Executive £92·6 million to allocate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In making use of this money, the Executive
                gave significant priority to health, schools and roads in the
                draft Budget plans. This is confirmed in the revised proposals I
                am announcing today. The Executive have been able to increase
                allocations for 2002-03 by £37·2 million and have been able to
                boost health spending in 2001-02 by £8 million. Later today I
                will announce the Executive’s decisions on the second round of
                allocations from the Executive programme funds. Taken together,
                these decisions will show that the Executive have acted clearly
                and decisively to address some of the key Programme for
                Government objectives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive have been determined to
                increase scope for comment and consultation on this year’s
                Budget process. Of course, Statutory Committees can question and
                analyse spending issues at any time. They do not need to await a
                starting pistol from me or from any Minister in order to
                initiate scrutiny on what areas Departments are spending money
                on, or on whether public services are serving the public in the
                best possible way. The range of issues that could be expressed
                will undoubtedly far exceed the time and scope available to
                Committees, even within the extended timetable for the Budget
                process. I encourage Committees to have an ongoing and
                continuous agenda of scrutiny in relation to aspects of spending
                programmes, including planning and targeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To facilitate the process of consultation and
                scrutiny, the Executive put forward a position report in June
                2001 to draw out the main features of spending plans and provide
                a structured starting point for discussion. That was to ensure
                that when the draft Budget was presented in September, the
                Executive were not starting cold and that people in the Assembly
                and in the community could view the proposals against the
                backcloth of the issues that were presented in the position
                report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people have responded positively and
                carefully to the Budget proposals presented in September. In
                particular, I thank the Committee for Finance and Personnel,
                which has brought together a timely and important report,
                drawing out some major themes from its own deliberations and the
                comments and recommendations received from other Statutory
                Committees. On behalf of the Executive I thank the other
                Committees for their contribution to this important process. I
                hope that they share my belief that it has been a better process
                than was possible last year. Nevertheless, there are further
                lessons to be learnt from this cycle, and they will be valuable
                lessons in what will be an important process next year. I will
                talk more about that shortly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would be surprised if anyone who has
                attended any of our discussions on financial issues in recent
                weeks would disagree that there is extensive concern about the
                current level of health expenditure. Health and personal social
                services represent 40% of our expenditure. The Executive gave
                significant prioritisation to health spending in the draft
                Budget. Demands and expectations on health services in societies
                such as ours are expanding rapidly. People rightly want the best
                standard of care, treatment and service available for themselves
                and their loved ones to alleviate suffering, improve life
                expectancy and provide dignity and comfort in extreme
                circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive have increased spending on
                health significantly since devolution. In 2002-03, spending will
                be £687 million more, or 37% higher, than it was in 1998-99. We
                also provided non-recurrent additions of £48 million during
                2000-01 and £42 million in the two monitoring rounds so far in
                2001-02.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These amounts are large, but the bulk of the
                extra money is required to meet the cost of providing essential
                services. The fact that the Executive have provided extra
                funding when we have many other demands for spending on public
                services shows clearly the importance we attach to the Health
                Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have allocated to health everything that
                came to us via Barnett from the increases attributable to it in
                England in last year’s spending review, and more. However,
                because of the arithmetic of the Barnett formula, it still did
                not result in as big a percentage as that of the previous year
                in England. Yet the Health Service here has to address greater
                needs and hence costs more than it does in England. We must look
                at how it is managed and organised, and the Executive have asked
                for extensive work to be done on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Finance and Personnel, the
                Economic Policy Unit and the Department of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety are engaged in the most extensive and
                thorough analysis of health needs and expenditure that has been
                undertaken in Northern Ireland for many years. We depend on the
                health needs and effectiveness evaluation for guidance on how
                best to spend money on health in the future and to provide clear
                understanding of the differences between what happens here and
                elsewhere. For many years it was thought that health spending
                and standards of service were relatively high here. There is no
                doubt that they have been eroded over recent years. We cannot
                take that lightly, and thoughtful analysis and discussion are
                needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not enough simply to put money into the
                Health Service. Many people rightly ask how the resources that
                have already been provided have been used. The Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety has provided detailed
                information on that, and the evaluation process will continue to
                explore it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As with all public services, there are
                problems with management and efficiency which must be addressed.
                The way in which the services are organised begs many questions.
                Hard choices must be made which will affect the standard of care
                and the nature of hospital provision in the region. We must
                address these issues seriously and thoughtfully. The Executive,
                no less than the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety, are determined to find the best way to proceed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week the Chancellor of the Exchequer
                announced an additional £1 billion for the Health Service in
                the United Kingdom. As a result, we have received a Barnett
                amount of £27·8 million. Although we heard of this only after
                we had taken our own main decisions, the Executive moved quickly
                to confirm the way ahead. We are not obliged to make use of
                money from Barnett for the same purpose as such money is used in
                England — that is central to the point of devolution. No
                matter what we think of it otherwise, the Barnett system gives
                us the distinct advantage of regional discretion as a devolved
                Administration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the case of the Health Service, we have
                decided on an increase in funding which is significantly larger
                than the amount provided by the Treasury. Making use of our
                allocations — including the Executive programme fund
                allocations that I will announce later today — and new money
                from the Treasury, we are providing an extra £41 million over
                and above the amounts that were announced in the draft Budget.
                We are also acting straight away. Members may recall that the
                increase for health which was proposed in the draft Budget was
                made possible only by planning to carry over some money from
                2001-02. Of the total of £48 million that we planned to handle
                in that way, £31·1 million was for health. Because of the
                additional provision that we are making for 2002-03, we can add
                £8 million to the health budget this year instead of holding it
                back until 2002-03. This means that the service and, more
                importantly, those in need of treatment and care can begin to
                benefit immediately from the extra money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I emphasise that that has been made possible
                through the Executive’s planned additions to the health budget
                for next year. While the pre-Budget report has allowed those
                plans to be accelerated and the scale to be increased, we will
                not simply play follow-my-leader with the Treasury. The result
                is that the allocation for health in 2002-03 will be £72
                million higher than the figures in the June position report,
                including the Executive programme fund allocations that I will
                announce this afternoon.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite very tight constraints, we have met
                more than half the health bids that were lodged at the time of
                the position report. Compared with the plans made this time last
                year for 2001-02, and including the two rounds of allocations
                from the Executive programme funds, there will be an increase of
                £224 million or 9·7%. On 25 September I explained that those
                figures include £19 million that was transferred from the
                social security budget. Thus, the true cash increase is £205
                million or 8·9%. As in the past, most of that money is needed
                to cover rises in the costs of providing services, such as
                inflation rises over which we have limited control. However, it
                will provide some £41 million of service development for health
                and personal social services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new money will be used to provide several
                particular developments, including some £13 million for
                community services, which will allow additional community care
                places for older people. That will address some issues that have
                been raised about the appropriateness of care and the effect of
                deficiencies in community care on acute hospitals. It is vital
                that hospitals can use their services as effectively as
                possible, but that is difficult if the community care needs of
                older people are not being met.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An additional £12·4 million is being
                allocated to enable hospitals to address some critical issues,
                including the treatment of heart disease and cancer and the
                provision of extra beds so that more patients can receive urgent
                treatment. A further £2 million is being provided for
                much-needed children’s services and family services,
                especially for the most vulnerable people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to confirm that we can now
                proceed with the introduction of free nursing care for the
                elderly, subject to the necessary legislation’s being passed
                through the Assembly. That will cost some £4·5 million for
                2002-03, although the full cost for the year will be about £9
                million. That will surely be welcomed by all who care about the
                interests of older people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive’s proposals represent a major
                commitment to meeting the needs of the Health Service. No one
                pretends that those additions, substantial though they are, will
                solve all the problems in the Health Service. We must also take
                account of the important work on health funding and management
                that is being done in both England and the South to develop the
                best strategy for our context. How we proceed for the longer
                term remains to be decided. We must take account of the
                available resources and the conclusions of the needs and
                effectiveness evaluation next year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are only a few other changes from the
                spending allocations in the draft Budget. I confirm that the £2
                million required by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure
                for the cost of job evaluation in libraries will be provided. As
                I briefly explained in my statement on the September monitoring
                rounds, it has become clear, through a job evaluation exercise
                undertaken by the education and library boards, that the pay of
                junior library personnel will have to be increased. The boards
                made a commitment to backdate the job evaluation to 1 January
                1995. Now that that process is complete, those payments will be
                made. It was clearly impossible for the libraries’ budget to
                absorb that substantial additional cost. Several Members had
                concerns about that when the September monitoring round was
                announced. However, it represents a clear contractual
                entitlement based on an objective evaluation of the library
                staff’s work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, it is now possible to restore
                the £2 million of provision for the Department of the
                Environment’s resources grant to district councils. That will
                avoid the need for a reduction, and it will bring the increase
                for that Department’s budget up to 10% when compared to
                provision in 2001-02. The Executive concluded that it would be
                desirable to use the flexibility that has become available to
                ensure that full assistance to the poorest council areas is
                restored.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have added £1·4 million to the social
                inclusion/ community regeneration fund to provide for a
                Department of Education bid for provision for primary two
                classroom assistants. That will be covered in detail in my
                statement on the Executive programme funds this afternoon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The additional allocations in 2002-03 amount
                to £37·2 million, which, together with the £8 million for
                health in 2001-02, makes a total of £45·2 million. The
                resources required to cover those additions come from four
                sources. These are: the additional £27·8 million from the
                pre-Budget report, which we are allocating to health; the £5·4
                million that has been made available through a reclassification
                of some costs relating to Laganside; the setting of targets for
                Departments to increase asset sales in 2002-03 by £5 million,
                which will release additional resources; and our anticipation
                that £7 million will be found from reduced requirements in some
                departmental allocations at a relatively early stage in 2002-03.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the remaining Departments, and for the
                North/South bodies, the allocations agreed by the Executive in
                the revised Budget remain as proposed in September. The plenary
                meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council on Friday 30
                November adopted an initial opinion on the budgets for the six
                bodies for 2002. Those are reflected in the Budget proposals
                before the Assembly and will be kept under review in the in-year
                monitoring process, as will those for Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development’s allocation will be £204 million, which includes
                provision for BSE testing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment will have a total of £256 million, although, as I
                indicated on 25 September, that will be kept under review to
                take account of the implications of changes in the economic
                context.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With an allocation of £117 million, the
                Department of Finance and Personnel will be funded to provide
                the central finance and personnel functions and the necessary
                support services for Departments and the public for which it is
                responsible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The £619 million allocated to the Department
                for Employment and Learning will provide for the planned
                expansion of further and higher education places and measures to
                broaden access to further and higher education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Regional Development has a
                14·8% increase over its 2001-02 allocation, which includes
                substantial provision for the purchase of new trains. That is a
                clear demonstration of the priority that we are giving to roads
                and transport. The Chancellor’s decision to phase in the
                aggregates tax will lead to a cost saving for the Department,
                which shows that a difference can be made by ensuring that the
                Treasury addresses the regional consequences of taxation
                measures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Social Development’s
                budget of £450 million represents a 7·5% increase over the
                2001-02 provision. It includes substantial provision for welfare
                reform and modernisation, as well as for housing measures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister will have a budget of £33 million, which
                includes provision for key research on equality and policy
                effectiveness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some pressure has been applied, especially by
                the Committee for Finance and Personnel, and comment has been
                made that departmental estimating processes are not as good as
                they should be and that there is a pattern of monitoring rounds
                yielding additional room to manoeuvre. That is indeed the case,
                and the Executive are well aware of the issues that that
                highlights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will consider carefully, in the course of
                next year’s spending review, how best to take account of the
                pattern of underspending, and we will take steps to ensure that
                our resource planning is as effective and sound as possible.
                Money should be directed to where it is really needed, and our
                priorities should be fulfilled. The pattern of recent monitoring
                rounds suggests that it is entirely prudent to make use of a sum
                on the scale of £7 million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there are always some uncertainties
                that cannot be covered in the Budget allocations. These include
                some technical issues in the expenditure of the Northern Ireland
                Housing Executive that may give rise to monitoring bids next
                year. These, and the routine costs of the Departments,
                non-departmental public bodies and the North/South bodies must
                be taken into account. The possibility of developments in the
                Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment’s budget, which
                is always more difficult to predict than the more routine
                recurrent budgets of other Departments, must also be taken into
                account.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In September, we decided to plan on the basis
                that some underspending would be carried from this year to next
                year in order to part-finance next year’s plans. That is
                necessary to ensure that the cost pressures identified for the
                year ahead can be covered adequately. It is a responsible use of
                the end-year flexibility arrangements that are designed to make
                the best use of the resources available, rather than their being
                drawn to areas of opportunity as opposed to areas of priority.
                In next year’s spending review, we must consider how best to
                adapt that approach for the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That concludes my proposals for the spending
                allocations for 2002-03. They represent a clear statement of the
                Executive’s determination to address the problems in the
                Health Service and to maximise the resources available to public
                services. As Minister of Finance and Personnel, I am in favour
                of public services, and I believe that my successor will carry
                forward the determined work to ensure that we can make the most
                of our Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind the Assembly that there will be a
                full-scale spending review by the Treasury next year. It will
                address the spending plans for the period from 2003-04 to
                2005-06. Our work, within our departmental expenditure limit
                will take place in that context. The review is likely to affect
                the total resources available to us in that period. However, the
                Chancellor of the Exchequer has made it clear that we cannot
                expect as rapid a period of growth in spending as has been the
                case since 1999-2000, which was the first year of the plans set
                in the 1998 comprehensive spending review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many ways, the devolved Administration had
                the good fortune of coming into office when spending was growing
                rapidly. As I said on 25 September, we cannot expect that to
                continue, and we must be able to adapt our ways to deal with a
                different situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive are determined to use the
                opportunity of next year’s spending review to make a clear and
                significant difference to spending plans for Northern Ireland’s
                public services. The work will be informed by the needs and
                effectiveness evaluations. These already cover health, schools,
                vocational education and training, industry and housing and
                amount to 70% of the total departmental expenditure limit. The
                Executive recently agreed that there should also be a study of
                the programmes of the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to these six evaluations, we will
                take account of the work on the future of the agrifood sector by
                the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s vision
                group and the work of the Department for Regional Development on
                the regional transportation strategy. These strands of detailed
                analysis, together with the usual processes of bidding and
                scrutiny for all services, will ensure that the spending review
                will be truly fundamental.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A spending review should mean change —
                changing priorities to take account of what our society needs
                and wants most. We have an immense responsibility to address
                that seriously and thoughtfully. The answers are not obvious,
                nor will the decisions be easy.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To emphasise our determination to make a
                difference, we are publishing indicative minima, rather than
                spending plans, for allocations to Departments for 2003-04. We
                have taken about £125 million from the previous departmental
                indicative figures. That will be held by the Executive for
                allocation next September following a thorough root-and-branch
                analysis of where the money is needed most. It will take time
                for Departments, Executive Ministers, Assembly Committees and
                others to work through the analysis. The process is likely to
                lead to radical decisions being made on spending allocations. I
                invite the Assembly to view the process as beginning today. It
                is a major challenge that will give us a substantial opportunity
                to make our mark on public services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amounts allocated to all Departments for
                2003-04 are well below the amounts required to sustain the level
                of service that we propose for 2002-03. That does not mean that
                we intend to make spending cuts. On the contrary, we are
                determined to ensure the growth of public services, so we need
                to ask which programmes need resources most and in what areas we
                most want to develop public services. It is likely that some
                reductions will be required in areas in which money can be
                better used in new or different ways. Certain objectives that
                took priority may have been broadly achieved. We do not look for
                change for change’s sake, but for change that will benefit
                public services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have calculated the indicative minima in
                ways that take account of each aspect of the Budget. We have
                also taken into account the spending patterns that will be set
                in 2002-03; those include some substantial changes from the
                current year. It follows that the indicative plans that we
                published last year are no longer valid and need a radical
                overhaul. Spending can go down as well as up. That does not mean
                that something was wrong — it simply shows that priorities
                change, and we must adjust if we are to respond to need and get
                the best from the public services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall not detail how the indicative figures
                were derived. It suffices to say that they take account of the
                characteristics of Budgets — pay bills are difficult to change
                quickly, and it is easier to make adjustments to capital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In setting the indicative minima, we have
                held back a lower proportion of the amounts allocated to health
                and schools. That recognises the fact that, as well as having
                the characteristics that apply to all Departments, those two
                services are particular priorities, and it would be unrealistic
                to hold back a substantial percentage of the amounts set aside
                for them. However, there is no question of their facing less
                demanding scrutiny. On the contrary, we have given priority to
                them in the needs and effectiveness evaluations, because it is
                vital that their large share of the Budget is used as
                effectively as possible. Evaluations become more important as
                the amounts increase.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must emphasise that the amount held for
                allocation, which we call the Executive’s SR2002 allocation,
                is in two distinct parts: one for resources and one for capital.
                That shows our determination to ensure that the amount for
                capital will be allocated to capital. If possible, we should
                seek to move some provision from resources to capital to
                increase the level of activity. That could proceed in
                conjunction with further work on public-private partnerships (PPPs),
                depending on the conclusions that we reach after the PPP review
                next year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In setting indicative minima, our approach
                included all the Departments of the Executive and the North/
                South bodies. I invite the appropriate authorities in the
                Assembly to consider whether a similar approach to the spending
                of the Assembly and the Northern Ireland Audit Office might be
                appropriate, so that next year’s spending review makes the
                best possible plans for the longer term.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next spending review will mark the end of
                the beginning of devolution. The conclusions that we reach this
                time next year will give us a new direction that will assist us
                in 2005-06. That will coincide with the conclusion of the
                existing round of EU structural funds. It will be a vital period
                of planning for our society, one in which we can address the
                major economic and social issues that affect our region. The
                Executive remain determined to deliver on the objectives set out
                in the Programme for Government, and it will become increasingly
                clear that our spending plans follow the priorities set out in
                the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been my privilege to present and
                explain the Executive’s financial decisions to the Assembly on
                many occasions. I thank Members for the attention and care that
                they have given to those issues during my time as Minister of
                Finance and Personnel. I know that I can rely on Members to give
                my successor a similarly thoughtful and questioning response. I
                commend the proposals to the Assembly. Members have a week to
                discuss and consider them further before I put down a motion to
                seek approval of the revised Budget on Tuesday 11 December.</p>

                has been able to put additional money into health, over and
                above the amount allocated by the Chancellor, shows that a
                review of the Barnett formula is necessary and that having a
                local Assembly gives us the opportunity to make our own
                decisions, especially on health issues? Can he ensure that the
                money that has been ring-fenced for health — as announced by
                the Chancellor — will go to health? Patients are real people,
                and they need real care. We need new money — and real money
                — to ensure that that vital service is maintained.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister also confirm that the
                allocation of £8 million of direct money that was announced
                today is over and above the £14 million that he announced in
                the September review?</p>

                grant to the 16 poorer councils. Does the Minister agree that a

                would have had a devastating effect and would have created a
                real crisis for many councils whose resources are already under

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What steps will the Minister and the
                Executive consider taking before negotiations begin on the 2002

                allocations meet future needs?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Molloy for his initial comments.
                As Minister of Finance and Personnel, I have been happy to
                listen carefully to debates in the Chamber and to the Committee
                for Finance and Personnel. That is not only an indication that I
                am a good listener; it is also an indication that good points
                have been raised. The Executive have been able to reflect
                positively those issues in the revised Budget. We have been able
                to translate our stated priority for health into further
                allocations, which I believe is welcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr Molloy pointed out, if the Barnett
                formula worked differently and more in our favour, we would be
                able to allocate even more money to health and to our regional
                priority. There has been some misunderstanding about that —
                every penny that we receive from the Barnett formula for health
                goes to health. Moreover, we allocate still more, as the revised
                Budget shows. I can confirm that the £8 million that will be
                allocated to this year’s health budget is additional to the
                £14·3 million that was allocated in the September monitoring
                round.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, since the draft Budget a further
                £22 million has been allocated to health this year and a
                further £41 million to the health budget for next year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Work on the needs and effectiveness
                evaluation is laying the groundwork for the consideration we
                shall undertake for the 2002 spending review. I hope that
                Committees will soon start to address the 2002 spending review
                from their perspective.</p>

                that were available to us. The Department declared that change.
                The impression seems to be that some drive-by cuts are taking
                place by my, or somebody else’s, hands. The £5·4 million
                reduced requirement has been used to make the changes that we

                community services. Those include the additional community care
                places for older people, which will reduce the massive pressure

                by central Government should be spent on health in Northern
                Ireland? In England, 2% more is spent on health. The Chancellor
                of the Exchequer announced an additional £1 billion for health.

                statement later on Executive programme funds. However, with that
                new money and the money from the programme funds, can the

                agree that we are still £50 million short of the Department’s
                bids for the extra £122 million needed to maintain the services
                in 2002-03? Those services may continue to deteriorate. I
                welcome the Minister’s positive statement.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive have used every penny — and
                more — that was allocated for health in the Barnett formula to
                improve services. Let us be clear about that. I have said that a
                total of £27·8 million will go towards health. In fact, we can
                now allocate £41 million more for health for next year than was
                allocated in the draft Budget, which means £72 million more
                than was reflected in the position report. That goes a long way
                towards meeting more than half of the bids referred to by the
                Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety. That £41 million extra for next year will allow
                for service development in several areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said in the draft Budget that the
                allocation would not be sufficient to allow much service
                development and that services would just stand still. However,
                that allocation has been raised to allow for service
                development. The Member’s assertion that £50 million more is
                needed just to maintain existing services is not true.
                Approximately £41 million of real service development can take
                place as a result of the additional allocations in the revised
                Budget.</p>

                response. It is a different matter if a Member wishes to press
                the Minister on an unsatisfactory answer. However, a simple

                final detailed proposals will emerge from that. It is not the
                only review exercise of that nature that could have resource
                implications, depending on the final proposals. As with the
                other exercises, the decisions on financial allocations will be
                made in the light of the proposals that we have received. I have
                made no secret of the fact that the Budget does not include
                additional resources for the outcome of the vision exercise. The
                Executive have already agreed that the need for resources will
                be considered following the consultation exercise. People may
                have accused us of pre-empting the outcome if we had fixed a
                particular allocation. In spring, when the results of that
                exercise become available and a draft action plan has been
                developed, the Executive will address the resource issues. That

                to the trusts and boards under the health budget, given that we
                now have a Committee, an Assembly of 108 Members, and a Health
                Department? The money would be better spent on health than on
                the administration of health boards.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not for me, as Minister of Finance and
                Personnel, to start proposing structures for health and personal
                social services. The issue of the number of trusts and boards et
                cetera is touched on in the Hayes report, which is the subject
                of consultation. The Minister of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety will introduce the relevant proposals on that. The
                Executive will initiate a review of public administration in a
                wholesale way next spring, and that has implications for those
                issues. We are determined to ensure that as much money as
                possible goes to the services and not to the structures.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will be aware that the
                Chairperson of the Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                Committee has said publicly on at least two occasions recently
                that our Health Service is on the brink of disaster. It is also
                a matter of public record that our waiting lists for acute
                services — heart, cancer and orthopaedic treatment — are
                longer than in any other part of the United Kingdom. Indeed,
                elective orthopaedic services have been suspended for lengthy
                periods in the three major orthopaedic units.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In paragraph 10 of his statement, the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the money spent to date has not
                alleviated, but rather increased, our difficulties. In paragraph
                38, the Minister says that</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In many ways, the devolved

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a hint that spending will be cut
                back in the next spending review. In those circumstances, does
                the Minister think that the current provision for health will do
                anything significant, in the absence of fundamental reform, to
                increase the quality of the Health Service?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bed blocking was the subject of the £1
                billion payment announced by the Chancellor in England and the
                allocation of £13 million to community care services. Is the
                Minister aware that a bed occupied in an acute hospital costs
                about £1,200 per week and that a bed in a private nursing home
                could be obtained for less than half that? The beds are not
                being filled because of the absence of reform in hospital
                administration and because of the multiplicity of trusts.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has raised several points. In
                budgetary terms, considerably more money is being spent on
                health this year than was the case in the year before
                devolution, and that was reflected in my statement. The Member
                suggests that that money makes the problem worse. Extra money
                does not make any problems worse. Yes, it is true that not all
                the problems are to do with funding; there are issues that
                relate to planning, management and service structures.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is for the Minister of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety to deal with those issues. As the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel, I am dealing with budgetary
                issues, working with my Executive Colleagues. Many of the points
                that the Member has raised are for my ministerial Colleagues to
                answer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that the additional money now
                being allocated to community services should be of assistance in
                regard to bed blocking. This goes back to the initiative taken
                by the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in
                December 1999, when there were acute winter pressures. Various
                reviews were undertaken, and we are now seeing the outworking of
                some of those considerations in the allocations that we are
                making.</p>

                Minister referred to the spending review in his statement. I
                welcome that if it means that we are moving away from the
                failures of past spending patterns and will be developing more
                vigorous spending plans that accurately reflect need. Does the
                Minister agree that, to date, the Executive have failed to
                prioritise health and to address adequately the needs of a
                Health Service in crisis? Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not accept that the Executive have
                failed to prioritise health. In circumstances where health
                spending next year will be 37% higher than it was before the
                Executive existed, no one can say that we have failed, in
                budgetary terms, to prioritise health. We have always been
                honest with the Assembly about the difficulties of getting the
                room to manoeuvre in order to prioritise effectively.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member’s comments on the spending
                review are correct. We must make more of our total allocation
                available to meet, and to focus more heavily on, our regional
                priorities. However, making money available in that way is not
                easy when Members, across all parties and Committees, move
                defensively to insist that the previous Budget lines of their
                particular Departments must be protected. Many people work on
                the assumption that prioritisation is something that is done
                with new additional money and not by looking at whether all
                baselines can continue to be justified in the light of pressing
                priorities. Given what Dr O’Hagan has said, I look forward
                next year to hearing her and many other Colleagues joining with
                the Executive to ensure that we look seriously at spending in
                all Departments so that we can release as much money as possible
                to the most pressing priorities.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the allocation, additional to the
                draft Budget, of £72 million to health and social services, and
                particularly the 17·3% increase in the allocation to personal
                social services. In his statement the Minister referred to the
                extensive work undertaken by the Department of Finance and
                Personnel, the Economic Policy Unit and the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety on an assessment of
                how health services are managed and organised. Can he tell the
                House when this analysis will be completed, so that we can have
                greater confidence in the effectiveness of health expenditure?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister also assure the House that
                in such a review he will address the inequality in the current
                system of allocating community health and social services
                funding? It has produced huge variations between different
                community health and social services trusts and has resulted in
                the underfunding of the Homefirst Community Health and Social
                Services Trust, which serves my constituency.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to clarify that £72 million more has
                been made available than was indicated in the position report.
                It is £41 million more than was in the draft Budget. Both
                figures are significant and welcome improvements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bearing in mind next year’s spending review
                and considering that many Members have mentioned the Barnett
                formula, our first concern in the needs and effectiveness
                evaluation exercise is to come forward with details on needs. We
                hope to do that early in the new year. The further detailed work
                on effectiveness will take another couple of months. It is not
                that that work has not begun, but that we had to ensure, in
                getting to grips with all the issues, that we had sufficient
                information on need to commence our discussions on the Treasury
                spending review. Therefore, the effectiveness evaluation will
                come forward later in the spring and will be available for the
                Executive and the Committees to work on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The allocations within Departments — as
                between trusts — is not a matter for the Department of Finance
                and Personnel. All Departments have their equality schemes and
                obligations. All spending should be equality proofed, but the
                responsibility for that falls to each Department and not to the
                Department of Finance and Personnel.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I compliment the Minister for the clarity and
                precision of the revised Budget statement. All Members who have
                spoken so far have welcomed the substantive additional funding
                given to the Department of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety. Can the Minister tell us when a report on the joint
                review set up in February 2001, involving the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the Department of
                Finance and Personnel, will be made. While all Members have
                welcomed the additional substantive money being added to the
                health budget in the current year and next year, there is
                concern about how effectively it is being spent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that he hopes that the
                needs and effectiveness review will be completed soon. Does he
                agree that that will set different patterns of expenditure in
                the future and that it will perhaps do away with, or break, the
                pre-devolution, predetermined expenditure that Departments
                currently appear to have as their dogma?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The needs and effectiveness evaluation covers
                a range of programmes across various Departments — over 70% of
                the total Budget. The Department of Finance and Personnel, the
                Economic Policy Unit and the Department of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety are working together in relation to
                health and social services. It is hoped that findings on need
                can be brought forward early in the new year, with findings on
                effectiveness following in the spring.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be wrong for me to pre-empt the
                precise implications of that, and I do not want to speak out of
                turn, given the role of a particular Department and another
                Minister here. However, it is our shared intent that the outcome
                of the needs and effectiveness evaluation will mean that the
                Executive are better able to assure themselves and the Assembly
                that they are matching resources to need and using resources to
                meet need rather than to sustain inherited patterns.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for the

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 25 September, as Chairperson of the
                Committee for the Environment, I asked a question on the justice
                of the proposal to cut £2 million from the resources grant
                payable to the poorest district councils. No one at that time
                could understand the unwarranted intrusion into the poorest
                district council funds or how the Department could even
                contemplate it, so it was condemned. The effective working of
                the Committee for the Environment exposed that iniquity, and the
                Committee can be proud of its success in bringing the matter to
                the forefront of debate. However, one issue still concerns the
                Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister assure the House that the
                allocation necessary for compliance with EU legislation on waste
                management will be ring-fenced and that none of it will be
                handed back by the Department, as happened this year? That is
                causing considerable concern, bearing in mind that we are facing
                infraction proceedings from Europe on waste management.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is correct on the first point. He
                drew attention to this matter on 25 September by quoting the
                Minister of the Environment, who had referred to the point in
                his press release that day. Various representations have been
                received since then. It was precisely due to pressures on
                environmental issues, particularly waste management, that the
                Department — based on what looked like being the draft Budget
                allocation — had to concentrate on meeting EU requirements.
                That led to the squeeze in the resource grant; it was not a
                question of anyone’s deciding to cut the council resource
                grant. With additional money, we have now been able to reverse
                that particular implication.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as ring-fencing is concerned, money
                allocated for a particular purpose is used for that purpose.
                Ring-fencing means that if money cannot be spent for a
                particular purpose, the money is handed back. Keeping money to
                do what one wants with it is not ring-fencing. If the Member
                wants assurance that money is given for a purpose — with a
                determination that it be spent on that purpose — this is the
                view of the Department of the Environment and the Department of
                Finance and Personnel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If, for whatever reason, spending levels are
                not able to use all that money in a year, that will declare
                itself in a monitoring round. That is the right and proper way
                of maintaining Budget scrutiny and is consistent with many other
                points that have been made in the Chamber.</p>

                too welcome the Minister’s statement. However, with regard to
                the Budget allocation for the Department for Social Development,
                if our aim is to tackle disadvantage and build communities, how
                does the Minister expect to see the achievement of this
                worthwhile aspiration if he cuts the budget for objective C,
                Urban Regeneration/ Community Development?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been a decrease in the Department
                for Social Development’s budget, and that is made worse in
                real terms by the increase in spending on administration.
                Therefore, there is less money to be spent on the ground. I
                refer the Minister to paragraph 33 of his statement where he
                stated that money should go where it is really needed. It is
                needed for housing and community development and for the
                improvement of the social well-being of the most disadvantaged
                in our society, and not necessarily for administration fees.</p>

                technical change in the treatment of Laganside expenditure and
                was brought forward by the Department for Social Development.
                Members must remember that Laganside spending comes under
                objective C. Some of that spending would not necessarily be what
                many of us might regard as frontline community development and
                community regeneration expenditure. People assume that only
                particular types of services and spend are being hit in this
                way.</p>

                issues regarding the Housing Executive, we anticipate that there
                will be further in-year bids for housing, as has been the case
                previously. The Executive will continue to make good their
                commitments to meet housing need. Obviously, housing is one of
                the programmes subject to the needs and effectiveness
                evaluation. We will give further consideration to the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">None of these moneys will be treated as
                confetti currency. If any Committee has reason to believe that a
                Department is treating money in that way, I rely on that
                Committee to bring the problem to light.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said in reply to Dr McCrea, moneys are
                allocated for specific purposes, and where Departments diverge
                significantly from that because they are not able to spend in a
                particular area, that should be declared. When variations are
                disclosed, Members should not make it a big issue. It is good
                financial management for Departments to make such savings known,
                and the Executive are then able to redirect available money to
                other programme areas. Members may feel more reassured that
                spending management is in line with stated plans when the needs
                and effectiveness evaluation results feed into the spending
                review.</p>

                probably, his last.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There should be no doubt about the Minister’s
                commitment to health and education. Can he summarise how much
                additional money has been given to these Departments since
                devolution?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not have precise figures at my
                fingertips. It depends whether we are considering two Budgets or
                three, as I provided a carry-over Budget in December 1999. We
                will make the figures available to the Member. There has been a
                significant increase in health spending.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those two Departments are dealing with
                serious pressures, and the additional money that we have made
                available will not alleviate all those pressures. Rising costs
                in existing services and demands for new services have been
                factors, and acute pressures express themselves in different
                areas. I will not imply that we have done enough for those
                services and priorities, just as I recognise that there are many
                services in other Departments for which Members would like to
                see more funding.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has made a lengthy statement
                about the Health Service, and many people have concerns about
                the funding of that Department. The Minister said that the
                Barnett formula would give some £27 million extra. Can he
                advise whether the money given to the Health Service will be
                sufficient to bring it into line with the UK mainland? My
                information is that our health budget is already 9% shy of the
                UK average. Does the announced increase bring us into line with
                the national average?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In paragraph 17 of his statement the Minister
                referred to £13 million for community services and the
                provision of care places for older people. This year, the Ulster
                Community and Hospitals Trust needs £3 million simply to cover
                costs. It is playing catch up. Does the Minister believe that
                £13 million is a sufficient allocation for 19 trusts and four
                board areas? What funding will be made available for winter
                provision? The Health Service has increased problems at this
                time of the year, relating to flu and other such ailments. What
                funding will be made available to provide extra nursing homes,
                beds, and step-down packages?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have pointed out to other Members, much
                of the detail of Mr Shannon’s questions are for another
                Minister. It is not for me, therefore, to explain how that money
                will be spent, particularly with regard to boards and trusts.
                The relevant Minister and Department make those allocations
                through the appropriate structures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one is pretending that any allocation is
                adequate to cover every need that arises. The draft Budget
                allocation for health did not allow for service development. A
                further allocation now allows for that development. However, I
                do not pretend that all service needs will be met. There were
                other bids from the Department of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety that could not be met. The further allocation for
                community care is aimed at supporting additional residential
                placements and domiciliary care packages. The effectiveness and
                extent of the impact of those services depends on how they are
                delivered.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted that the Budget allocation for
                fuel poverty has increased from £4 million to £8 million. That
                is a wonderful example of how the Assembly can correct a problem
                that is particular to the Province, which has high fuel costs
                and a high level of fuel poverty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not suggest that the Minister resign, as
                so many have tried that already. However, I am concerned about
                the discrepancy between figures that he gave to the Assembly
                previously and those that appear in the Budget — Laganside,
                for example, and the Housing Executive. I wish to make a special
                plea about the Housing Executive. I do not have the figures, but
                I do recall that in the last year’s Budget statement the
                revenue created by the sale of Housing Executive houses was over
                £100 million. Departments other than the Department for Social
                Development benefited from about 50% of that money. The
                technical bid in the monitoring rounds will be for housing. I
                hope that more than 50% of the proceeds of house sales will go
                towards the Department for Social Development.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for a nice try.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That point has been discussed before on the
                housing programme and the moneys raised from house sales. In
                setting a Budget, the Executive must make an assumption about
                the amount of revenue raised from the sale of Housing Executive
                houses, just as an amount of money is assumed from Housing
                Executive rents. When the Budget is examined, it should be
                realised that it is a public expenditure commitment. Other
                moneys will go into the total housing programme. I do not
                believe that I can give a commitment about a specific percentage
                or fixed proportion of any additional revenue from house sales
                that should go towards the housing programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is well known that not every Department or
                service generates revenue as the housing programme does through
                house sales. Underinvestment in many other services is often
                said to have occurred when the Government’s investment
                priority was, rightly, to invest in housing. Now that some of
                that investment is resulting in house sales and is generating
                revenue, it could be said that services which lost out before
                have a right to call on the additional revenue. The Executive
                will make those decisions in the light of prevailing pressures,
                patterns of need in housing and the needs of other Departments.</p>

                cut and bed blocking eradicated. Social funds must be freed to

                administration is due to commence in March or April 2002, but it
                has not been provided for in the Budget. The children’s

                provision in the Budget for that. I am concerned that there has

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member’s last two points were dealt
                with previously. I have said, on the record, that the cost of
                the review of public administration will be covered by an
                in-year monitoring bid rather than by the Budget. That does not
                mean that there is no pre-planning, rather that the Executive
                are not taxing the Budget plans with the cost of the review of
                public administration at this stage. If anything, the amount of
                money from the Budget that is wasted on such reviews would be
                remarked on. Therefore, we are making the call for the review of
                public administration in that way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similarly, I have dealt with the question
                about the children’s commissioner previously. I am getting
                repeat questions on some issues. I welcome the Member’s
                recognition of the fact that since devolution we have been able
                to increase significantly our spending on health.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The precise distribution of that is not a

                the Minister of Finance and Personnel, and the Minister of
                Agriculture and Rural Development, will take account of the
                Agriculture Committee’s views and that the vision group’s
                views will not overrule those of the Committee. The vision group
                is fine in its place, but it is employed by the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development to do a job. The members of
                the Agriculture Committee also have a job to do. The important
                aspect of that job is to ensure a viable agriculture industry in
                Northern Ireland. That must be the end result.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The vision group’s report is now under
                consultation. The Executive anticipate that they will give the
                group’s work further consideration in the future;
                consideration of resources will also feature in that. I
                understand why people criticise the Executive for trying to
                pre-empt the vision group’s recommendations by fixing an
                allocation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, what is happening with the Budget
                in the vision group is no different from what will happen with,
                for example, the Hayes review or the Burns report. Because
                consultation and consideration are still taking place, we cannot
                begin to specify what the resource implications of such reviews
                will be. When the Executive take decisions, Ministers usually
                reflect the views and priorities of the Committees, and the
                Executive as a whole try to pay attention to them. None of us
                can pledge that everything advocated by every Committee will
                form part of the outcome. We could not afford to do that
                financially, never mind in respect of administration or
                legislation.</p>

                cóiríocht, fostú foirne, forbairt suímh ghréasáin,
                feachtais feasachta, na conarthaí taighde a bronnadh agus
                fóram ar chúrsaí cothaithe. Cheadaigh an Chomhairle
                straitéis chorporáideach agus plean eatramhach an bhoird don
                bhliain 2001 agus thug dá haire an moladh go gceapfar plean

                Comhairle nuair a bheas sé réidh. Cheadaigh an Chomhairle an

                meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council that was held in
                sectoral format in Belfast on Friday 16 November. Issues
                relating to food safety and co-operation on health matters were
                considered at the meeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following nomination by the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister, junior Minister, Mr Nesbitt, and
                I attended the third meeting of the Council in the food safety
                and health sectors. Mr Micheál Martin, the Minister for Health
                and Children, and his departmental colleague Dr Thomas Moffatt,
                Minister of State with responsibility for food safety and older
                people, represented the Irish Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following statement was approved by Mr
                Dermot Nesbitt and is made on his behalf.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council received a progress report on the
                work of the Food Safety Promotion Board on issues covering the
                financial out-turn for 2000, accommodation, the employment of
                staff, development of the web site, awareness campaigns, the
                award of research contracts and a forum on nutrition. The
                Council approved the board’s corporate strategy and interim
                plan for 2001 and noted a proposal to develop a three-year,
                multi-annual plan, which will be submitted to the Council when
                complete. The Council approved the grading and remuneration of
                an initial tranche of 20 staff and noted proposals to assess the
                overall staffing needs in the context of the three-year plan.
                The legislation covering and governing the board provides for an
                advisory committee that will include scientific experts and
                representatives of broader food safety interests who will be
                appointed by the North/South Ministerial Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At its last meeting, the Council discussed
                the possible role and composition of the Food Safety Promotion
                Board’s advisory committee, which will provide scientific and
                technical advice to that body. The Council agreed that the
                committee should have a membership of 16, representing a wide
                variety of interests and disciplines, including the consumer and
                the food industry. The Council agreed the membership of the
                committee and that Prof Seán Strain should be its chairperson.
                It approved the board’s draft equality scheme and the New TSN
                action plan for public consultation. Finally, the Council
                accepted, in principle, the candidate who was recommended
                following a selection process for the post of chief executive to
                the Food Safety Promotion Board.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council received further reports on the
                progress made in implementing the programme of work that it had
                approved at the earlier meetings for each of the five areas
                identified as suitable for co-operation. Those areas are:
                accident and emergency services; planning for major emergencies;
                co-operation on high-technology equipment; cancer research; and
                health promotion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to accident and emergency
                services, the North/South Ministerial Council noted the proposal
                to expand the membership of the regional hospitals services
                group. The Council requested that the group consider the report
                of the group reviewing acute hospital services in the North. It
                also noted the proposal to identify additional service areas or
                specialities in which cross-border or all-island co-operation
                could be of mutual benefit to the respective services and would
                help patients.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The North/South Ministerial Council endorsed
                the work that had been done so far and the plans for further
                work on planning for major emergencies. The Council endorsed the
                membership of a joint health technology group and agreed a work
                programme for it. It noted the present co-operation on cancer
                research and, in particular, the launch of the all-Ireland
                cancer incidence report. The Council also noted that the two
                Health Departments were working together to develop a joint,
                strategically- planned health promotion programme and training
                resource.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The North/South Ministerial Council agreed
                that its next meeting in those sectoral formats would take place
                in the South in February 2002. The text of the communiqué that
                was issued following the meeting was agreed, and a copy has been

                fault of the staff. Elderly people with fractures of the neck or
                femur must wait five or six days for surgery. A patient with
                such a fracture should be operated on within 24 hours. Given

                Council received about accident and emergency services, what
                progress has been made on co-operation between Altnagelvin
                Hospital and Letterkenny General Hospital, between Sligo General
                Hospital and the Erne Hospital and between Daisy Hill Hospital

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the bilateral meeting that replaced the
                North/South Ministerial Council meeting that had been due to
                take place but did not, we heard a report from the co-operation
                and working together (CAWT) partners on the work done to date
                and the development of further work relating to the hospitals
                that Dr Hendron mentioned. The issue did not arise again in
                detail at the meeting on which I am reporting. The report at
                that meeting referred to the North/South regional hospital
                services group and the discussions that it has been involved in
                because of its members’ expertise in certain cross-border,
                specialised areas of service. The report also said that, at its
                next meeting, the group would review progress and set an agreed
                programme of work for next year. CAWT would have the opportunity
                to provide an update on its work.</p>

                weeks, we shall invite companies to submit tenders for the air
                ambulance feasibility study, with the aim of getting it under
                way by March 2002 and of having the completed report by May
                2002. That report will also examine possible locations for such

                question about the progress that has been made towards
                establishing an air ambulance service has already been answered.
                When the air ambulance service is set up, all areas should be
                investigated as a possible location, and the service should be
                centrally funded.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We shall examine the feasibility of providing
                such a service when we get the results of the study. ‘The
                Report of the Strategic Review of the Ambulance Service’
                concluded that the financial implications of running a dedicated
                air ambulance service were substantial and that, in the face of
                so many competing priorities, the service was unlikely to
                attract Government funding. The feasibility study being
                commissioned will provide an objective assessment of the costs
                and benefits of an air ambulance or helicopter emergency medical
                service to be run on an all-island basis and of whether we could
                provide such a service. The results of the feasibility study
                will inform future decisions on the profile of ambulance
                services.</p>

                recommendations of a North/South report into inequalities
                between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in respect
                of health? As a result of that report, does she intend to

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council did not discuss such details at
                its most recent meeting. We examined health promotion, and the
                issue of inequality arose in the context of nutrition during our
                discussion on the Food Safety Promotion Board. I am sure that at
                future meetings we shall re-examine the work of the all-island
                Institute of Public Health in Ireland. The institute was not set
                up specifically under the remit of the North/South Ministerial
                Council, but it is viewed in that context. I am sure that we
                shall advance the work of the institute, specifically its
                priorities in regard to health inequalities. That is a major
                point in the Executive’s Investing for Health strategy, which
                we are progressing.</p>

                services, I note that the Council is asking the regional
                hospital services group to consider the report of the Hayes
                review group in Northern Ireland. Does the Minister agree that
                the Hayes group should also consider developments in accident
                and emergency cover in Sligo and Cavan and the south-west area
                in general?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council endorsed the work so far and the
                plans for further work on planning for major emergencies. When
                we see major emergencies worldwide, we see the wide range of
                bodies that are brought in to assist — whether those be
                emergency services, military or policing services. Can the
                Minister inform us of the range of consultation involved in
                planning for major emergencies?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, Members will be aware that I had to
                put the Hayes report out for an initial period of consultation.
                Officials are looking at the substantial responses, and after
                consideration by Executive Colleagues of matters that arise, the
                proposals will go out for consultation. However, it was also
                clear that it was worthwhile for the regional hospital services
                group to look at the report also. Although not discussed at the
                meeting, I understand that the review group considered the
                potential for hospitals in the South to complement a new
                hospital in the south-west. I shall look carefully at that
                aspect of the group’s report along with views expressed during
                the initial consultation period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The meeting on 16 November looked at planning
                for major emergencies and noted the initiatives that are
                underway. A programme of cross-border emergency planning
                training courses to cover the medical response to a major
                incident is already in place. We are developing integrated
                communication protocols to activate hospital and community
                responses in a major emergency. Costing proposals are being
                drawn up for further work required for hospital and community
                emergency planning. Those proposals will include the development
                of comprehensive resource mapping analysis for the trusts and
                health boards along the border, joint planning for cross-border
                live exercises and the development of a language register, which
                is a list of interpreters available to attend at emergencies.
                They will also include the work being done by the Department of
                Culture, Arts and Leisure, which is taking the lead on the
                matter of interpreters and language.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are developing an agreed template and
                glossary of terms for major emergency plans, proposals for the
                introduction of first responder schemes and an evaluation of the
                helicopter emergency medical service. We talked about the
                development of a road traffic accident response strategy for
                fire brigades in border areas and looked at proposals for, and
                the cost of, piloting fire safety awareness education in schools
                in all border area education authorities.</p>

                wonderful ideas in the Minister’s statement and the progress
                that has been made, I just wonder if at some stage we could get
                down to practical matters that would make a difference to
                ordinary people’s lives. There are a couple of things that I
                would like to see done.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will it soon be possible to have mutual
                recognition of medical licensing, North and South? Medical
                people register with separate bodies; although movement between
                North and South is possible, it is not easy, and they need to
                reregister. I wish to see registrars and senior registrars who
                work in Dublin being able to work in Belfast and vice versa,
                because that would be of mutual benefit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People in Donegal should be able to avail
                themselves of services at Altnagelvin Hospital, and cancer
                patients from Donegal should be able to access the world-class
                services at the Belfast City Hospital. My colleagues in Donegal
                have expressed interest, but the bureaucracy is extremely
                complicated. They would also like to have some funding mechanism
                that accompanies patients so that they can avail themselves of
                services in the North. However, that question needs to be
                addressed in the South.</p>

                joint training, staff development and exchange opportunities in
                radiotherapy services, for example. We also noted the proposal
                to identify additional service areas and specialities for which
                cross-border or all-island co-operation could be of mutual
                benefit to patients, and any suggestions are welcome.</p>

                The Council noted that the two Health Departments are working
                together to develop a joint strategy on health promotion and
                training resources. What are the proposals and when will they be

                full outline of the proposals until a later date.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted at its meeting on 16
                November that the folic acid campaign, which was jointly
                launched, has been very successful, especially in the North. The
                jointly launched physical activity campaign, which ran from May
                to June and again in the early autumn, has also just finished.
                There is collaboration on smoking. We are considering an
                all-Ireland healthy eating circle award scheme, which could
                include people’s homes as well as specific catering
                establishments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted concern about the suicide
                leaflet, which was originally developed here, but which the
                Irish Association of Suicidology agreed should be launched on an
                all-island basis. Mr Martin, the Irish Health Minister, and I
                jointly launched the leaflet on 10 October 2001, which was World
                Mental Health Day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have been able to work together in those
                areas, and we hope to develop strategically in the future. The
                Department of Health and Children has nominated a
                representative, Mr Kevin Devine, to sit on our working group on
                tobacco, which is developing an action plan to tackle smoking.
                There is a considerable amount of work at present, and the
                Departments will meet in the next month to discuss opportunities
                for all-Ireland research into public health. Officials will meet
                in the new year to advance the development of the programme that

                that she is now able to carry out that crucial area of work
                after her exile from the North/ South Ministerial Council. I
                also welcome the present co-operation on cancer research,
                particularly in the light of the high rate of cancer in my
                constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone. How does the

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We shall develop the issue of cancer research
                in the context of the tripartite arrangement, and particularly
                in the context of the memorandum of understanding. That
                memorandum was launched following its signing in October 1999 by
                the National Cancer Institute in the United States, the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in the
                North and the Department of Health and Children in the South.
                The memorandum was a result of detailed consultation between the
                various Administrations and recognised that cancer is a major
                public health and healthcare problem causing premature morbidity
                and mortality in all three jurisdictions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consortium will, in the first instance,
                exist for five years. The type of work that we shall undertake
                will be in that context — for example, we are making progress
                toward the development of an all-Ireland clinical trials
                network. It is important to have access to that, as clinical
                trials become the global standard for effective cancer
                prevention and care. We have an ongoing successful scholar
                exchange programme, which commenced during 2000, to help develop
                a core of well-trained cancer research specialists. In addition,
                a number of epidemiology fellowships have been established,
                which will continue to develop.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Through the consortium, the informatics
                infrastructure in both parts of the island is being enhanced to
                support co-ordinated clinical trials between hospitals and
                cancer centres. A valuable tool in that exercise is the
                introduction of telesynergy. I was delighted during the summer
                to announce funding totalling £150,000 for the Belfast City
                Hospital arm of that resource. That is the way in which we are
                trying to move forward following the Campbell report. At the
                meeting of 16 November, the Council endorsed the steps to date:
                the development of the hospitals infrastructure; the conducting
                of high-quality cancer clinical trials; the planned developments
                to co-ordinate all-Ireland clinical trial activity; the
                development of the telesynergy communications link structure;
                and the scholar exchange programme. That programme has already
                been established, and, as I have already said, we hope to extend
                it.</p>

                commissioned a policy review of the social economy, which was
                completed by Colin Stutt Associates in June 2001. The Executive
                agreed to the process recommendations, which are being carried

                during 2000-01, and there were no visits by potential investors.
                It is important to point out that the IDB has six client
                companies in the borough of Larne, employing almost 1,800
                people. Four of those companies are currently undertaking
                investment supported by the IDB. That is a clear indication that
                the IDB is active in promoting future investment in the Larne
                area.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister acknowledge that
                unemployment is a problem in the east of the Province, in areas
                such as Larne, and that it does not occur only in the west? Does
                he accept that although unemployment in the borough of Larne has
                declined in the last decade, the increase in unemployment there
                in the past year has been greater than that of any other borough
                in Northern Ireland? There has been a 6·3% increase in
                unemployment in Larne borough, by comparison with an average
                decrease of 6·5% in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister believe that increased
                focus from Invest Northern Ireland will have to be directed at

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment, which collates and publishes unemployment figures,
                is fully aware of the situation in each of the 18 constituencies
                and in every district council area. It monitors the situation
                constantly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department is anxious to promote and, in
                doing so, to support indigenous investment. The Department and
                the Executive recognise that we must ensure that our indigenous
                entrepreneurs are given all possible encouragement and financial
                support. Given that the downturn in overseas investment in
                Northern Ireland is affected by the general global situation, we
                might find that it is to our indigenous investors that we will
                turn most often. However, the question of where investment is
                made is one of balance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Overseas investors will always be welcome,
                and we must continue to try to attract them. However, we must
                also provide indigenous investors with the support that I have
                outlined. There is a need to attend to the areas where
                unemployment is greatest. The Member will see from the activity
                of the Government and in the Programme for Government a clear
                reflection of the Executive’s concern to do just that.</p>

                out the above-market costs of the industry by means of a
                long-term bond of costs, which could be met by consumers.
                However, much work is required before definitive conclusions can

                station, can the Minister tell us what actions are being taken

                the medium and long terms have led to the decision to withdraw.

                It is a voluntary code that sets the standard for non-ageist
                approaches to employment. The code covers good practice in six
                aspects of the employment cycle: recruitment; selection;
                promotion; training; redundancy; and retirement. I agree in

                nature of that balance must reflect the skills needs of a
                particular enterprise. Therefore, we must allow employers to

                be sought to cover the increasing costs of maintaining those on
                employment support in the future. The available funds will not
                allow a significant expansion of the scheme, but it is important
                to note that applications are being accepted. I trust that the

                projects in Dungannon West. In 1996, under the community
                economic regeneration scheme, the Department co-funded with the
                International Fund for Ireland a business complex at
                Ballysaggart costing £700,000. In 1998, under the special
                support programme for peace and reconciliation, the Department
                supported the provision of nursery school and community
                facilities at Ballygawley Road at a cost of approximately

                for Dungannon, including the area known as Dungannon West, has
                been drawn up by consultants employed by the Dungannon
                regeneration partnership. This group, which is supported by the
                council, has just received the final draft report from the
                consultants. When the strategy is adopted, my officials will

                as have taken place in Banbridge. The Member will be aware that

                religious composition of the Northern Ireland Civil Service at

                individual departments, in respect of community background and

                provides a comprehensive package of insulation measures for
                vulnerable private sector householders in receipt of an income-
                or disability-based benefit. The programme includes improvements
                in insulation and heating standards for private householders
                over 60 years of age on income-based benefits. EAGA Partnership
                was appointed as scheme manager, and the physical installation

                Dungannon, which suffer severe social and economic deprivation.
                One such scheme is nearing completion in Beechmount, west
                Belfast, and similar schemes in Foyle and Willowfield in east
                Belfast have begun.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the warm homes scheme, which

                include: new build social housing programmes with 1,200
                dwellings this year; £42 million in private sector grants
                allocated this year; the Northern Ireland Housing Executive
                heating policy, with over 700 new or converted systems this
                year; and winter fuel payments amounting to £200 annually to

                will be 600 deaths attributable to cold- related illnesses this
                winter. Can the Minister outline how many of these deaths will
                be prevented by the new domestic energy efficiency scheme?</p>

                that energy efficiency measures will not assist those on low
                incomes to purchase oil and winter fuels? Does he envisage any
                means whereby funding can be provided for those who do not
                benefit from energy efficiency to enable them to have the fuel

                result of fuel poverty in Northern Ireland. It is a very serious
                issue. Therefore, although my Department is spending £4·38
                million in the first year, with almost £8 million targeted next
                year for the warm homes scheme, it wants to spend more on this
                and reach more homes to deal with the issues that the Member has
                highlighted. I am somewhat disappointed at the refusal of the
                Department of Finance and Personnel to make this a greater
                priority. Nevertheless, I will continue to strive carefully and

                safety is compromised and the risk of fire is increased. Will

                The second category covers works done outside tenants’ homes,
                including marking steps clearly and providing additional
                external lighting and handrails. The third scheme is designed to
                improve tenants’ sense of security in their homes through
                preventative measures such as designing areas for safe living
                and the use of neighbourhood wardens.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Saturday night, an elderly person was
                assaulted in her home in my constituency, the fifth such
                incident. The Minister should consider the provision of locks
                for people’s homes. Will he consider a scheme to provide a
                monitor or some sort of small CCTV camera on the front door of
                elderly people’s homes so that they do not have to answer the
                door in the first place? That would reduce the chances of
                someone forcing entry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department should develop an inter-agency
                approach to the care and protection of elderly people, along
                with the trusts, the police and charitable organisations?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I share the Member’s concern about attacks
                on elderly residents. It is deplorable that so many of our most
                vulnerable citizens suffer attacks in their own home. For many,
                such attacks have an extremely traumatic effect. The attacks are
                despicable, and I am sure that all Members will join the Member
                and me in deploring them. Unfortunately, the incidence of such
                behaviour seems to be increasing and spreading across all areas.
                I take on board the points that the Member has made and would be
                happy to discuss them with her in detail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In June, the Housing Executive approved a
                three-year strategic plan, which will help to develop
                initiatives to deal with community safety. That commits the
                Housing Executive to working with other agencies and landlords,
                including the Community Relations Council, the Northern Ireland
                Office, the Community Safety Centre, Groundwork Northern
                Ireland, the Northern Ireland Voluntary Trust and my Department’s
                urban regeneration and community development group.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Housing Executive has implemented the
                anti- social behaviour unit, neighbourhood wardens, the 10
                estates crime reduction initiative, inter-agency training, the
                greencare programme and the mediation development group. It will
                carry forward its three-year plan, which it will monitor and
                evaluate. I take on board the Member’s points, because they
                are matters of vital concern.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the past two years, the Housing
                Executive, which has a statutory duty to deal with homelessness,
                has continued to provide a programme of permanent housing,
                temporary accommodation, advice, assistance and support. That
                support includes funding the voluntary sector to deliver a range
                of services, such as accommodation and preventative measures.
                Most recently the Housing Executive has funded research into
                young people leaving care, disability and homelessness and
                homelessness and families. An educational package called ‘Housemate’,
                published by the charity Shelter, provides homelessness advice
                in the school curriculum. Other initiatives include the Simon
                Community’s peer education and outhouse projects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 24 September, the Housing Executive
                launched a review of its homelessness strategy and services.
                Statutory and voluntary agencies that work in housing have been
                consulted, as have probation, health and social services and
                community groups. The consultation finishes on 31 December. The
                review will be finalised in March 2002, and an implementation
                plan will be produced to progress work on the various
                recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Housing Executive spends some
                £11·5 million per annum on homelessness services, including
                administration costs.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that the figure of
                over 2,000 homeless people in Northern Ireland represents a
                social problem of mounting importance, especially as the problem
                can often be linked to a subculture of drugs, petty crime and,
                as we suspect in one case, murder? What has he done to liaise
                with law enforcement agencies to help to eradicate the problem
                before it worsens?</p>
                <b>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Essentially, homelessness is a social
                problem. I accept the Member’s comment on the related issues
                of law and order and policing. As I said in my initial answer,
                my Department and the Housing Executive are examining a broad
                range of measures to tackle the problem. The seriousness of the
                issue and the concern that we deal with homelessness were the
                motivations behind the launch by the Executive of a review of
                its homelessness strategy and services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Envisaged in the review are considerable
                joint working and inter-agency planning. The intention is to
                improve the service to the homeless in Northern Ireland. The
                recommendations of the review will have resource implications,
                and the House will have to address those. I am sure that the
                Member will want to express his views in the consultation
                process, and the Housing Executive will be glad to hear his
                views on law and order.</p>

                Despite the measures that the Minister has outlined, and the

                people who are registered as homeless has increased in the past
                couple of years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the review of the Executive’s
                homelessness strategy set a target for a reduction in the number
                of homeless people? What further measures does the Minister

                proposes the development of various support packages to prevent
                homelessness and to assist in resettlement and tenancy support.
                All Members have received a copy of that report. I urge all

                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall make a statement on behalf of the
                Executive on the second set of allocations from the Executive
                programme funds. The allocations come from three of the five
                funds and are summarised in the table attached to the copies of
                the statement that have been given to Members. The details are
                also included in the Budget document that was presented to the
                Assembly today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly will recall that our aim in
                establishing the Executive programme funds was to assist the
                development of new policies and programmes and to improve public
                services in accordance with the priorities that were identified
                in the first Programme for Government. We also set up the funds
                to help us to break away from the patterns of spending that
                applied under direct rule, so that local solutions could be
                applied to local problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are five Executive programme funds: the
                social inclusion and community regeneration fund; the new
                directions fund; the infrastructure and capital renewal fund;
                the service modernisation fund; and the children’s fund. In
                total, more than £370 million has been made available for the
                five funds in the three years from 2001-02 to 2003-04.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive decided to have two rounds of
                allocations this year to allow time for experience to be gained
                in the operation of the funds and to avoid committing all the
                available resources in the first round of allocations. It was
                our intention that there should simply be one allocation round
                each year, after this first year of operation. In the case of
                the infrastructure and capital renewal fund, it was necessary to
                commit resources in good time earlier this year to permit
                investment to proceed in 2001-02. Hence, the Executive decided
                at the outset not to make any further allocations from that
                fund, even in this first year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive are making no allocations from
                the children’s fund now, as we have agreed to consult widely
                on the arrangements for involving the community and voluntary
                sectors in that fund operation. Further allocations will be made
                next year, when we have considered the results of the
                consultation, which closes on 11 January 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purposes of the funds have been set out
                fully in the Programme for Government and Budget documents.
                Details of the criteria that we adopted to guide bidding and
                selection process have also been issued to Assembly Committees.
                Bids were sought in July, with a deadline of 24 September. Clear
                guidelines were issued to Departments on the principles
                underlying the funds, including the general criteria applicable
                to bids for any fund and the more specific criteria for each
                fund.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Departments lodged 89 bids across the three
                funds, totalling almost £144 million over three years. All bids
                have been scrutinised carefully against the criteria to receive
                funds by the Department of Finance and Personnel, the Economic
                Policy Unit and the Equality Unit, working closely with all
                Departments. Among other things, an assessment was made as to
                whether the proposals were consistent with the principles of New
                TSN and the statutory equality duty imposed by section 75 of the
                Northern Ireland Act 1998. The Executive have been able to draw
                on that analysis in considering all the bids.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the second tranche of allocations in the
                2001-02 financial year, the Executive have decided that 31
                proposals, amounting to slightly more than £39 million over
                three years, should be supported from the three funds. That
                figure includes the extra £1·4 million made available to the
                social inclusion fund from the revised Budget announced earlier
                today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rather than go into detail on every project I
                shall concentrate on how those allocations will support the
                priorities collectively agreed by the Executive. The
                establishment of the new directions fund signalled the Executive’s
                determination to promote new and innovative ways to develop and
                deliver public services. We received 31 bids and propose support
                for 12. Those funds amount to £16·7 million over the three
                years 2001-02 to 2003-04.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The allocations announced today will provide
                innovative and modern technology for the Fire Service and the
                Ambulance Service. The digital trunk radio system will enable an
                integrated response to emergencies and facilitate closer
                co-operation between the police, fire, ambulance and coastguard
                services. It should also lead to a more equitable provision of
                emergency services in rural areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New technology will also be provided in the
                Health Service to promote interdependence among vulnerable
                groups through the Department of Health, Social Service and
                Public Safety’s and the Department for Social Development’s
                joint venture, Getting Home Staying Home. Hospital appointment
                booking will be improved by better information and communication
                technology (ICT) equipment, and better sharing of data among
                different professional groups will enable care professionals to
                deliver services more efficiently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The survival rate of victims of head injuries
                should be significantly enhanced by provision of funding for the
                acquired brain injury unit, while an allocation for the
                community psychological service should reduce referrals to
                primary and secondary care services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We shall invest in education in several ways.
                The purchase of recently developed equipment will improve
                support for children with severe learning and physical
                difficulties, enabling many to communicate, often for the first
                time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The employers for children scheme provides a
                bridge between employers and employees. It funds a range of
                innovative childcare solutions to enable more parents,
                especially women, to take up, and stay in, jobs. The funding
                announced today will provide the 35% required to match the
                European building for sustainable prosperity (BSP) contribution
                to this scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Funding will be provided for the Department
                for Employment and Learning to introduce a rapid advancement
                programme in electronic engineering, which will be targeted at
                unemployed graduates.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The emerging soccer strategy is currently the
                subject of public consultation, and we shall provide support for
                that. The strategic proposals put forward by the Department of
                Culture, Arts and Leisure seek to provide an infrastructure for
                soccer development. On completion of the current consultation
                exercise early in 2002, funding commitments must be further
                assessed in the light of the draft strategy and accompanying
                business plan.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In respect of the service modernisation fund,
                we have sought to find the means to promote efficiency and
                innovation in the delivery of public sector services. Our focus
                has been on how to make a difference in the management and
                delivery of services for the ultimate benefit of the public. A
                total of 27 bids for the fund were presented by nine
                Departments, and it is proposed that seven should be supported
                in that tranche at a cost of £7 million over three years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development of e-government was a major
                theme supported in the first tranche of this year’s funding.
                The five proposals supported in that tranche should further
                enhance its progress. The bid by the Department of Culture,
                Arts, and Leisure to provide for the integration of information
                management across public services will meet the requirements of
                freedom of information and will provide the public with
                electronic access to records held in the Public Record Office.
                The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment will also
                advance the theme through its project for the electronic
                management of document records.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The modernisation of health services is a
                major feature of the recommended bids. The electronic management
                of materials in the Health Service will free up both finance and
                staff time for the provision of services to the public. The
                dedicated medicines risk management function in six major
                hospitals should become self-financing. That will provide better
                and safer services for patients.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two further allocations will lead to
                significant improvements in the Health Service. The introduction
                of a team of &quot;rapid responders&quot; in each health board
                area will significantly enhance services to the public by
                reducing ambulance response times in rural areas. The purchase
                of one replacement and one additional MRI scanner will also
                enhance services by reducing waiting times and providing a
                consequential reduction in the number of operations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We provided support for the electronic
                libraries private finance initiative (PFI) project in the first
                round of the fund, and, as we indicated then, we now seek to
                build on that initiative and significantly improve the service
                that school libraries can provide.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of the fund for social inclusion
                and community regeneration is to support actions against poverty
                and the development of effective community measures in urban and
                rural settings, as well as to support actions on community
                relations and for cultural diversity. Some 12 of the 31 bids
                submitted will be supported. Of those, three allocations will
                tackle different forms of disadvantage and exclusion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are allocating funds to the Department of
                Education to match funding provided by the Department of
                Education and Science in the South to build a centre of
                excellence for action on autism. That project will provide a
                unique and innovative centre to assist those with severe
                autistic disorders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Funding is being provided to support
                cross-cutting outreach work, involving health trusts, youth and
                community groups, the police and the Probation Board for
                Northern Ireland. The programme has a proven track record in the
                Shankill and in other parts of west Belfast. The Executive’s
                assistance will enable the scheme to continue to be extended to
                north and east Belfast. Subject to further evaluation, we may
                consider extending the programme to south Belfast and other
                areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are also providing some support to extend
                the successful Making a Good Start scheme from primary one to
                primary two in those schools with the lowest performance
                figures. That will provide funds to recruit additional classroom
                assistants in those areas with greatest need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several measures are proposed to promote
                equality at different levels in society. The provision of match
                funding for the Department for Employment and Learning’s EQUAL
                programme will test new ways of combating inequalities in the
                labour market.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Support for the cross-departmental Investing
                for Health group will help to establish four investing for
                health partnerships with the goal of reducing health
                inequalities. Support will also be provided to develop better
                language translation services, so that ethnic minorities may
                find it easier to use the Health Service. That scheme offers the
                potential to meet wider needs across public services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the auspices of the Department for
                Social Development, the outer north integrated development
                operation in Derry will advance the pilot project — funded by
                the first tranche of Executive programme funds — and take
                account of the experience gained. Elsewhere, through the
                development of an outreach strategy, the programme will target
                those communities that are most in need. By making full use of
                existing skills and information in the public and voluntary
                sectors, it has the potential to minimise consultancy costs. The
                programme will be enhanced by the provision of timely and
                consistent statistics at neighbourhood level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are providing resources for the creation
                of a victims’ fund to support the forthcoming
                cross-departmental victims strategy. The fund will be orientated
                at encouraging the development of partnerships.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After two rounds of bids, the Executive have
                agreed that it would be timely to reflect on the way that the
                funds have operated so far. The funds have the potential to
                provide one of the most effective ways of promoting
                cross-cutting work and supporting initiatives introduced by
                groups of Ministers working together. However, we must be sure
                that the resources that we have set aside are being directed
                effectively towards the objectives that we hope to achieve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first round of allocations is already
                making a significant impact, and that will be enhanced by the
                allocations announced today. However, we have concluded that it
                would be sensible to take stock and complete a short review of
                the arrangements before we make any further allocations. That
                will ensure that we deliver on our priorities and commitments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In that context, we have looked carefully at
                the Committee for Finance and Personnel’s constructive report
                on the Executive programme funds, which Members will have read.
                The Committee provided a useful commentary on the funds and
                offered some positive proposals for improvement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Informed by the report, the Executive have
                agreed to undertake a review that seeks to improve on current
                arrangements. We shall consider improvements such as a more
                top-down approach, which may give more direction to the
                development of future allocations. That could be done through
                the establishment of ministerial subcommittees or by other
                means. We may also wish to review of the number of funds and
                their remits. There may be scope to merge two or more funds. The
                Executive wish to set out the strategic direction and intent of
                each fund as clearly as possible. We may need to place a greater
                emphasis on ensuring that bids are made with clear Executive and
                departmental priorities in mind. The funds were designed around
                Executive priorities and are not for luxuries. We also want to
                streamline procedures to reduce bureaucracy and speed up the
                allocation process. The Committee for Finance and Personnel made
                particularly pertinent points in relation to that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to improving procedures in
                Departments and the Executive, we shall be giving further
                consideration to the role of departmental Committees and
                responding substantively to the proposals from the Committee for
                Finance and Personnel. We have agreed to consult the Committee
                further on that and take its views into account before making
                any decisions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive set out to make a difference
                through the creation of the Executive programme funds. The
                allocations that we announce today are further evidence that we
                are beginning to work in new and distinctive ways. We have been
                able to address needs in a range of services and provide support
                for the development of improvements, especially in the Health
                Service. There is widespread support for that. It is important
                to maximise the opportunities provided by the funds and to make
                the most of the resources that we have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall discuss the proposals that I have
                announced today with the Committee for Finance and Personnel. In
                particular, the Executive shall consult that Committee on the
                review that we are undertaking.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the proposals to the Assembly on
                behalf of the Executive.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. I welcome the additional
                allocations and the decision to conduct a review of how the
                funds are operating. Have the Executive programme funds been
                unsuccessful because cross-cutting measures have not been
                introduced and because they have failed to generate innovative
                ideas? What evaluation process has been built into the
                allocation process to determine any positive impact that the
                funds are having?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The funds have been successful as a means of
                driving a wedge into our spending patterns. They have enabled us
                to move away from the patterns that we inherited and to create
                new ones.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to improve aspects of the Executive
                programme funds, and that was positively and constructively
                reflected by the Committee for Finance and Personnel. We want to
                encourage more cross-cutting, interdepartmental bids and
                proposals than we have had to date, and one way to achieve that
                could be through the use of Executive subcommittees that could,
                in turn, stimulate much more interdepartmental planning and
                collaboration in raising proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, although there may not have been as
                many cross-cutting proposals as we would have liked, many of the
                measures being proposed by Departments not only have an impact
                on their own departmental programmes but offer consequential
                benefits to other programme areas. In future, we want to ensure
                that we maximise the benefits from Executive programme fund
                allocations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the context of the review work that we are
                undertaking, we shall try to establish what more can be done to
                ensure that we benefit fully from better evaluation of any
                measures that are funded. Given that some of the projects that
                we have funded in advance have been pilot projects, good
                evaluation will be a key element. In today’s announcement, we
                can already see how further allocations, such as the outer north
                integrated development operation allocation to Derry through the
                Department for Social Development, follow through on earlier
                pilot schemes that received funding in a previous round. Again,
                that shows the importance of good evaluation on good pilot
                schemes.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like the Chairperson of the Committee for
                Finance and Personnel, I welcome the programme that has been set
                out. I agree with his remarks about what has been said in
                Committee. The Minister is aware of our belief that a genuine
                cross-cutting element should be developed as the use of those
                funds develops.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I wish to express my disappointment
                at one of the allocations. Paragraph 25 notes the introduction
                of a digital trunk radio system. I welcome that, but there is
                concern about the need for digital hearing aids in the Health
                Service. I wonder how the Health Service can be awarded support
                for one digital technology, while at that same time being denied
                finance for another digital technology essential to the service
                that it provides.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s statement mentions equity,
                New TSN, service modernisation, and innovative and modern
                technology. I urge him to tell me whether he will be able to
                advise his successor that that matter must be considered in the
                near future — be it as part of the Executive programme funds
                or in a future monitoring round.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the amounts of money that we allocate,
                we clearly cannot meet all the bids. The Member has identified
                one bid that, at this stage, we have not met. Obviously,
                Departments are not precluded from re-examining their own
                prioritisation when providing services to those people who would
                have benefited from the equipment that was bid for on this
                occasion. We cannot be made to feel obliged to meet all digital
                bids simply because we have made provision for one form of
                digital equipment in response to one bid.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We simply could not make allocations on that
                basis. I am confident that the bid we have met for the fire and
                ambulance services will help to improve services to many people,
                especially in rural areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not possible to meet all of the bids at
                present. I cannot argue against the bid to fund the
                modernisation of audiology services. That would provide a
                worthwhile service, and I am sure that the Executive will want
                to look at that in the future. I am also sure that the
                Department will want to examine that as well. However, if the
                service is as essential as everybody says, the question is
                whether it should be an Executive programme funds bid anyway?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We get the cyclical argument from people that
                there should be cross-cutting bids — and then the bids they
                identify come from a particular Department. I have no problem
                with looking at any bid in the context of Executive programme
                funds allocations.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Health,

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement,
                particularly the innovative and modern technology proposed under
                the new directions fund for the fire and ambulance services,
                which will lead to a more equitable provision of emergency
                services in rural areas. The same applies to intensive care
                treatment in hospitals. The Minister mentioned head injury
                survival rates, and rapid response units in each health board,
                which will help the ambulance service to help people in remote
                areas. Those services are extremely important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In paragraph 35 of his statement, the
                Minister mentions the purchase of one replacement and one
                additional MRI scanner — that is magnificent news. I
                understand that the replacement scanner is for the Royal
                Victoria Hospital, and many people from across the Province who
                attend that hospital will welcome that. I understand that the
                new scanner is for the Belfast City Hospital, which is where the
                new cancer unit is to be. I am sure that the Minister will join
                me in congratulating the Friends of Montgomery House — the old
                Belvoir Park Hospital — because Mrs Christine Lynch informed
                me on Friday evening that they have now acquired funding, over
                time, for a new MRI scanner for Belvoir Park Hospital. That,
                together with the Minister’s announcement of a new scanner for
                the Belfast City Hospital and a replacement scanner for the
                Royal Victoria Hospital, is a major step forward for cancer
                services. I am sure that the Minister will agree.</p>

                taken, particularly on cancer services and the implementation of
                the regional cancer strategy. The Chairperson has a dedicated
                interest in that area, and I welcome the fact that, on behalf of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the important contribution that
                scanners provide, especially in cancer services. I hope that the
                fact that we are able to replace a scanner, and fund a new one,
                will go some way to making good some of the pressures that we
                have identified. We hope that that will help reduce waiting
                times, times of worry for patients and the number of operations.
                No matter where such scanners are located, they make a
                significant contribution, not only to patient care, but to
                hospital performance.</p>

                expressed concern regarding the Planning Service’s capacity to
                cope with the current levels of economic activity. The bid has,
                however, been unsuccessful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is also disappointed that the
                new directions fund bid to establish and resource a Northern
                Ireland coastal forum has not been successful, especially as the
                proposal received widespread support in the Assembly and from
                the Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is disappointed that the
                Department of the Environment’s bid to promote sustainable
                development was not approved. I cannot understand why such a
                practical, innovative bid, which would help all Departments to
                integrate social and environmental objectives for the
                development of the Northern Ireland economy in a sustainable
                way, has not been met. The Department of the Environment’s
                bids do not feature at all in today’s list of Executive
                programme funds. Since April, only the road safety bid has been
                successful. Surely that is unacceptable treatment of the
                Department of the Environment. Can the Minister inform the
                Committee how those matters will be taken forward?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Members that these announcements are
                taking place against the backdrop of this morning’s Budget
                announcement, which includes an increase of 10% for next year in
                the budget for the Department of the Environment. That follows a
                high increase in this year’s budget, so over two years there
                is a 25% increase in the Department of the Environment’s
                budget. That provision includes increased allocations aimed
                specifically at making good many of the identified pressures in
                the Planning Service. In the context of possibly re-examining
                some of the criticisms and questions that have been raised about
                the Executive programme funds — how far they are meeting new
                and distinctive needs and how far they are meeting cross-cutting
                needs — people may wish to look at the points raised by the
                Member.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the Planning Service, some issues arose in
                relation to the costings that were provided and whether they
                were containable. Given that the bid appeared to relate to
                policy and strategy issues, it was felt that it should be seen
                more as part of normal departmental work. Also, the bid was not
                supported by a business case. I make the point again, however,
                that the Planning Service is benefiting from a 25% increase in
                funding. I hope, therefore, that it can find ways of addressing
                the issues that were identified in the context of the modern
                office bid.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the coastal forum, it has not yet been
                possible to establish any quantification of outcomes, so no
                allocation has been made at this stage. That does not mean that
                consideration in future bidding rounds might not be appropriate
                once the results of the scoping exercise currently being
                undertaken by the Department are known. I point Members to the
                report by the Committee for Finance and Personnel. It clearly
                states that we should not allocate moneys from the Executive
                programme funds on a speculative basis. There must be a clear
                case, and clear expectations as to outcomes, when we make
                allocations.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement and his
                attempt — which was not totally fruitless — to throw some
                light on what is increasingly being perceived as a rather grey
                area of public expenditure. Is he really satisfied that
                Executive programme funds are achieving the purposes for which
                they were established? He has made references to the need for
                cross-cutting. However, there is a large cloud of confusion
                surrounding these funds. Does he not agree that to have
                Departments operating on allocations of Executive programme
                funds while simultaneously dealing with budget allocations and
                monitoring rounds only adds to the confusion?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It also adds to the bureaucracy surrounding
                the implementation of these funds and thus clouds their purpose
                and intent. It diminishes any possibility for proper
                accountability and transparency. Does he not further agree that
                in dealing with Executive programme funds, to spread the butter
                too thinly leads to a rather tasteless and bland sandwich?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close has raised a number of points.
                First, I do not accept that the Executive programme funds are a
                rather grey area of public expenditure: they are one of the most
                transparent areas. They receive a degree of scrutiny and
                declaration. Executive programme funds decisions are fully
                discussed and agreed by the Executive and are, in turn, fully
                communicated and scrutinised in the Chamber. Executive programme
                funds represent a fraction of the Budget. Considering the
                allocations that go out through Departments — all of the
                precise and particular allocations made by Departments, which
                are not the subject of announcements or scrutiny in the Chamber
                — I do not accept the premise that Executive programme funds,
                which are washed through with more scrutiny than any other area
                of public expenditure, are a grey area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive programme funds can be
                improved. I have already reflected that the Executive recognise
                that, and I have expressed appreciation for some of the points
                and suggestions that have come from the Committee for Finance
                and Personnel to that end. We want to improve things.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This year, the first year of Executive
                programme funds, we said that we would have two allocation
                rounds simply so that we could learn from the first and try to
                improve in the second. We would see what lessons could be learnt
                from both allocations and try to make improvements. In future
                there will be only one tranche per year from the Executive
                programme funds. The plan is to try to take them at a time when
                they are distinct from the Budget, although the allocations will
                have to be reflected properly in any Budget statements that come
                forward. Those plans are afoot.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the start, many people asked whether we
                needed Executive programme funds and questioned their value.
                People are now asking how we can improve the funds and make them
                work more effectively and meaningfully. That is the right
                question for us to ask. We have work to do in that regard.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for
                Employment and Learning (Dr Birnie):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister in his previous replies has
                partially addressed my concern about the lack of a significant
                number of multidepartmental activities in the current round of
                Executive programme funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have two questions relating to the
                Department for Employment and Learning. First, when did the
                Minister receive the Department’s bid relating to the rapid
                advancement programme? I ask that because this particular
                outcome has come as a surprise to my Committee since the bids
                detailed to us by the Department as recently as September made
                no mention of the rapid advance programme bid.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, does the Minister agree that the
                problems surrounding adult basic skills are still such a
                fundamental social and economic problem that they deserve
                further Executive programme funding? I recognise and welcome
                what they received in the first round — albeit a small amount.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anything that helps to improve adult basic
                skills is worthy of funding — by whatever means we can afford
                it, whether it is through standard Budget rounds or Executive
                programme funds. Improvements in that area involve the work of
                more than just the Department for Employment and Learning and
                will have benefits that extend to programmes and services
                outside that Department. However, that area will continue to be
                an eligible candidate for support from the Executive programme
                funds. I will get back to the Member on the precise date for
                receipt of applications, and he might also check with the
                Department for Employment and Learning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New issues emerge in these rounds, and even
                though there are clear deadlines and cut-off dates,
                consequential developments emerge. While not running a loose
                regime, we have to be alert and adept in addressing other points
                that emerge. I hope that that clarifies matters with regard to
                the calendar of bids.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the statement and the additional
                resources in the Executive programme funds. I particularly
                welcome the provision of funding for the acquired brain injury

                management function in six major hospitals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the resources being made
                available to the Department of Education to extend the Making a
                Good Start scheme for primary two children. Will the Minister
                confirm that investing in children is consistent with the
                principles of building for the future and also consistent with
                his actions in caring for the children in Holy Cross Girls’
                Primary School in north Belfast?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate Mrs Courtney’s welcome for the
                measures supported by these allocations, not least those in the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, in
                which she has a particular interest. I also welcome her support
                for the allocation to extend the Making a Good Start scheme. The
                Minister of Education and his Department attach a great deal of
                importance to this programme. The Executive have agreed that
                supporting children in schools at that young age —
                particularly in areas of greatest need — and trying to make a
                difference to the educational achievements and outcomes that
                they can expect is a worthwhile investment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was encouraging to note in the Minister’s
                statement this morning an increase of 14·8% in the budget for
                the Department for Regional Development. However, a massive gap
                remains in the Department’s funding if it is to address the
                infrastructure maintenance backlog. Perhaps the only way this
                can be tackled is by identifying other methods of funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is disappointing to note that the
                Department for Regional Development was not successful in its
                bid to set up a central unit to examine alternative methods of
                funding. Does the Minister agree that this small amount of
                funding would have been money well spent, given the potential
                revenue it could generate? If further funds become available in
                the future, can the Department for Regional Development’s bid
                be given sympathetic consideration?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive have allocated money to try to
                ensure that they can do more to maximise the potential for
                public-private partnerships and to make sure that they make the
                most of whatever alternative sources of funding may be
                available. They have also established a working group on
                public-private partnerships on behalf of the Executive, and that
                involves representatives of different Departments, including the
                Department for Regional Development.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Its aim is to establish an overall framework
                for our approach to the issue. Depending on the outcome of that
                approach, it is possible that further departmental measures
                might be supported through Executive commitments. However, at
                this stage, the Executive are ensuring that there is a joined-up
                approach to developing and exploring the possibilities for
                alternative sources of funding and public-private partnerships.
                Several Departments have presented their own ideas, and we
                welcome their initiative and interest. However, we believe that
                those are best followed through in our collective effort. That
                does not preclude further distinctive approaches being taken by
                different Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the Department for Regional
                Development will be disappointed at its lack of success in this
                round of Executive programme funds — the Deputy Chairperson of
                the Regional Development Committee has already registered his
                disappointment in that regard — that Department is a
                significant bidder for the infrastructure fund, which is not the
                subject of allocations at this stage.</p>

                particularly because the three bids by the Department of

                information (Public Record Office of Northern Ireland) and the
                Culture Northern Ireland web site bids were significant.
                However, the support for the soccer strategy must be seen as a
                major encouragement to all those who have contributed to that
                strategy and are working so hard to do something about soccer in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that this good work,

                last year in their first home-grown Budget as a way in which to
                open up the strategic opportunities available to us. As well as
                allowing us to have more strategic discretion than we might
                otherwise have as an Executive, any opportunity that the
                programme funds give us for deliberating together on the best

                fund? If so, what percentage of those funds are they likely to

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In regard to health, is the Minister aware
                that the funding needed to buy a scanner for the South Tyrone
                Hospital has been available for many years, but that there are
                no staff available to maintain that equipment? It is important
                that hospitals have up-to-date equipment, but it is of little
                use without staff. We need change that will benefit the entire

                Departments’ consideration in preparing bids. If Departments
                could articulate more clearly occasions where particular bids
                would have a beneficial impact on needs in rural areas, I would
                be happy for that to be made more manifest when the bids are
                made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not au fait with the funding that was
                available in the past for the South Tyrone Hospital. Details
                about hospital services fall to another Department so it is not
                for me, as Minister of Finance and Personnel, to address those
                issues. However, the Executive, through several in-year
                monitoring rounds — and announced by me on the Executive’s
                behalf — made allocations to deal with some of the
                consequential impacts of the South Tyrone Hospital situation
                because it has put pressures on services elsewhere. Although we
                have been dealing with some of the financial consequences of the
                South Tyrone Hospital situation, it is not for my Department or
                me to deal with the hospital issue itself.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister confirm that there are
                still some hard choices to be made and that the Committees have
                an important role to play in scrutinising their departmental
                budgets to ensure that money is spent effectively? Will the
                Minister go further and urge that all Committees should, as a
                matter of policy, closely consider reports from the Comptroller
                and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee? Many of
                their reports have been highly critical of departmental
                spending, particularly during the years of direct rule when
                proper scrutiny was not possible.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my Budget statement today I said that I
                hoped Committees would do their bit and exercise their
                responsibilities by scrutinising spending and the quality of the
                targeting and planning of public expenditure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The announcements that I make in the Chamber
                and the type of scrutiny that such statements are subjected to
                by questioning, and the subsequent scrutiny in Committees,
                scratches only the surface of major issues of public
                expenditure. The more scrutiny that can be applied at
                departmental level, the more effective it will be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Mr Dallat of the point I made
                earlier in relation to Seamus Close’s assertion that Executive
                programme funds are a grey area of public expenditure. They
                receive more scrutiny and accountability in the Assembly than
                the much bigger allocation decisions that are routinely taken by
                Departments. However, anything more that Committees can do to
                ensure greater scrutiny of public expenditure and to assure the
                public that best use of public money is being made would be well
                placed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is right that the relevant Committees
                should pay close attention to the reports from the Comptroller
                and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee,
                particularly in relation to the future work on audit and
                accountability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to see whether the Executive
                could provide more joined-up scrutiny in the Assembly by
                allowing the Public Accounts Committee to highlight budget lines
                where there have been particular concerns. In turn, the relevant
                Committee, knowing that there has been an issue, could follow up
                those budget lines over a period of some years. One must
                consider that in little over a year and a half there could be
                significant changes in the Chamber and in Committee memberships.
                This device would ensure that a concern raised at one point
                could be followed through over some years to ensure that
                recommendations are followed and implemented properly, which
                would be beneficial. More joined- up scrutiny would be an
                achievement for the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join other Members to welcome the Executive
                programme fund spending for next year. It is interesting that
                this innovative manner of dealing with cameo spending has been
                introduced in the Assembly and that it comes as a consequence of
                devolution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also interesting to note that there has
                been a great acceptance of this process, contrary to that
                evidenced in the Chamber when it was first introduced. I
                congratulate the Minister in presenting a clear budget for the
                Executive programme funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to ask a rather oblique question. Is
                there any mechanism by which bids can be made for Executive
                programme funding other than through Departments? In other
                words, can community groups apply directly to the Executive for
                funding? I have some experience of the particular requirement of
                cross-cutting departmental boundaries, where Departments are
                reluctant to take a lead in getting together. The area of New
                TSN is highly significant; it involves section 75 of the
                Northern Ireland Act 1998, and it is cross-cutting — so how
                can we handle this if a Department is not prepared to take the
                lead on a particular issue?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge the positive observations made
                by Eddie McGrady about how the role of Executive programme funds
                is now better understood, and I recognised that earlier.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the amounts of money involved in some
                of the tranches, it would not be feasible to open up the
                Executive programme funds to random bidding. Due to the fact
                that they are Executive programme funds, it is right that we ask
                Departments to advance bids, either on their own or working
                together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, when bids are brought forward, there
                is no reason why a Department would not effectively be acting as
                a sponsor for another group, whether they are non-departmental
                public bodies or, in some cases, relevant partners in the
                community and voluntary sector. We are taking that approach
                partly to avoid creating a bureaucracy around these funds. Some
                members of the Committee for Finance and Personnel appear
                concerned that there is a degree of bureaucracy even with the
                current shorthand approach. Those concerns would be more real if
                we were to open up the programme funds to general bidding. It
                would also make us less efficient in our allocation time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The one exception to that in the Executive
                programme funds has been the children’s fund. When the
                children’s fund was established, we deliberately said that an
                arm of the fund should be directly amenable to bidding by the
                community and voluntary sector. We are making good that
                commitment through a current consultation exercise to find the
                best way of providing for that — whether through some kind of
                intermediary funding body arrangement or through several other
                mechanisms that are set out in the consultation paper. It is
                important to do this and not just copy the Chancellor’s
                children’s fund across the water, as we are putting more money
                into it than would carry across from the Chancellor’s children’s
                fund.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we believe that when it comes to
                innovation in children’s services and dealing with children in
                need and youth at risk, the community and voluntary sector are
                in a position to make distinctive proposals. The result of that
                consultation will inform the next allocation from the children’s
                fund.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of the Committee, I welcome the
                provision for children with severe learning and physical
                difficulties to have access to information and communication
                technology. The Committee believed that that provision should
                have been an important feature of the Executive programme funds,
                and it is welcomed that the Minister has found funds for it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also pleased that the Minister has
                provided money for outreach workers in the upper Shankill and
                west, north and east Belfast. However, is the Minister aware
                that the Committee expressed concern at the inequality of
                provision, in view of the problems with youths right across the
                city? The unattached youth workers who will be funded by these
                programmes are an important component in dealing with that
                problem. There will be nine workers for upper Shankill and west
                Belfast and only five to cover all of east and north Belfast.
                The Committee asked for equality of provision, and I want to
                know why that was not listened to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat said that Committees ought to
                scrutinise how Departments spend money, and he is quite right.
                In the Executive programme funds I notice that, once again, the
                Minister is targeting money on the youngsters who are most
                vulnerable in the education system, with the Making a Good Start
                scheme being extended from primary one to primary two. That is
                in line with how the Minister has targeted money in previous
                announcements. However, is he aware that, despite all the extra
                money being spent, the Department of Education has reduced its
                targets for youngsters achieving satisfactory grades at Key
                Stage 2? The extra money is designed to help those children and
                youngsters who are truants at secondary school level. What
                scrutiny has the Minister’s Department undertaken to ensure
                that the funds help to raise targets? Targets should not be
                reduced at the same time that money is given.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the Member’s points are not for my
                Department, but rather for the Minister of Education and his
                Department. I reiterate that just because the Executive allocate
                money, the Department of Finance and Personnel recommends those
                allocations and I am presenting this statement, that does not
                make us responsible for micromanaging and micromonitoring every
                area of expenditure in each programme. It is up to the
                Departments to undertake and discharge their responsibilities.
                The Committees can make a contribution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We understood and were conscious that the
                Making a Good Start scheme was well supported by the Committee.
                We hope that we are making a contribution to improving prospects
                for children’s achievements and educational outcomes. We will
                pay attention to any evidence that the Committee or anyone else
                provides.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect to the outreach youth workers,
                the provision for upper Shankill and west Belfast is continued
                funding for something that is already there, and I note the
                Member’s appreciation for the work involved. The funding for
                north and east Belfast is to extend the programme. At this stage
                I cannot prejudge whether there will be further allocations to
                develop that programme in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee may wish to look at the wider
                issue of whether money is being used effectively. As I pointed
                out this morning, there are several needs and effectiveness
                evaluations under way, and one of those relates to schools. The
                Department of Education, the Department of Finance and Personnel
                and the Economic Policy Unit are considering some of these
                matters. I hope that, when we produce work on needs and
                effectiveness, the Committee will make some useful contributions
                to our thinking.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following the resolution of the Assembly on
                19 November 2001, the Ad Hoc Committee held its first meeting,
                and I was elected Chairperson.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that meeting, the Committee discussed its
                terms of reference and came to the unanimous conclusion that, as
                a Committee, we could not properly discharge our
                responsibilities to the Assembly — and to our constituents —
                if we were to consider such crucial and detailed proposals and
                report within the timescale that was set down. Mr Des Browne,
                the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, has extended the
                consultation date to 7 January; that timescale is still
                unworkable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is not oblivious to the bigger
                picture. It has considered that it can best make its input if it
                is given the opportunity to make its report by 14 January 2002.
                I believe that we can make our proposals and report by 14
                January. That will give time for the views of the Committee and
                the views of this House to be taken into consideration in time
                for any necessary amendments to the Bill at Westminster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Secretary of State gave the House an
                extremely limited period in which to consider crucial reforms to
                the system of criminal proceedings in Northern Ireland. The
                reforms will be of enormous significance for many years. It was
                absurd to bounce the House into dealing with the matter in three
                to four weeks. Rightly, the Committee felt that the Government
                should be told that the House would not be bounced in that way.
                We will take the time that we feel is necessary to deal
                appropriately with such matters.</p>
