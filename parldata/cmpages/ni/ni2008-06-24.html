	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Matters of the Day</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Murder in Londonderry</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mr Campbell has sought leave to make a statement on a matter that fulfils the  criteria set out in Standing Order 23A. I shall call Mr Campbell to speak for  up to three minutes on the subject. I shall then call a Member from each of the  other political parties, as agreed with the Whips; those Members will have up  to three minutes to speak. There will be no opportunity for interventions,  questions or for a vote on the matter. I shall not take any points of order  until the item of business is concluded. If that is clear, we shall proceed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I raise the very serious matter of a murder that has been committed in Londonderry in the early hours of this morning. I trust  that everyone in the House will offer their sympathies and condolences to the  family of the young man who was the victim of the attack. Murder, in any  circumstances, is wrong. It cannot be justified, defended or condoned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although it has only been a few hours since the attack,  there has been universal condemnation across the political divide &mdash; it is quite  right and proper that that should be so. More is required than simple  condemnation of such an attack &mdash; information is essential, and evidence is  required in order to bring the perpetrators to justice.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is hoped that the Assembly &mdash; speaking as it does for the  entire community across Northern Ireland &mdash; will send out a signal to the  community of the Creggan estate in Londonderry to do whatever it can to give  whatever information it has to the police in order to bring the perpetrators &mdash;  the murderers &mdash; to justice.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Murder was wrong 30 years ago. It could not be defended,  condoned or justified then; nor can it today. I hope that we can play a small  part in bringing to justice those who carried out that heinous act.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I am grateful to Gregory Campbell for  bringing the matter so swiftly to the notice of the Assembly. My colleagues  Martina Anderson and Raymond McCartney have been active in dealing with the  local response. Our community is shattered and shocked at what happened. The  deceased is my near neighbour &mdash; I know the family particularly well. I support  all that Members have said. The situation demands a community response, and any  information that can assist the PSNI in bringing the perpetrators to justice  should urgently be made available to it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Assembly stands for anything, it stands for  resolution of our many differences through dialogue and discussion. There is no  longer any scope for the gun in our society. I join Gregory Campbell in  offering condolences to the family and earnestly expressing the hope that the  perpetrators will be brought to justice swiftly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I first heard reports of the incident on a news bulletin while travelling here  this morning. Like everyone in the House, I am filled with shock and horror. I  extend my deepest sympathy to the victim&rsquo;s family circle.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I note with concern the emergence of increasing  intelligence that republican terrorist groups throughout the Province are  stepping up their activities. We need to know as soon as possible who carried  out the attack. In the light of this tragic death and the increase in such  activities, the usual description of the perpetrators as &ldquo;dissidents&rdquo; is no  longer acceptable. As soon as possible, the police must inform the public  explicitly who was responsible for that cold-blooded murder. Locally, there has  been some criticism of the police&rsquo;s response to the incident; but I have heard  the police&rsquo;s explanation and am content with it. In the light of recent attacks  in Castlederg and Rosslea, it is perfectly understandable and correct for the  police to have been cautious. Any injury or further loss of life would have  been another tragedy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I call on anyone who has the merest snippet of information  about that dastardly murder to pass it on to the PSNI.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I thank my colleague Gregory Campbell for seeking leave to make a statement,  because we need to pass on our sympathy and prayers to the family. I spoke with  family members this morning, and they are shocked and anguished. The father is  choked with emotion. However, they will appreciate and acknowledge the comments  from all the Members and parties represented in the Chamber.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The feeling in the city is that the hurt, grief and turmoil  are widely shared. In any circumstance, at any time, it is difficult to answer  a knock on the door and be told that a member of one&rsquo;s family has been killed,  but to be told that a relative has been executed in his own city is not nice.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People in the Creggan community are appalled and grieving  at the loss of a young man&rsquo;s life. The family also want it put on record that  anyone with information that leads to the arrest of those who perpetrated that  awful deed in Derry should come forward. I  accept Gregory&rsquo;s point that no community should have to face or accept that  type of violence under the new dispensation. There is hope, and, outside the  House, people wish for the murder and mayhem of the past to remain in the past.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is a sad reflection of society that such violence  continues. As a result, a young man of 22 years of age has lost his life,  leaving a grieving family. It is important that communities, irrespective of  whether they are in Derry, Belfast  or elsewhere, marginalise and give no comfort to those in the community who,  for whatever logic or reason, carry out violence of any description. Such  people should be marginalised and be given no comfort whatever. They carried  out such acts in the past for ideological reasons, but should not now be  conducting a campaign that leads to violence.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I repeat what other Members said: people must come forward  with information. It is grand to express sympathy to the family of the victim,  but in order to deter further similar acts of violence, intelligence and  evidence must be produced that can put those who are responsible for such  awfulness behind bars.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am grateful to Mr Campbell for bringing the matter to the attention of the  House. I join with the other party spokespersons and express the sympathy of  the Alliance Party to the family concerned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The murder was extremely brutal and appalling. It is a  tragedy, not just for the family, but for the entire community in Derry. The most poignant comment that can be made is that  a young child who will be born in the next few days will grow up without a  father. Those who are responsible for this brutal attack should reflect on  that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We should be at a stage in society where the justification  &mdash; or the lack of &mdash; for murder is not discussed. There can be no justification,  in any circumstances, for murder. We should not need to qualify that point.  Murder is the most heinous crime, and there is no place for it in this or in  any other society in the world, given that it constitutes a major threat to the  rule of law.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is speculation as to whether this murder was carried  out by dissident republicans or by organised criminals. I agree that there is  an urgent need for the police to clarify who was responsible as soon as  possible. That said, I have confidence in the ability of our Police Service to  respond robustly and effectively to this and to other serious crimes that occur  in Northern Ireland.  I endorse calls for the community to work closely with the police to bring  those who are responsible for this heinous crime to justice as soon as  possible.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Assembly Business</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I ask that the Speaker considers making a  ruling on a matter on which the &lsquo;Northern Ireland Assembly Companion&rsquo; is  silent. Given that silence, I checked Erskine May on the matter on which I  think that you should make a ruling. Page 74 of Erskine May reports a  resolution that was made by the Public Service Committee of the House of  Commons. Inter alia, that resolution states that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;it is of paramount importance that ministers give  accurate&hellip;information to Parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the  earliest opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If that is the standard that is expected of Ministers in  giving information to the House of Commons, should the same standards not apply  here? Indeed, should that apply not just to Ministers, but to the Assembly  Commission and to the Speaker?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has exhausted that particular subject. I know where he is  going, given that he has raised the same subject twice in the House. I have  already told the Member &mdash; and the entire House &mdash; that I will not take any  further points of order on that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member knows that if he wants to ask either a question  for oral answer or a question for written answer on issues that relate to the  Commission, he can do so quite freely. That is the avenue that he should  pursue; he should not raise further points of order on this matter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker, I am not asking for a particular  comment from you on any matter reported to this House; I am asking you to make  a ruling on whether the Speaker is obliged, in the event that there has been  inadvertence &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member is coming very, very close to challenging the authority of  the Speaker, and I warn him very, very closely on that issue. It is not an  appropriate point of order for this House.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Further to the point of order. I will explore all other avenues in order to  ensure that a standard is set for this House that all who report to it must  attain.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I am happy for the Member to come and talk to me on the subject that he has  raised, and to which he has referred in the House on two previous occasions.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council &mdash; Education Sectoral  Meeting</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I have received notice from the Minister of Education that she wishes &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. The cover-page of a statement that Members  have received from the Minister this morning is totally in Irish. When I picked  up the document outside the Chamber, I was unsure about the content of what I  was lifting. Will you rule as to whether that statement&rsquo;s front page should be  in English, so that Members know what they are picking up?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  What the Minister has done is quite correct. The statement is in both Irish and  English.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Further to the point of order, Mr Speaker. I am not disputing that it is in  Irish. I want the front page translated into English to enable Members to know  what they are picking up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That is not a matter on which the Speaker can rule. It is an issue on which the  Minister may consider Members&rsquo; points of view. I call the Minister of Education  to make a statement on the North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC).</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat. First of all, the statement is  in English and Irish to enable Members to choose which they prefer to read.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Le do chead, a Cheann Comhairle, ba mhaith liom r&aacute;iteas a  dh&eacute;anamh ar chruinni&uacute; den Chomhairle Aireachta Thuaidh/Theas i bhform&aacute;id  rannach oideachais. Tion&oacute;ladh an cruinni&uacute; seo in Ardscoil De La Salle, D&uacute;n  P&aacute;draig ar 28 Bealtaine 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Roimh an chruinni&uacute; d&rsquo;&oacute;st&aacute;il m&eacute; f&aacute;ilti&uacute; do phr&iacute;omhoid&iacute; &oacute;  gach earn&aacute;il scoile sa cheantar &aacute;iti&uacute;il. D&rsquo;ionadaigh m&eacute; an Coiste Feidhmi&uacute;ch&aacute;in  mar Aire Oideachais, in &eacute;ineacht le Edwin Poots CTR, an tAire Cult&uacute;ir, Eala&iacute;on  agus F&oacute;ill&iacute;ochta.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That translates as: with your permission, Mr Speaker, I  wish to make a statement regarding a meeting of the North/South Ministerial  Council (NSMC) in its education sectoral format. The meeting was held at De La  Salle High School in Downpatrick, County   Down, on 28 May 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Before the formal meeting convened, I hosted a reception  for school principals from all school sectors in the area. I represented the  Executive as Minister of Education. The then Minister of Culture, Arts and  Leisure, Edwin Poots, also attended. The Irish Govern&shy;ment was represented by  Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, TD and Minister for Education and Science, whom I welcomed to  his first NSMC meeting. I look forward to meeting him again at the next  meeting, which will be in the South of Ireland. My statement has been agreed  with Edwin Poots and is made on behalf of us both.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The main points that emerged from the meeting range across  all the agreed areas of educational co-operation, and I will summarize them as  follows: on the issue of education, underachievement, joint presentations were  given on best practice in Travellers&rsquo; education and on the role of school  leadership in tackling underachievement for all children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The presentation on best practice for school leadership was  led by Dr Tom Hesketh, director of the regional training unit. It also involved  Adeline Dinsmore, principal of Ashfield Girls&rsquo; High School in Belfast;  Patrick McAleavey, principal of St Patrick&rsquo;s High School, Keady, County Armagh;  Barry Sharvin, principal of De La Salle High School, Downpatrick; and Paddy  Flood, the national co-ordinator of leadership development for schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The NSMC welcomed continuing practical co-operation to  address educational underachievement, particularly in literacy and numeracy,  and considered proposals for enhancing joint working, such as holding a joint  conference for education professionals on the subject of numeracy in primary  schools. That conference will be part of a joint approach to sharing best  practice and identifying common research needs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The NSMC agreed to convene a joint working group on educational  underachievement that will initially consider the approach adopted in each  jurisdiction towards raising overall levels of achieve&shy;ment and to tackling  underachievement, particularly among more disadvantaged groups such as  lower-income families, Travellers and young people from ethnic minorities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The working group will report progress to the next NSMC  meeting in education sectoral format.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We welcomed the proposal to organise a conference on best  practice in the education of children from the Traveller community, and we look  forward to receiving the published report, which will contribute to the develop&shy;ment  of specific objectives and targets in that area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">D&rsquo;fh&aacute;iltigh an Chomhairle fosta roimh bhun&uacute; coiste um  oideachas ph&aacute;ist&iacute; Lucht Taistil ag mo Roinn, agus t&aacute; mo Roinn ag dr&eacute;im le  bheith ag comhoibri&uacute; leis an Roinn Oideachais agus Eola&iacute;ochta sa todhcha&iacute;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council also welcomed my Department&rsquo;s establishment of  a committee for the education of Traveller children and look forward to its  future collaborative work with the Department of Education and Science.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council discussed steps to help to train teachers to  achieve the Irish-language qualification required for teaching in schools in  the South of Ireland, thereby improving cross-border mobility. We noted that  teachers pursuing the Irish-language qualification can avail themselves of  training programmes that exist in several areas. In addition, information  seminars on the primary-school curriculum are provided by the primary  curriculum support programme in the Monaghan Education Centre to assist  teachers seeking employment in Southern schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council welcomed the ongoing co-operation between the  respective inspectorates of the Department of Education (DE) and the Department  of Education and Science, including the agreement of a protocol for exchanges.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Chuir an Chomhairle f&aacute;ilte roimh an chomhoibri&uacute; lean&uacute;nach  idir cigireachta&iacute; na Ranna Oideachais faoi seach, lena n-&aacute;ir&iacute;tear comhaont&uacute; ar  phr&oacute;tacal ar mhalartuithe.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We welcomed the standing conference on teacher education,  North and South, including that on citizenship education and special  educational needs, and we look forward to the outcome of its work on school  leadership policy and practice. We noted that the regional training unit and  the programme on leadership development for schools continue to work on a  collaborative basis on leadership development issues and have agreed to develop  a joint research project that will concentrate on how best to attract and  develop new school leaders.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We also noted the progress that has been made by the  working group that is considering the transfer of pension rights. The group is  gathering evidence on the difficulties experienced by teachers as a result of  the inability to transfer pension entitlements between both jurisdictions. It  will report back to a future North/South Ministerial Council meeting.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council welcomed the significant progress that has been  made on the development of the Centre of Excellence for Autism at Middletown in County   Armagh and the fact that  the centre has begun to deliver training courses. The autism research and  information service is being developed and will begin delivery after the  current recruitment exercise. The education assessment service and the learning  support service will come on stream at a later date, because the new building  must be completed in order to facilitate those two functions. The Council  welcomed the progress that has been made by the centre in its consultations  with parents, professionals and others to inform how the proposed services will  be delivered, and we look forward to a formal report on the outcomes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Thug muid faoi deara an rath a bh&iacute; ar an stoc&aacute;ireamh ar  uathachas a rinne an Roinn Oideachais agus an Chigireacht Oideachais agus  Oili&uacute;na ar 10 agus 11 M&aacute;rta 2008. Bainfear &uacute;s&aacute;id as an stoc&aacute;ireamh seo le plean  strait&eacute;iseach ar an uathachas a ullmh&uacute; don Roinn Oideachais chomh maith le  comhsmaointeoireacht strait&eacute;iseach a cheapadh ar an uathachas. Thug an  Chomhairle faoi deara fosta an rath a bh&iacute; ar an chomhdh&aacute;il ar neamhoird  speictrim uathaigh a tion&oacute;ladh ar 15 Aibre&aacute;n i bP&aacute;irc an Chr&oacute;caigh i mBaile  &Aacute;tha Cliath.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We noted the success of the autism stocktake by the  Department of Education and the Education and Training Inspectorate on 10 and  11 March 2008. That will inform the development of an autism strategic plan for  the Department of Education, as well as establishing common strategic thinking  about autism. The Council also noted the success of the conference on autistic  spectrum disorder that was held on 15 April 2008 at Croke  Park in Dublin.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We noted the successful outcomes of the cross-border school  and parent community partnership programme, which include the development of  teaching and learning aids for autism, speech and language.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council was updated on educational exchanges and noted  the ongoing co-operation between Departments. In 2008, 20 school- and  youth-based exchange programmes will be undertaken.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that a review of educational exchanges  and supporting mechanisms has recently been completed. We are considering the  recommendations and the appropriate joint processes and approaches that will be  required to manage and co-ordinate educational exchanges in the future. The  Council asked officials to report back on the progress on gaining agreement on  a joint approach for the future management and funding of educational  exchanges.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We agreed that the next meeting of the North/South  Ministerial Council in education sectoral format should take place in autumn  2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ar deireadh, shocraigh muid go dtion&oacute;lfa&iacute; an ch&eacute;ad  chruinni&uacute; eile den Chomhairle Aireachta Thuaidh/Theas i bhform&aacute;id rannach  oideachais i bhf&oacute;mhar na bliana 2008. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr Storey)</strong>: The Minister mentioned the  significant progress in the development of a centre of excellence for autism in  Middletown. She  also said that the centre has begun to deliver training courses, which is one  of its four functions. The Committee for Education recently received a briefing  paper on autism from a key organisation in the sector. We plan to question  representatives from the centre at Middletown  in early September.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, many parents are concerned about the significant  delay in delivering the centre of excellence, given that it was first announced  in 2002. The project to develop a centre of excellence has received  considerable public funding &mdash; in the region of several million pounds.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What is the total amount of funding &mdash; broken down into  capital and revenue &mdash; that the Department has allocated to the Middletown centre for autism since 2002? How  does that represent value for money and, most importantly, service delivery for  those people to whose futures the centre of excellence is essential?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I welcome the Member&rsquo;s interest in the Middletown centre for autism, which is a  wonderful project. The deputy First Minister and I visited the centre, and it  is doing tremendous work. At the conference in Croke Park,  representatives from the centre delivered a compelling presentation on their  work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The centre has been operational since December 2007, when  training delivery began. The research and information service will begin after  further staff recruitment. The educational assessment service and learning  support service will come on stream when building work is completed, which is  expected to be in autumn 2009. The senior management team is meeting education  providers, North and South, to ascertain requirements. It is working on several  areas, including staff recruitment, the development of the referral mechanisms,  the development of a training prospectus and training delivery.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The board of directors of the Middletown centre for autism has met  regularly since March 2007. The chief executive and the three heads of division  are all in post. A further recruitment exercise is under way for training,  research and administrative staff. Since December 2007, several training courses  have been held in the newly refurbished accommodation on site. The centre  commissioned an extensive consultation exercise with all relevant stakeholders  involved with children and young people with autism in venues across Ireland &mdash;  north, south, east and west &mdash; in December 2007 and January 2008. The purpose of  that consultation was to inform and invite comments on how the centre will  deliver the proposed services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Funding for the purchase and cost of the Middletown centre is divided equally between  the Department of Education and the Department of Education and Science in the  South. At its education sectoral meeting on 11 April 2002, the North/South  Ministerial Council jointly endorsed the decision to establish the Middletown centre for  autism.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There were delays, but I am not going to take  responsibility for direct rule delays. I assure Members that we are proceeding  at full speed with the further development of the Middletown centre of excellence for autism. I  have also met parents and representatives of organisations who work for  children with autism, and I welcome the work that has been conducted to date.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member enquired about the cost of the centre. The  Department of Education spent &pound;1&middot;5 million on the purchase of the property. The  annual running costs of the centre are estimated at approximately &pound;3 million  per annum and will be shared equally between the Department of Education in the  North and the Department of Education and Science in the South. The building  and refurbishment costs were estimated at approximately &pound;3&middot;5 million in total.  However, in line with general increases in building costs, some of those  estimates have risen, and officials are currently working through the detail.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that all Members will agree on the benefits and  importance of the initiative, as well as the many other initiatives that have  been undertaken about autism.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. My question is also about the Middletown centre of  excellence for autism. An increasing number of children have autistic spectrum  disorders; therefore, I welcome the significant progress that the Minister  reported today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The centre in Middletown  has four main functions, including the educational assessment service and the  learning support service, which will cater for children with autism who cannot  be catered for in the standard educational setting. Another key function of the  centre will be the research and information service, which will benefit all  children with autism as more research is conducted about their specific needs.  Will the Minister comment on the benefits for all children with autism?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat as an cheist sin agus as an r&aacute;iteas sin. The  Member rightly talked about the important services that the Middletown Centre  for Autism will provide. The centre will be dedicated to improving the  education opportunities for children and young people with autistic spectrum  disorders. It is planned that the centre will provide an educational assessment  service; a learning support service; a training and advisory service for  parents, teachers and other professionals; and, as the Member said, a research  and information service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Provision will be made for the comprehensive educational  assessment of children with a view to provide enhanced individual education  plans. That may include a two-day to three-day multidisciplinary education  assessment, and/or a five-week residential multidisciplinary education and  learning support assessment that involves pre- and post-placement visits to  parents, schools and other professionals who are involved with the children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The centre will be multidisciplinary and will work in  collaboration with local services. It will not replace or prevent the  development of local provision, but will seek to enhance or support existing  services through collaborative working arrangements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The centre will work in co-ordination with all the other  strategies that are being implemented in the Department of Education. One of  the major benefits is that professionals in the field are currently learning  from one another and sharing best practices. The conference that I attended in Croke Park  was a wonderful example of that. All the people I talked to said that it was a  good conference and that more such initiatives and events should be undertaken.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An autism stocktake was also conducted this year with a  forum of administrators, special-needs professionals and education inspectors  from Scotland, Wales and the  North and South of Ireland, at which autism provision across the education  sector was considered. The administrators exchanged examples of good practice,  including research in children&rsquo;s early years. The event was organised by the  Department of Education. I met all the people at the conference, which was a  preparatory step in the development of the autism strategy in the North.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Officials and inspectors will develop a plan that they will  present to me to map out a draft strategy for the provision of effective and  consistent autism services for children across the North.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Minister address the issue of the location of the centre of excellence  for autism? I have heard some suggestions that it should be located beside  hospitals with high research capabilities. The fact that it is not appears to  be a bit of a problem. Was the issue raised during the consultation that the  Minister conducted? Furthermore, will she explain to the Assembly why the vast  majority of stakeholders who were consulted are against the location of the  centre in Middletown?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does she agree that, if there is one issue that should not  be politicised, it is dealing with services for those on the autistic spectrum?  Will she give an undertaking to lead the charge to ensure that &mdash; for the sake  of those children &mdash; the issue is not politicised?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: First, the centre is ideally located; it is a North/South  centre. Children will travel to it from all corners of the island. I absolutely  agree that the issue should not be politicised. Equally, I throw that right  back and ask every party not to politicise the issue, because we are dealing  with some of the most vulnerable children in society who need the most  professional help.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that Mr McCrea&rsquo;s colleague the Minister of Health  would be concerned at any suggestion, which I am sure that the Member is not  making, that health provision in the Armagh  area is not what it should be. Health provision is provided across the North;  it is essential that there be no regional disparity in the provision of those  services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The centre&rsquo;s site is wonderful. It is important that people  visit to see that for themselves. I do not accept that a vast majority of  consultees raised concerns about the site. The site is ideally located for  children across the island. We must get our shoulders to the wheel to support  that innovative project. It is one of many of projects right across the North;  we have projects in Belfast, Derry and Armagh which deal with a range of educational issues and  cater for the North and South.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Member for saying that the issue should not be  politicised. I hope that that will not happen.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.

Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Speaker. It is very clear in Assembly rules that speeches  must be translated into English. We are not going to allow this to happen.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I thank the Member for that point of order. Members on all sides of the House  know by now that when they choose to speak in another language they must also  provide an English translation.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I apologise, Mr Speaker. I got carried  away with the passion of my question; it was not an attempt to insult the  House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Why is the Irish language qualification for teachers not  available in the two teacher-training colleges in Northern Ireland, either as a part  of the teaching degree or as an in-service course? Will the Minister do all in  her power to ensure that that course is made available in one of the two  teacher-training colleges in Belfast?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that I provided an accurate translation, Mr Speaker;  from memory, it comes close. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat. First, I welcome the decision &mdash; taken at  the North/South Ministerial Council education sectoral meeting at De La Salle  High School, in Downpatrick &mdash; that steps will be taken to facilitate graduating  teachers in achieving the necessary Irish language qualification for teaching  in the South of Ireland. The proposal to share the detail of that, including  the means by which the necessary qualification can be achieved, at an early  stage with student teachers and their lecturers will help to facilitate  mobility for those interested in pursing some part of their teaching career in  the South.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Together with Reg Empey&rsquo;s Department and our colleagues in  the South, I am currently working on the detail, and I expect that that  proposal will become a reality very soon. In relation to the Member&rsquo;s question,  I am also in discussion with Reg Empey about teacher training and courses. We  have come to an arrangement regarding St Mary&rsquo;s and Stranmillis that I very  much welcome. We are also exploring further many different issues.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Minister knows that my party and I are not hostile to the Irish language,  but I will follow up on the last area of questioning. The Minister talked about  trying to facilitate our citizens in gaining qualifications in Irish so that  they are able to teach in the South of Ireland. However, is there not a  stronger case for making representations to the Government of the Republic of Ireland to relax or remove that  restriction?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not necessary to know Irish to teach maths, physics,  science, history or geography. It is a restrictive practice. Bearing in mind  that Southern citizens do not need that qualification to teach in Northern Ireland,  it would be fair to lift that criterion and encourage the use of Irish through  other methods. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat. Maith th&uacute;. I do not think that I need to  translate that for the Member.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that the requirement of the South&rsquo;s education system  in relation to Irish language competency presents challenges for some of our  student and graduate teachers. However, it is the national language of Ireland, so I  do not think that that is an unreasonable requirement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That said, in any education system &mdash; our own included &mdash; there  is an expectation that teachers should be able to teach across the full  curriculum. The primary curriculum in the South has a very clear and integral  Irish-language component that runs throughout it, including the fields of  maths, science, history and language. Those responsible for education policy  and delivery deemed that it is necessary for teachers to have the ability to  deliver that aspect of the curriculum, which I fully understand and respect.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have, however, been in discussions about this issue, and  I welcome the steps that were taken in recent years to review the requirement.  It applies now only in the primary sector. In the post-primary sector, it  applies only for the teaching of Irish and teaching through the medium of  Irish. Teachers now have much more time in which to study and gain the  qualification, even for the primary sector. The practice of differential rates  of pay has also changed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome from Southern colleagues the offer of  information seminars designed to explain exactly what the requirement is for  both students and academic staff in our teacher-education colleges who may be  interested in applying for posts in the South. That is a very practical and  helpful offer of support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A different but related issue is that of what can be done  to ensure that teachers are not discouraged from moving to live and work on  either side of the border. It is possible that the absence of any facility to  transfer pension entitlements could impact on that. The issue was raised at one  of the North/South Ministerial Council meetings. The obstacles to pension  rights were considered &mdash; not just in education, but right across the board. A  working group was set up to address that issue, and we wait for officials to  report back with its findings.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  In her statement on cross-border co-operation, the Minister referred to school  exchanges and youth exchanges; a review of educational exchanges; consideration  of recommendations; and proposed joint processes, management and co-ordination.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As we sit here in Stormont, I remind the Minister that we  are closer to Galloway than we are to Galway; we are as close to Dumfries as we  are to Dublin; and the North   Channel is a very narrow sea. Will she, therefore, tell us what  plans she has to develop and support direct east-west exchanges, so that they  are supported equally with North/South exchanges and that there is no  differential or disparity?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will she tell us whether she has discussed that with the  Scottish Education Minister? What progress has been made in that area? For many  children in Northern Ireland,  their cultural connections are much more identifiable with Scotland than they are with the Irish Republic.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: County   Louth is near Newry.  There is a road network between both parts of the island, and it is essential  that we learn from each other and share best practice. Equally, it is important  that we learn from our colleagues in England,  Scotland and Wales. When  speaking earlier about autism, I said that we had autism professionals from England, Scotland,  Wales  and the North and South of Ireland. It is important to develop exchanges at  different levels across the island, and between England,  Scotland and Wales and the  island, and I look forward to continuing that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I discussed the close links between Scotland and Ireland,  and I am interested in examining Gaelic education in Scotland. A lot of work can be done  and we can learn much from that system. I had a good meeting with the Scottish  Minister for Schools and Skills, when the issue of underachievement was among  the issues discussed, and I have since received information from her on how Scotland  tackles underachievement. We will examine that issue with our colleagues in the  South and in Scotland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh r&aacute;iteas an Aire.  Is maith an rud &eacute; go bhfuil an dul chun cinn suntasach d&eacute;anta ar &aacute;bhair &eacute;ags&uacute;la  i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais ar fud na t&iacute;re.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister give more detail on initiatives aimed at  increasing and improving mobility between teachers, North and South? Is the  significant surplus &mdash; or over-provision &mdash; of teachers in the North comparable  to the deficit of teachers in the South?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, I will welcome additional detail on the  significance of the autism stocktake and how it was carried out.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat as an cheist sin. It is important that all  obstacles to mobility across the island are removed, and work has been carried  out to identify options to resolve that problem. A teacher superannuation group  was set up as part of the North/South Ministerial Council education work  programme. That group identified a range of options for effecting transfer  arrangements, as well as other complex issues to be addressed, including the  implications for other public-sector schemes &mdash; particularly those with a high  degree of movement of members &mdash; and the differential treatment of state pension  arrangements. Given the cross-sectoral implications of any change in the  existing pension arrangements, the North/South Ministerial Council meeting &mdash;  led by the esteemed Member opposite, Ian Paisley Snr, and Martin McGuinness &mdash;  agreed that a broad-based approach was preferred. The joint secretariat  subsequently convened a working group of officials from relevant Departments &mdash;  including Finance Departments &mdash; to consider the transfer of pension rights, in  general, on a cross-border basis. The Member will agree that I have already  answered the question on the Irish-medium sector, to ensure that we can have  maximum exchanges.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, prior to the conference in Croke Park,  the autism inspectors from Ireland,  England, Scotland and Wales met to prepare for the autism  strategy. A wonderful amount of work on special needs and autism is going on,  North and South. I thank the Member for his interest in the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Minister Ruane will recall that, at that North/South Ministerial Council  meeting, I raised the issue of transient children, as opposed to Traveller  children. It was agreed that that issue would not be dealt with under the  North/South regime, but by the Minister herself. What subsequent steps has she  taken to end the discriminatory practices against Army children that were  introduced by her predecessor in the previous devolved Administration? Those  changed the rules, which now work against children from the migrant community?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: As the Member will know, that is not a North/South issue,  because there are no British forces in the South of Ireland. As I said, I wrote  to the then Minister about those issues, as they are not within the remit of  the North/South Ministerial Council. There is a forum that deals with the issue  of transient children. I absolutely refute the suggestion that there is any  discrimination. In fact, transient children have a higher weighting than other  children, apart from socially disadvantaged children, like those from the  Travelling community and ethnic-minority groups. I absolutely refute the  suggestion that there is discrimination; there is none. The Department is  represented on a forum in relation to that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The additional funding for children of army personnel is  0&middot;2 of the basic age-weighted pupil unit &mdash; a cash value per pupil in 2008-09 of  &pound;393&middot;23. That is intended to support schools in inducting those children during  their transition to a new school and new curricular environment, and in  designing learning programmes to bring them to the same stage as other pupils  already in the school. There are 613 such pupils in the primary sector, and  that costs &pound;241,050; in the secondary sector there are 158, with a cost of  &pound;62,131; and in the grammar sector there are 93, with a cost of &pound;36,571. That  comes to a total of &pound;339,702. I do not know how anyone can say that there is  discrimination in that regard.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will also be aware that, in the recommendations  for review, Local Management of Schools (LMS) members have called for the  weighting of the children of service personnel to be raised from the current  level of 0&middot;2. That issue was not progressed at the time it was raised, pending  further assessment of the needs and additional costs associated with children  in that group. The issue is kept under review, including as part of the review  of special educational needs and the review of formula funding arrangements.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Given the Minister&rsquo;s fixation with post-primary education, and her constant  reference to the tail of underachievement in literacy and numeracy, will she  now expand on what kind of practical co-operation the North/South Ministerial  Council can bring to bear on that crucial area, in order to make a measurable  difference? That deep-seated problem, which precedes the age of 11, was flagged  up by the Department in 2002, when it told the Public Accounts Committee that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;it was indefensible that around 20% of children left  school unable to master the basics of reading and writing.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Westminster Public Accounts Committee, in a  report dated 27 November 2006, also expressed its concern on the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I thank the Member for his question, and for his interest in  underachievement; he will know that I share that interest. I absolutely refute  his statement that I am obsessed with transfer from primary to post-primary  schools. In fact, this morning I have been speaking about special needs,  Travellers, and underachievement. I am clear that I am here to work for the  benefit of all children. One of the reasons why I put educational  underachievement on the agenda of the North/South Ministerial Council is that I  care deeply about all of our children. I am particularly concerned about the  children who are failed by our system. That cannot continue to happen.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department has established a working group on  educational underachievement. I strongly insisted that we listened to the  leaders of schools that have done the business. They are the people who know  what needs to be done. That is why we spent the majority of the meeting  listening to those school leaders; to the regional training unit; to its  counterpart in Dublin; to Adeline Dinsmore from Ashfield Girls&rsquo; High; to Pat  McAleavey; and to the key points in dealing with underachievement. I am sure  that Edwin Poots will agree that that was a very useful part of the meeting.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A working group has been set up, which the relevant senior  policy leaders in both Departments jointly chair. It will report to the next  North/South Ministerial Council education sectoral meeting, which will be held  in autumn 2008. During the summer, officials in my Department will liaise  closely with counterparts in Dublin  on those arrangements and on membership of the group. We will provide details  of that as soon as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The working group will also co-ordinate the work of existing  joint working groups on literacy and numeracy and on attendance and retention  in order to ensure that the current work of those groups is linked at strategic  level with wider efforts to tackle underachievement. It will also be charged  with identifying the scope for additional joint working in other areas of  mutual benefit, such as joint research and joint dissemination of research  findings. It will liaise with the existing joint working group on teacher  qualifications and teachers&rsquo; superannuation in order to ensure that work on  school leadership and teachers&rsquo; development is linked more closely with efforts  to tackle educational underachievement. School leadership is a key element of  that. It has been identified as a critical success factor for driving up  standards in schools for all children. It is important that the steps that are  taken to share learning and to promote best practice in that area are fully  integrated into the agenda for the working group on educational  underachievement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that I issued a consultation document  yesterday on tackling underachievement. I am aware that right before the summer  is probably not the best time to launch such a document, but I was not prepared  to sit on the matter. I did not want to waste any time. However, I have  extended the consultation period. I welcome everyone&rsquo;s contributions, because I  understand that every Member shares my concerns about the underachievement of  many of our young people. Therefore, we can learn much from one other. My  Department will work closely with the Department of Education and Science in  the South on the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  My question also relates to the Middletown  centre. However, I have no criticism to make; indeed, I absolutely welcome the  centre. The children who will attend the autism centre must remain there for  five weeks. I am concerned about the duration of that five-week stay, because  autistic children rely on familiar surroundings and people at all times. I  wonder whether that lengthy five-week stay was negotiated with parents. Can the  Minister assure the House that parents are content about it?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I welcome the Member&rsquo;s words of support for the Middletown centre. As she does, I believe  that the centre is extremely important. As I have said, provision will be made  for comprehensive educational assessments of the children to be carried out  with a view to providing enhanced individual education plans. The point is that  those plans must be individual; they cannot be &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo;. Every  child, and his or her personal circumstances, is different. Some children will  live near the centre, while others may be from as far away as Cork,  Mayo, Galway, Ballymena or Derry. Therefore,  every child will be considered individually.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, arrangements will be made for the children. A  multidisciplinary educational and learning-support assessment will be carried  out that involves pre- and post-placement visits to parents, schools and other  professionals. There will be close working with children and parents. I am not  sure whether the Member has visited the Middletown  centre, but it is well worth a visit. It is a wonderful site, which has been  specifically adapted and is perfect for the children. It is a centre of which  we can be proud.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: It  is interesting that Mr McElduff referred to a surplus of teacher-training  places, yet the Minister wants to create extra places at St Mary&rsquo;s University College.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister will be aware that, for many young people who  live in deprived areas, education offers a way out &mdash; it can lead to social  mobility and an escape from poverty. Does the Minister recognise that her  proposals for the future of education in Northern Ireland will deny many  people that chance to escape from deprivation? Furthermore, will the Minister  indicate to the House what discussion she has had with her counterpart in the  Irish Republic about the fact that, particularly in Dublin, parents who have  lots of money are able to buy houses that are within the catchment areas of the  best schools?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I welcome the Member&rsquo;s concerns about socially disadvantaged  children. I respectfully suggest, however, that he reads the research and  examines the percentages of free school meals that are taken up in grammar  schools. Therein lies the answer to the Member&rsquo;s question, so I do not agree  with his point.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My proposals will give every child a fair chance. The  present system is deeply unfair and deeply unjust. The proposals will change  that system. At present, we are failing 12,000 young people; 47% of young  people leave school without GCSEs in English and maths. I am sure that Members  would not want their children to leave school without passing GCSE English and  maths.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A fair system for all children must be created. I have  already stated the admissions criteria. I look forward to a public welcome from  the DUP; we will consider introducing social justice criteria to ensure that  children are not disadvantaged. I am liaising with my counterparts in the South  on educational underachieve&shy;ment. We will ensure that there is no postcode  lottery, which currently exists. Certain children are advantaged, and a huge  number of children are disadvantaged.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My proposals will bring about a fundamental overhaul of the  education system in the North. For the first time, all children &mdash; not just some  &mdash; will be helped to realise their full potential. In doing so, academic  excellence must be kept in the system while ensuring that different pathways  are kept open for all children at every possible point. I am sure that all  Members will agree that the testing of children at the age of 11 to decide life  pathways on the basis of the result of two one-hour tests is not the way to go.  The examples of Finland  and other Scandinavian countries, which do not operate a selective system, show  that there is a better way to do things. We must move forward to bring about  the necessary changes for all children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, there are 50,000 empty desks. Last week, I met  a Member from the opposite Benches, who came to me with representatives from  secondary schools who were crying out for change. As we heard last week, change  is necessary because the secondary sector is bearing the brunt of demographic  decline, and that is deeply and utterly unfair. I look forward to working with  all parties in the coming weeks and months, but make no mistake: we will change  the system and bring about an end to academic selection, which has been unfair  to children.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Minister advised that discussions took place on educational  underachievement, particularly for disadvantaged groups. Has any discussion  taken place on the adverse educational effect on areas of need arising from her  decision to reduce extended schools funding and not to fund breakfast clubs and  after-school clubs? Do the Government in the Irish Republic,  for example, provide educational assistance in that area? Were there any  discussions about how breakfast clubs and after-school clubs can give  additional educational and family support and, therefore, assist those who have  been underachieving in schools?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I presume that the Member is referring to projects that were  previously funded by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety rather than by the Department of Education. I am delighted that the  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has resolved that issue  by deciding to continue to fund those projects.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In previous debates, I have been clear on the issue of  extended schools. I wrote to the Minister of Finance and Personnel on many  occasions as soon as I took up office; the number of times that I did that is  on the record. I raised my concerns with the then Minister of Finance and  Personnel about the cuts to the extended schools programme. I informed him that  I would be unable to mainstream the &pound;38 million that was given to extended  schools activities, which was part of an overall package in which four  Departments were involved. I have been clear about that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To date, I have been disappointed by the former Minister of  Finance&rsquo;s response, and I am waiting for the new Minister of Finance to respond  to my request concerning extended schools. I have explained to him that the  cuts have had a detrimental impact, and that I have managed to mainstream &pound;16  million of funding. However, the argument that all of it should have been  mainstreamed is totally wrong.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Every Member has been writing to me about the extended  schools programme, and rightly so. Consequently, I urge Members to inform the  Minister of Finance that I have raised the matter. I have requested further  funding, and I am waiting for confirmation of that funding. Cutting the  extended schools programme is not the way to proceed, and I look forward to  receiving the money that is required for that programme as soon as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The problem is that schools are planning activities as we  speak, and they need to know how their personnel will be paid for. Some will be  organising summer activities, and I note that schools in Newry are getting  together under the extended schools programme to organise summer activities  such as breakfast clubs, after-school clubs, homework clubs, sports and drama.  If we are to make a difference, it is important to receive &mdash; and I look forward  to receiving &mdash; the funding necessary for the extended schools programme.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I note the Minister&rsquo;s reply about the need for change in education, and nobody  is disputing that. Borrowing a phrase that is doing the rounds in America &mdash; the  problem is whether it is change in which we can believe, and the Minister should  reflect on that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, I welcome the statement. I refer the Minister  to yesterday&rsquo;s debate about teacher training in Stranmillis  University College  and St Mary&rsquo;s University   College. Given the  comprehensive nature of education work North and South, will the Minister  urgently place on the NSMCs agenda ways in which students and teachers in the  South, where there is a lack of teacher-training capacity, could train at Stranmillis University  College or St Mary&rsquo;s University College?  Such measures should apply to first-teacher-training requirements and  in-service requirements. Given that the future viability of the colleges is  under threat, the Minister of Education and the Minister for Employment and  Learning should be working together to maximise teacher-training opportunities  in the North.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: First, as to whether people can believe in change: as we speak,  change is happening, and people should be under no illusion that it will  continue &mdash; not changing is not an option. I look forward to working with  everyone in order to bring about that change.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, I answered a question about teacher-training  colleges earlier. I met Reg Empey, and we have agreed numbers for St Mary&rsquo;s University College,  Stranmillis University College  and other colleges, and, in due course, I will bring those forward. On a couple  of occasions, I met with people from St Mary&rsquo;s, and I will have further  discussions with them and with those in Stranmillis University   College about making  progress. Having visited both institutions on several occasions, I envisage  them playing an important role in teacher training and in other areas. I also  welcome the fact that Reg Empey has had discussions with both colleges, and I  welcome his comments yesterday. Therefore, talking about threats to viability  is not relevant to the issue.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council &mdash; Health and Food  Safety Sectoral Meeting</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety that he wishes make a statement regarding the  North/South Ministerial Council health and food safety sectoral meeting.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I will make a  statement on the seventh North/South Ministerial Council meeting in the health  and food safety sectoral format, which took place at Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast  on Wednesday 28 May 2008. The Executive were represented by myself as Minister  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and Michelle Gildernew, MP, MLA,  the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development. This statement has been  endorsed by Minister Gildernew. The Irish Government were represented by Mary  Harney TD, Minister for Health and Children, and Mary Wallace TD, the Minister  of State responsible for health promotion and food safety.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I chaired the meeting, which opened with a progress report  on a number of areas of co-operation in the health sector. Those areas  included: the initial findings of the pilot studies into cross-border co-operation  on GP out-of-hours provision; the continuing work on paediatric and congenital  cardiac services; the second major cross-border emergency-planning exercise,  which was held in April; the formal cross-border arrangement whereby  fire-and-rescue appliances now respond jointly to incidents on the new road  link between Newry and Dundalk; developments regarding the location of a  satellite radiotherapy centre at Altnagelvin Hospital; and developments on  cancer research.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Following the reorganisation and reform programmes for  health and social services in both jurisdictions, Ministers noted and welcomed  the update on the joint feasibility study, which will consider options and  opportunities for greater co-operation in the sphere of health and social care.  We look forward to examining the report in detail when it is completed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers received a presentation from Dr Jane Wilde, the  chief executive of the Institute of Public Health in Ireland. We congratulated the  institute on its achievements over the past decade, which complement and inform  public health in both jurisdictions. Furthermore, we noted its plans to focus  on research on estimates and forecasts for common chronic conditions, on a  review of policy and practice approaches to young men, and on health inequalities.  The council also welcomed the broad range of co-operation and health promotion  currently under way. It requested that officials bring to a future North/South  Ministerial Council meeting a planned programme for mutually beneficial joint  activities to promote public health and to tackle health inequalities, with  input, as appropriate, from other health-promotion and public-health  organisations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers welcomed the broad range of co-operation on  suicide prevention and endorsed proposals for planned future co-operation in  areas such as the all-island evaluation of the applied suicide intervention  skills training (ASIST), the development of performance indicators relating to  the all-island action plan, the production of an annual report on the all-island  plan to be tabled annually at the NSMC; and the development of phase three of  the all-island Promoting Mental Health public-awareness campaign.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We noted and welcomed the establishment of a co-ordinating  group, led by senior officials in the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety (DHSSPS) and the Department of Health and Children (DOHC), and  the development of a work programme to intensify co-operation on child  protection, in accordance with the NSMC plenary decision of 7 February 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers welcomed plans to develop a cross-border  awareness-raising campaign to address problems associated with the internet and  social networking, and the production of generic cross-border information on  issues such as the reporting of abuse, safe parenting and good employment  practice, while recognising the separate legislative and structural  arrangements. The council also welcomed the ongoing co-operation on  cross-border monitoring and management of sex offenders.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers discussed the legislative measures being introduced  in the UK  to improve further the safeguarding of children and vulnerable adults. I  advised Minister Harney that there would be a significant strengthening of  those arrangements if similar legislative arrangements could be introduced in  the Republic of Ireland. Since the NSMC meeting, my  officials have met their counterparts in the Republic of Ireland  and have agreed a number of actions, including the establishment of a subgroup  that will focus specifically on cross-border issues around vetting and barring.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers welcomed the appointment of the new advisory  board for Safefood, including the chairperson, Mr John Dardis, who attended the  meeting with Martin Higgins, the chief executive.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We received a report updating the Council on the activities  that Safefood has undertaken since the previous meeting, including the  appointment of experts to advise on Safefood&rsquo;s proposals for an enteric  reference library. We also noted the ongoing scientific and promotional  activities of Safefood, including: preliminary discussions with the Food  Standards Agency in London with regard to sharing scientific information; the  launch of new research projects, including those on infectious intestinal  disease in the community and the completion of the gastroenteritis research  project; the extension of the allergy awareness programme; the food hygiene  awareness campaign; and the ongoing partnership work with other bodies and  agencies that was highlighted in particular by the award of &ldquo;best in show&rdquo;  stand at this year&rsquo;s Balmoral Show.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers welcomed the establishment for three years of the  all-island obesity action forum, noted the development of a range of  communications initiatives in selected settings, including the workplace and  educational settings, and noted work to build a new evidence base from a range  of sources, including academia, research and action, and surveillance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council agreed to hold its next meeting in the health  and food safety sectoral format in October/November 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Health,  Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs <strong>O&rsquo;Neill)</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement, and I note that one of the areas to which he referred was suicide  prevention. A recommendation in the Committee&rsquo;s recent inquiry called on the  Minister to establish a designated suicide-prevention directorate that is along  similar lines to that which exists in the South of Ireland. The Committee  believed that such a team would provide a direct, central contact point for all  stakeholders.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Minister were serious about acting on that  particular recommendation, he would have talked about it at the meeting under  discussion. Will the Minister say whether he discussed the issue? If not, why  not? Furthermore, if he did not raise it at the previous meeting, will he  consider raising it at the next?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am not clear at which meeting  I was expected to discuss the matter. I went to the Health Committee, but the  Member is aware that I got the report very late and did not have an opportunity  to prepare a definitive response. I have, however, taken further steps in  regard to the Health Committee&rsquo;s report on suicide prevention. I called a  meeting of the joint ministerial group on suicide prevention yesterday, and it  has agreed its response to the Committee&rsquo;s report. That response will now go to  the Executive. In doing that, I have done what the Committee asked me to do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, at my previous meeting with the Committee I  indicated that the establishment of a suicide-prevention directorate is a  sensible idea. I am familiar with such organisations, given that something  similar was established in the Irish   Republic as part of the  work that was done there on suicide prevention. Indeed, that recommendation is  in the inter-ministerial group&rsquo;s joint report that will go to the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  The Minister referred to a joint feasibility study to consider options and  opportunities in the spheres of health and social care, with a completed report  due in the future. What is the total cost of that study, when is the final  report is due, and how much is it costing the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I thank the Minister for his statement. I note that the issue of  legislative measures for child protection was discussed, and I welcome the  Minister&rsquo;s commitment to strengthen arrangements in that area. Will the Minister  continue to press Minister Harney and her colleagues in the Irish Government to  address the issue immediately so that there is no disparity between both  jurisdictions on such an important matter?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Safeguarding children and  vulnerable adults is an important matter. In the UK, new legislative arrangements  are being introduced, which will greatly strengthen measures for safeguarding  children and vulnerable adults. Furthermore, a subgroup will be established in Northern Ireland  to focus on safeguarding and vetting procedures. It will be a shared regime for  the entire UK &mdash; that is, England, Scotland,  Wales and Northern Ireland.  However, we have a land border, and families routinely move across it. Therefore,  it would be helpful if the Irish   Republic were prepared to  share its intelligence on individuals who pose a risk to children and  vulnerable adults. I made that point at the previous sectoral meeting, and we  have now established a group to progress work on vetting and barring  procedures. However, the provision of mirrored legislation in the Irish Republic  is a matter for the Irish   Republic&rsquo;s Government,  but it will require a constitutional amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and acknowledge his sincerity. However, I  wonder whether we are making significant progress to address serious health  issues that impact on people as a direct result of partition. Does the Minister  agree that, after 10 years, we should be well beyond discussions, pilot and  feasibility studies, as well as reports that have yet to be published? Is the  Minister concerned that no date has been set for the next sectoral meeting, and  that it may not take place until October or November?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The sector meets biannually,  and, diaries permitting, the next sectoral meeting will be held in October or  November. I cannot give the precise date, but two meetings a year is  acceptable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Each new project or action point routinely requires a  feasibility study to evaluate what we are doing. That is sensible government,  and it ensures value for money. The overriding principle is mutual benefit. My  responsibility is to the people of Northern   Ireland, and Mary Harney&rsquo;s responsibility is to the  people of the Irish   Republic. However, we  both consider areas where joint actions would provide mutual benefit.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Progress has been made, considering that the bodies did not  sit and did not work, because the House did not sit and did not work. During  the past 10 years, the bodies met for two and a half years, which was followed  by a long hiatus. However, we have been up and running for one year now, and  progress has been made and will continue to be made. I am considering how we  measure that progress.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. We should all welcome and congratulate  Dr Jane Wilde for her health promotion work throughout Ireland.  However, the joint communiqu&eacute; states that the Institute of Public Health  plans to review policy and practice approaches to young men and alcohol and  health inequalities. Have young women been deliberately left out of that  review, because, as I understand it, the problem is as prevalent among young  women?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to common chronic conditions, was any mention  made about the further promotion of easy access to tobacco products in the  South of Ireland, as we are currently considering putting tobacco products out  of the sight of young people so that they do not start to smoke in the first  place?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I share Mr McCarthy&rsquo;s views  about Jane Wilde&rsquo;s work. The Institute  of Public Health in Ireland carries  out a great deal of research that informs jurisdictions North and South. The  institute has focused on young men and alcohol, which is a major problem with a  range of impacts in areas such as physical health and suicide. However, that  does not mean that we are ignoring, or excluding, young women &mdash; far from it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are also examining common chronic conditions. Members  will be aware that I launched the cardiovascular framework last week and  announced my strategy to enhance stroke services the week before. We are  working constantly on those issues in Belfast,  and the same applies in Dublin.  I have had discussions about those matters with the Dublin Government to  determine areas of mutual benefit, just as I do in regular meetings with  Government officials in London, Edinburgh  and Cardiff.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Tobacco is an important issue because of the incidence of  cancer. After cardiovascular disease, strokes and heart attacks, cancer is the  big killer in Northern    Ireland, and tobacco plays a large part in  that. Combating the use of tobacco is one of the key features of our strategies  to tackle cancer, and the same applies in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  I apologise for missing the beginning of the Minister&rsquo;s statement, which I  welcome.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s inquiry on suicide and self-harm  highlighted the model used in the Republic of Ireland, which is now funded by  the Irish Government; namely, Pieta House, which is a community home that is  open to all persons suffering issues around suicidal tendencies and self-harm.  Did the Minister have an opportunity to talk to his counterpart Mary Harney  about setting up a similar project in Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is keen to see that type of model introduced  in Northern Ireland.  The lack of provision for those young people who present themselves at accident  and emergency departments means that they sometimes go away having received  little or no help. That is not a criticism of the hospitals; they do not have  the resources to deal with such issues. Will the Minister tease out those  matters for us?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The idea of a community house  for the prevention of suicide and self-harm offers promise, and I am aware that  the Committee highlighted that in its report. The Committee also made proposals  about a safe room in accident and emergency departments and a visiting card  system, which is an excellent idea. As I said in my answer to Michelle O&rsquo;Neill,  the joint ministerial group yesterday agreed a joined-up approach for the  Executive on the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations. That will be my next step.  Following that, my Department will put appropriate measures in place, such as  the ones that we have discussed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. Will he inform the House whether he  raised the issue of the job imbalance in the Food Safety Promotion Board  (FSPB)? The vast majority of jobs in that agency are based in the Republic of Ireland,  and Northern Ireland  does not have its fair share. Did he also raise the issue of any efficiency  savings that he intends to make from the FSPB?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The budget for the FSPB is &pound;2  million per annum. As the Member is aware, I am required to make efficiency  savings across all areas of my budget, and I will look to do that.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As for job imbalance, we inherited the existing arrangement  of the cross-border bodies, such as the FSPB having its headquarters in Cork. However, there are  swings and roundabouts when one considers the overall spread of jobs across Departments.  I agree with the Member that the FSPB is concentrated in Cork  and Dublin.  However, the Food Standards Agency is based in Belfast. That Government body, which is  independent of the Department of Health, does a similar job to that of the  FSPB, so there are issues about overlap. Food safety is not ignored in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that cross-border bodies exist for mutual benefit, it  is worth pointing out that the FSPB has offices in Cork and Dublin &mdash; although I  have yet to visit either of them &mdash; but none in Belfast. However, that is not a  priority right now.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I concur with Mr Dallat. Although good work is being done in the food safety  and health sector of the North/South Ministerial Council, there is a need for a  gear shift. The Minister referred to:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the joint feasibility study, which will consider  options and opportunities for greater co-operation in the sphere of health and  social care&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That crucial work should be measured over the  coming decades, not only over the next few years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When will that crucial feasibility report be available, and  when will its recommendations be put into action? Can the Minister assure the  House that that work, in which he is involved and which is so crucial to the  welfare of the citizens of this island, will not be held up &mdash; even by one day &mdash;  by the St Andrews-concocted review of North/South bodies, the content of which  is not yet known?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I anticipate having that report  in my hands this summer. I will examine it carefully, because, as I said, it is  a piece of work that I inherited.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The St Andrews Agreement made provision for a review of  existing North/South bodies and possible areas of future co-operation. The work  on the feasibility report has carried on, and no obstacles have been put in its  way. The overriding principle is one of mutual benefit. My responsibility is to  the people of Northern    Ireland, but, if there are areas in which  the two jurisdictions can co-operate for mutual benefit, I will subscribe to  doing so. No obstacles will be placed in the way as far as that is concerned.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister provide an  update about cross-border co-operation on GP out-of-hours provision in Strabane  and Lifford? There are concerns about what is happening in Strabane. Has he had  any specific discussions about those areas? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: There are two pilot cross-border  out-of-hours GP schemes. One serves Londonderry  and Donegal and the other serves Keady and Castleblayney. Those services are  operating, and we await the outcome of their evaluation by the Centre for Cross  Border Studies. We will examine that evaluation, and it will inform any  decision that my Department will make about the future organisation of such  services. However, the information that I have suggests that the uptake of  those services was very low.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, especially his reference to the Republic of Ireland&rsquo;s policy on young people and  alcohol.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Is there an opportunity for the two Administrations to  build co-operation against the common enemy of alcohol abuse? We must examine  our attitudes to alcohol and the example that we set for our children. We must  also support and welcome the strong statement made by the Chief Medical Officer  yesterday.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Substantive measures have been introduced to tackle  smoking. Therefore, alcohol abuse is now the biggest public-health challenge  that we face. I hope that there will be an opportunity for the Minister &mdash;  perhaps at the next meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council &mdash; to put the  matter high on his agenda.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I entirely agree with the  sentiments expressed by Mrs Hanna. Alcohol abuse among young people is the  major challenge facing our society, as it is in the Irish  Republic, Scotland,  Wales and England. I am  examining the attendant mental- and physical-health problems and antisocial  behaviour. We have a new strategic policy on drug and alcohol abuse and a  policy to tackle binge drinking. In September 2008, I hope to outline other  steps that can be taken. Scotland  offers a good model for us and the Irish   Republic to follow. The  matter concerns both me and my Dublin  counterpart. It is a common problem and shared solutions can provide the  greatest benefit.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That concludes questions to the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety on the ministerial statement.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="5"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">June Monitoring Outcome</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Notice has been received from the Minister of Finance and  Personnel that he wishes to make a statement regarding the June monitoring  outcome.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr Dodds)</strong>: With permission, I will make a statement  regarding the Executive&rsquo;s decisions on the June monitoring round. This is the  first monitoring round of the 2008-09 financial year. Members will be aware by  now that the role and purpose of the in-year process is to help the Executive  make the most of the resources at our disposal by reviewing departmental  expenditure plans in light of the most recent information and emerging  pressures.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In recent months, a substantial and unprecedented pressure  has come in the form of the Civil Service equal-pay claim, which was initially  brought to the Assembly&rsquo;s attention by the then Minister of Finance and  Personnel, Peter Robinson. At its meeting on 19 June 2008, the Executive agreed  their approach to dealing with that pressure. In particular, Departments raised  a number of spending pressures. The scale of the potential equal-pay liability  and the potential impact on the delivery of public services means that the  matter must be resolved before any significant allocations can be made to Departments.  I will say more shortly on how we are seeking to deal with the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now provide some context to the opening financial  position for the 2008-09 in-year monitoring process, reflecting the decisions  taken unanimously by the Executive in the course of the recent Budget for  2008-09 to 2010-11, which were subsequently agreed by the Assembly in January  of this year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In recent years, as Members will be aware, spending plans  for public services here included an approach of overcommitting &mdash; that is,  allocating more than is available &mdash; in recognition that the normal level of  year underspend will ensure that total spending is contained within the  Treasury control totals. However, unlike the previous direct rule  Administration, the Executive firmly believe that there must be a sense of  balance to that approach. Thus, the starting position for current expenditure  this year, as set out in the recent Budget, is an overcommitment of &pound;100  million, with further reductions to &pound;80 million and &pound;60 million planned in the  next two years. That compares with the figure of over &pound;150 million inherited by  the Executive in May 2007. That approach was designed to strike a much better  balance between maximising allocation in the Budget process and retaining a  sufficient degree of flexibility in the course of the in-year process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the Budget included specific dispensation for  the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety so that it would  not be required to declare reduced requirements as part of in-year monitoring,  as well as having a prior call on the first &pound;20 million of available resources  throughout the year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget also pre-allocated &pound;102 million of the &pound;125  million in access to our current expenditure end-year flexibility stock for  2008-09, although &pound;100 million of capital end-year flexibility stock is  available to the Executive for allocation in the 2008-09 in-year process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those decisions, based on the information that was  available at that time, provided a robust basis for the management of the  financial position, and the associated delivery of public services, in this  financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the first stage of each monitoring round for the 2008-09  in-year process, Departments identify resources that were allocated in previous  Budget processes, which, for a variety of reasons, will not be spent in this  financial year. Reduced requirements that Departments declared in this  monitoring round amounted to &pound;15&middot;2 million of current expenditure and &pound;21&middot;3  million of capital investment. A further &pound;5&middot;9 million in room-to-manoeuvre for  current expenditure is available to the Executive, most of which arose from the  Barnett consequentials for Northern Ireland as a result of the Chancellor of  the Exchequer&rsquo;s 2008 Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The level of reduced requirements is similar to that  declared in last June&rsquo;s monitoring round, after which Departments declared  significant amounts of reduced requirements later in the year, when,  unfortunately, it was too late to redeploy the funding to other services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the legislative stages of the Budget (No. 2) Bill,  many Members mentioned areas for which they sought additional funding, and I  suspect that that will be the case again today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Departments have also identified more than &pound;140 million in  current expenditure pressures in their June monitoring returns. That includes a  bid from the Minister of Education for the extended schools programme. Although  there is scope for the Minister of Education to reprioritise the considerable  resources that are already available to her, the invaluable services that are  provided to children and their families from the extended schools programme are  too important for the Executive not to act. I, therefore, assure Members that  every effort will be made to provide additional funding for that programme at  the next monitoring round.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, allocations cannot be made to tackle pressures if  Departments do not declare reduced requirements early enough in the year.  Details of the reduced requirements that Departments declared are set out in my  statement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Civil Service equal-pay claim, which has a potential  one-off cost of well over &pound;100 million &mdash; with further costs, depending on the  approach that the Executive adopt &mdash; will have to be resolved. The liability  relates to junior members of staff who work in general service grades in the  Civil Service, whose work was evaluated as being broadly equivalent to a number  of technical grades but whose salaries were lower.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The pressure has arisen as a consequence of the handling of  pay issues for the relevant staff over the past 10 years. Hence, the national  Government have responsibility for the situation, and that should be reflected  in how the pressure is dealt with. In that context, my officials have been  engaged with their Treasury counterparts on the matter, and I have written to  the Chief Secretary to the Treasury to seek an urgent meeting with her to find  an equitable solution to the problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Pending the outcome of those discussions with the Treasury,  the Executive agreed that it would be imprudent to make any significant  reallocations now. However, minor issues that were identified in the Budget  process required specific in-year consideration. Although most of the 2008-09  access to the Executive&rsquo;s current expenditure end-year flexibility was  allocated as part of the Budget process, &pound;23 million remained for allocation to  Departments. In the light of the constrained position on access to end-year  flexibility, and reflecting the circumstances that applied to the funding of  schools through the local management of schools mechanism, the Executive agreed  that &pound;16 million be allocated to the Department of Education. Furthermore, &pound;7&middot;7  million in current expenditure and &pound;12&middot;7 million in capital investment is  required to cover previous commitments to projects funded from the integrated  development fund.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, the Budget included provision for the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to have a prior call on  resources that become available during the year, once the overcommitment  position has been addressed. The equal-pay pressure and low level of reduced  requirements means that insufficient resources are available for any funding  from the first call to be allocated. However, in recognition of the importance  of implementing developments in the Health Service, the Executive have agreed  to make an allocation of &pound;5 million.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland Departments have plans in place for &pound;1&middot;8  billion of capital investment this year, of which &pound;550 million is to be derived  from capital receipts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the majority of those receipts were expected to  come from the disposal of surplus assets, Members will be aware of the downturn  in the local property market reflecting the trend across the United Kingdom.  Although those softer market conditions should reduce the cost of delivering  the Executive&rsquo;s investment programme, the impact on capital receipts needs to  be fully considered.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Estimates provided by Departments for the current financial  year suggest that there may be a shortfall of &pound;140 million in the level of  capital receipts originally planned for. Departments have identified bids to  address pressures and improve services to the value of &pound;109 million. However,  in light of the shortfall in capital receipts and the potential for capital  expenditure to provide some solution to the equal pay issue, the Executive have  agreed to defer action on capital reallocations until the engagement with the  Treasury has run its course. In the meantime Departments will continue to  maximise the level of receipt from planned asset disposals as well as identify  alternative disposal options.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The level of planned overcommitment for current expenditure  sits at &pound;85&#903;1 million, as a consequence of the level of reduced requirements  and the outstanding issues from the Budget, and we have unallocated resources  of &pound;105&#903;9 million for capital investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Without doubt, public service provision in Northern Ireland  is facing the most challenging in-year position ever. The circumstances mean  that we face a potentially difficult engagement with the Treasury followed by  hard choices later in the financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To ensure that we do not act precipitously and that all  recommendations on the way forward reflect the position reached with the  Treasury, the Executive have agreed that we adopt a two-stage approach. That  approach will involve the resolution of minor issues left over from the budget  process and the more substantive matter of handling the full implications of  the equal pay claim &mdash; which will be considered after discussions with the Treasury  have been concluded.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I emphasise to Members that the position set out  today represents the best-case outcome. Should discussions with the Treasury  deliver a resolution on the equal pay claim then there will be no further  changes to the in-year position until the September monitoring round. In the  event that we do not make the progress that we hope for, we will then face  significant and difficult choices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The implications for public services regarding negotiations  with the unions on the way forward in respect of the equal pay claim are  fundamental. We all agree that there should be an equitable treatment for  staff, and the Executive recognises the obligation on the trade unions to  ensure that legal entitlements are met. However, the trade union movement needs  to recognise the potentially devastating impact that the resolution of the  equal pay claim could have on the provision of public services and on those  public-sector workers that the unions have sought to defend in the past.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Within the context of the fixed budget that is available to  the Executive, there is a necessary trade-off between cost and volume: to put  it starkly; increased pay costs inevitably place significant constraints on  staffing levels and pay rises across the public sector &mdash; that is a situation  that we would all wish to avoid.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I recognise that the equal pay legacy that  we have inherited from direct rule Ministers provides an unwelcome backdrop to  the in-year monitoring process, particularly when Departments are facing real  pressures in the delivery of services. However, the true test of any Government  is not how they operate when times are good but how they respond in times of  adversity. With the continued support of all parties in the Executive and the  Assembly I have no doubt that this Government will pass that test; I commend  the June monitoring position to the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McLaughlin)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and his  realistic and objective assessment of the external and internal pressures that  are emerging. Although the external pressures are beyond the direct control of  the Executive, some pressures do pose questions as to how the Departments will deal  with them. Given the potential implication on the Executive&rsquo;s resources from  the inherited equal pay claim &mdash; which the Minister has addressed &mdash; what is the  timeline for concluding discussions with the Treasury and finding a resolution  to that issue?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister referred to the fact that the level of reduced  requirements is similar to that which was declared in the June monitoring round  last year: that indicates a lack of performance in financial management.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The provisional out-turn for 2007-08 shows that there has  been an underspend of &pound;177 million in current expenditure and &pound;76 million in  capital. Again, we are seeing the usual rush as Departments try to spend their  money in one month at the end of the year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister see a risk of a similar pattern  developing in 2008-09, with Departments not declaring reduced requirements  early enough in the year to enable sensible reallocation to other priorities  and front-line services, and what measures is he taking to rectify the  situation?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Chairperson of the Committee for Finance  and Personnel for his comments and for his recognition of the circumstances  surrounding the in-year monitoring process. All parties in the Executive, and  no doubt in the House, recognise the circumstances that I have outlined &mdash;  particularly those concerning the equal pay claim. That is not only a legal  obligation; it must be addressed as an issue of fairness and equality. That  obligation must be met.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the timeline for engagement with the Treasury, I  wrote to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on 17 June, asking her for an  urgent meeting to draw her attention to the issues and to highlight the  potential impact on the delivery of public services. My officials have been  working with Treasury counterparts for a number of weeks on the technical  options for addressing the equal pay issue. There will be further engagement at  ministerial and official level over the next month or so to try to secure a  satisfactory outcome for Northern    Ireland. No stone will be left unturned in  our efforts to ensure Treasury recognition of the inherited legacy that we have  to grapple with on equal pay.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson also highlighted an important point about  reduced requirements. A relatively low amount of reduced requirements are being  declared at this stage in the financial year, as I have said in my statement.  The later in the year that reduced requirements are declared, and money handed  back to the Department of Finance and Personnel, the more difficult our  position becomes in reallocating that money. As a result, and inevitably,  public services across Northern    Ireland will not get the maximum output from  the resources available. Some Departments declare very significant underspends  at the end of the financial year, which then go into the end-year flexibility  process, and they are sums for which we have to bid from the Treasury. Wherever  possible, Departments should be looking rigorously at expenditure plans.  Potential underspends must be avoided, and money must be declared as early as  possible for reallocation to the same Department or to other Departments in due  course over the financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly must bear down on underspends strongly, and  Members of Committees have a significant role to play. During Question Time  yesterday, the role of the performance and efficiency delivery unit (PEDU) in  working with Departments to realise the maximum output and use of resources was  discussed. The issue is one that Members all have a responsibility to take very  seriously and monitor very carefully.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. During the Budget process, the Committee  sought assurances about funding for various Civil Service reform projects the  Department of Finance and Personnel is taking forward. The Committee sought  assurance that funding for those projects would be met out of this year&rsquo;s  monitoring rounds. We have seen bids by DFP for that. Will the Minister assure  us that those schemes will not be delayed in any way, given the efficiencies  that they will deliver for all of the Civil Service? Will he advise Members  about the level of access end-year flexibility stock, which he referred to as  being more constrained now than previously?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am grateful to the Deputy Chairman of the  Committee for his questions. He made the point that investment in the reform  programme can release many resources for front-line services. That programme is  therefore important, if the Executive and Assembly are to make progress.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my statement I made the case that, apart from the first  instalment of &pound;20 million to the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety, we are not in a position to make further allocations at this  stage. There is nothing new about that: in last June&rsquo;s monitoring round, no  allocations were made. However, we do not anticipate that there will be  significant delays in the implementation of that programme, and I will keep it under  review. As I said, when we have engaged with the Treasury, our position will be  much clearer and we will be able to return to those issues &mdash; not least the  reform programme to which the Deputy Chairman refers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As to end-year flexibility, the Member knows that all  available end-year flexibility has now been allocated to the Northern Ireland  Executive up to 2007-08. As a result of the underspend by Northern Ireland  Depart&shy;ments in 2007-08, our end-year flexibility stock has been increased by  &pound;200 million of current expenditure. As I have said, I will shortly open  negotiations with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury in an effort to secure  access to those moneys.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  This report is worrying. The Minister&rsquo;s Budget is now in serious difficulty.  The two key issues are the equal pay issue, which is a one-off cost of &pound;100  million, and a possible writing-down of capital receipts by &pound;140 million.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have already placed a question for written answer to the  Minister on the equal pay issue. I now ask him what level of preparation was  made for this when the Budget was written. The issue cannot have come out of  the blue; what plan was made to deal with it? The equal pay issue will bear  differently upon different Departments, which have varying proportions of female  workers. It will be good if the Treasury comes through with a solution. If  there is a significant impact on the money available to Departments, will the Minister  assure us that he will fully protect Departments against the differential  effect?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: We recognise that some Departments are affected more  directly by equal pay than others &mdash; for instance, the Department for Employment  and Learning (DEL), the Department for Social Development (DSD) and others. It  makes no sense to insist that those Departments deal with the issue in  isolation. This matter is for the Executive and the Assembly as a whole.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is a legacy, or an inherited issue. What brings it to  a head is the possibility of legal action on this front, which arises this  year. My officials will work to clarify the precise level of liability in  relation to the equal pay claim. Work that has been done suggests that the  liability may amount to a figure in excess of &pound;100 million as a minimum.  However, we will not know conclusively until payments are calculated for each  individual member of staff. We will engage extensively with the Treasury on  this matter, because it has come to the Executive very late in the day. It has  arisen as a result of matters not being addressed during direct rule. It is  only right that we draw the entire position to the Assembly&rsquo;s attention. I am  sure that the Member will join with his party colleague in the Executive, and  other colleagues, in ensuring that we all put the best possible case to the  Treasury to address this issue, so that public services in Northern Ireland  are not significantly affected.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  take this, my first opportunity, to congratulate the Minister on his  appointment and welcome him to his post. I look forward to crossing swords with  him.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Regarding the commitment to grant the Health Service the  first &pound;20 million of any moneys released, does the Minister share my concern  that providing that through monitoring rounds, rather than through the Budget,  runs the risk of distorting the monitoring process? That is true in relation to  a range of services, not least to how the equal pay issue is handled.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for his welcome and I look  forward to &ldquo;crossing swords&rdquo;, as he puts it. However, I am sure that there will  be nothing to worry about in that respect.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The commitment for the first call of the &pound;20 million in  in-year monitoring was made in the last Budget and was agreed unanimously by  the Executive and by this Assembly. As a result, the Department is committed to  that process. I do not believe that it will not have the major distorting  effect envisaged by the Member, as there is recognition in the Executive and  the Assembly of the priority afforded to the Health Service. Flexibility will  remain in the addressing of the other pressures as they emerge, following the  outcome of our discussions with the Treasury.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Minister has indicated that departmental officials have engaged with  Treasury officials regarding the &pound;100 million plus Civil Service equal pay  claim. He also indicated that he has written to the Chief Secretary to the  Treasury.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the scale of the funding required for that pay claim  and the other financial pressures &mdash; such as the reduced receipts from the sale  of assets &mdash; will the Minister advise when DFP became aware of the scale of that  matter, as it cannot just have appeared from nowhere? Furthermore, why has no  meeting occurred between Ministers of this Assembly and the Treasury to address  the gravity of the issue?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that that issue needs to be  resolved quickly, allowing better organisation of our own expenditure and  better value for money, through the potential release of funds in-year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Much of what the Member has asked has been covered  in my statement, and the answers that he requires are obvious to everyone.  However, on the question of the engagement, I have been in contact with the  Chief Secretary to the Treasury and my officials have been in contact with  Treasury officials. Therefore, my Department and I are well aware of the  gravity of the situation. I wrote to the Treasury on 17 June, and that communication  will be followed up urgently.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will know that the pay claim issue arose  following a statement from the previous Minister of Finance and Personnel. It  was agreed by everyone that there was a legal and moral obligation to those  civil servants who had been underpaid for so long. It is an inherited, legacy  issue; however, it falls to the Assembly to deal with it this year. We will  strongly press the Treasury to provide the flexibility required to address the  pay claim without having any adverse impact on public services.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  Given the track record of the Northern Ireland Departments with respect to  under&shy;spends, have the Executive considered an increase in the over-commitment  to meet the pressures now?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member again draws attention to a point made by  the Chairperson of the Committee, and one that I made in my statement &mdash; the  significant level of underspend still occurring each year in Northern Ireland  Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are various reasons for those underspends, but the  pressure must be maintained to declare any reduced requirements early enough to  ensure that those resources can be properly utilised in-year. As far as  over-commitment is concerned, we will keep that under review. However, I am  confident that the level of over-commitment outlined as a target for this and  future years is broadly correct.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I, too, congratulate the Member on  his promotion to Minister of Finance and Personnel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In order to enable Members to track the internal movements  of finance, will the Minister provide a detailed breakdown of reallocations in  each Department?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: That can be provided. Those figures are available as  part of the statement because, as part of the process, Departments announce  their reduced requirements and the Department of Finance and Personnel  announces in-year reallocations. There are also, as the Member said, many  internal reallocations made in each Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If those figures are not already with the statement, they  will be made available to Members as soon as possible. However, Departments  have considerable flexibility to reprioritise in their budgets. Members may  note that this year&rsquo;s monitoring exercise reflects a significant amount of  reallocation in some Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is good that that is happening early, because it means  that the money can be put to its best use by those Departments this year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I, too, take my first opportunity in the House to congratulate my colleague on  his appointment as Minister of Finance and Personnel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome what the Minister said in his statement about the  extended schools programme. It is disappointing, however, that the Education  Minister did not reprioritise her budget in order to provide the money needed  for the extended schools programme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister reassure the House that he sees the  matter as an education priority and that he will take part in any discussions  with the Department of Education that are necessary to ensure that the finance  is allocated?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for his best wishes and for his  question.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I highlighted in my statement the fact that the extended  schools programme provides a broad range of valuable services to communities,  which was mentioned earlier in the House. I explained why it would have been  imprudent for the Executive to allocate additional funding to any programme  until the broader financial context was clarified.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I indicated in my statement the priority that I  attach and will afford to that programme. The funding position is primarily a  matter for the Education Minister. In a budget of &pound;1&middot;8 billion, the bid of &pound;5  million that has been lodged is relatively small. In the context of last year&rsquo;s  underspend of &pound;50 million in revenue and &pound;36 million in capital, there seems to  be very little risk of that being carried forward in the Department of  Education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have listened carefully to the debate and to what Members  have said, and I will deal with the matter, because I know from my experience  and knowledge that extended schools is a very valuable programme. That is why I  indicated the priority that I will attach to it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am absolutely content that there are sufficient resources  available to the Department of Education to allow the extended schools  programme to continue until the funding has been confirmed; and I wish to  emphasise that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I, too, congratulate the Minister on his appointment. I welcome the commitment  that he reiterated in respect of extended schools, and I am mindful of his  comments about how the Department of Education manages the programme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s statement is very stark and honest;  particularly his comment that this is the most challenging in-year position  ever to face the public service and that there could be hard choices later in  the financial year. Against that backdrop and the general turbulence in the  markets, is the Minister likely to return to the House later in the year with a  supplementary Budget in relation to overall public expenditure in the North or  might he direct Departments to increase their savings because of the strain on  public funds?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alternatively, is it possible that, given the strain on  public funds, the Minister may direct Departments to increase savings later in  the year?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On a different matter, what position is the Department of  Finance and Personnel taking on the acquisition of Ministry of Defence sites at  Forkhill, Shackleton and Lisanelly?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his comments not  only about my new job but the extended schools programme. I hope that Members  have taken my words on board and are reassured by them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is absolutely right that we are open, transparent and  honest about the issue of the equal pay claim. It is a serious issue that must  be dealt with, and we will do so very forcefully with the Treasury in the  coming weeks. When that engagement with the Treasury is complete, I will report  back to the Executive and the Assembly. At this stage, I do not want to  speculate about what might happen thereafter. Our negotiations with the  Treasury will proceed urgently, and, with goodwill on all sides, we should be  able to come to an equitable arrangement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that this situation has arisen during the current  financial year is beyond our control; it was not planned, nor would we have  wished to have to deal with it in this way. Nevertheless, the issue must be  dealt with, and that will be a test for all of us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will consider the issue of the Ministry of Defence sites  and will get back to the Member.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement on the June monitoring round. He has informed the House of the  reduced requirements of various Departments. Given the concerns that the  Committee raised about regional investment disparities, particularly in areas  west of the Bann, the north-west, his constituency of North Belfast, and in West Belfast, will he explain why Invest NI has reduced  inward investment by approximately &pound;6 million?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am happy to provide the Member with information on  that issue, although his first port of call should be the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment, which will, undoubtedly, be able to provide  him with detailed information.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The only reason that any Department would announce a  reduction in its requirement is if it felt that it would be unable to spend the  money allocated to a particular project or programme during the current  financial year. That is not to say that, in the course of the year,  circumstances will not change; Departments may reallocate resources and make  funding bids.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Departments for recognising reduced  requirements early and making it clear that that money is available to the  centre for other needy projects and programmes. However, the Member should  contact the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment for an explanation  for particular cases of reduced requirements.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  Minister has highlighted the significance of the equal pay issue and the  potential impact that it will have. In his statement and in his answers to a range  of questions, he has also given a strong indication of the level of engagement  with the Treasury. During the Minister&rsquo;s discussions with the Treasury, will he  take advantage of the opportunity to raise the impact of cost-of-living issues,  particularly the detrimental impact that fuel prices are having in Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for his question, which raises an  important issue. Currently, many of our constituents are concerned about the  rising cost of living &mdash; particularly, the rise in fuel prices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said yesterday in the House, a fuel poverty task force  has been meeting through the Executive to address that issue. It has confirmed  that it will make representations to the Chancellor for an increase in the  winter fuel allowance, which I fully support, and will make other  representations as appropriate.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Fuel prices affect all parts of the country and, indeed,  all countries. Interestingly, recent AA reports show that the price of petrol  has increased by 16&middot;8% in Northern Ireland  in the past year compared with 17&middot;4% in the UK as a whole. Similarly, the 27&middot;3%  increase in the price of diesel in Northern   Ireland over the past year is slightly less than the  average UK  increase of 28&middot;3%. However, those are still substantial rises for consumers and  motorists. Rises in the cost of fuel affect us all and have a knock-on effect  on, for example, the cost of heating where both people&rsquo;s homes and departmental  budgets are concerned. Those issues will also be subject to in-year monitoring.  We will push HM Treasury on an individual and ministerial level on a range of  issues that affect the well-being and quality of life of all our citizens.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Why can the &pound;180 million underspend for 2007-08 not be used  to address the equal pay pressures? Given that over &pound;100 million is available  for allocation, why was it not possible to address any of the pressures that  were identified by Departments on capital projects?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for his best wishes and for his  questions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The underspend is added to the end-year flexibility stock.  As part of the financial package, we negotiated access to end-year flexibility  stock. Under HM Treasury rules, all UK Departments must negotiate access to  end-year flexibility stock in light of the UK fiscal position. Enhanced access  to end-year flexibility will be one of the options that is considered as part  of our discussions with HM Treasury.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my statement, I said that we had unallocated resources  on the capital side, but that, given the reduction in receipts, it was wise not  to make any decisions on allocation at this stage, because the amount of  capital money that is available may also be relevant to the settlement of the  equal pay claim.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that those matters are advanced, and  Departments are still responsible for addressing the shortfall in capital  receipts by identifying other surplus assets for disposal or by making  adjustments to their capital investment plans. However, once the equal pay  claim is resolved, some form of support will be considered for those  Departments that have taken every possible action to address the shortfall.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. In answer to a previous question,  the Minister said that we are part of a global economy, which is experiencing a  downturn. In addition, we have no control over our economic destiny, and that  situation does not assist our position either.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome two of the commitments that were given in the  June monitoring round: first, the additional money that is being invested in  health; and secondly, the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to extended schools. Although I  do not agree with all that the Minister said about extended schools, I will not  delay Members&rsquo; lunches by debating his remarks further.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that he is engaging closely with the  Treasury and its officials on the equal pay claim. Does he agree that close and  intense engagement is also required with the trade union movement, which is &mdash;  correctly &mdash; looking after its members, who have severely restricted budgets?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for his points. I welcome the  fact that he recognises that, in light of the constrained position in which we  find ourselves this year, the allocation to the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety and the commitment that I made to extended schools  are measures that he can support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have already talked about engagement with the Treasury.  Furthermore, of course there must be close engagement with the trade unions.  That has begun, and officials in my Department will continue to work with union  representatives to address the issue of back pay and how it can be progressed.  That will be important in resolving the matter. There will be an ongoing  year-on-year impact on pay, and that will depend on how the Executive decide to  address it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That concludes questions to the Minister of Finance and Personnel  on his statement on the June monitoring outcome.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Members have raised this issue in  recent months. I ask you and your colleagues in the Office of the Speaker to  consider, during the summer recess, how to address the continuing problem of  Ministers&rsquo; failure to answer questions in the House. Although the Minister of  Education is not the only offender, she has been the worst offender. I asked  her a question today that was not only not fully nor partially answered but was  not answered at all.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. How a Minister responds to a question is not the Office of  the Speaker&rsquo;s responsibility.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, if the Speaker or Deputy  Speakers can direct Members to ask questions of the Minister, is it not time to  introduce a provision that allows you to direct Ministers to answer those  questions?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is not a matter for the Office of the Speaker; it is a matter  for the Minister. I will take no more points of order on that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Business Committee has arranged to meet immediately on  the lunchtime suspension. I propose, therefore, by leave of the Assembly, to  suspend the sitting until 2.00 pm.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.52 pm.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the  Chair) &mdash;</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Budget (No. 2) Bill</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Final Stage</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr Dodds)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Budget (No. 2) Bill [NIA 18/07] do now pass.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As we reach the Final Stage of the Bill, I thank my  colleague the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment for so ably  introducing and moving the Second Stage of the Bill on 9 June and 10 June.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank again the Committee for Finance and Personnel for  agreeing to the accelerated passage of the Bill. Although accelerated passage  for any Bill is not the Assembly&rsquo;s preferred route, in this case, it is a  necessity for logistical reasons. It is imperative that the Bill is passed,  given that Departments are spending cash and using resources based on the Vote  on Account for 2008-09, which the Assembly passed in February 2008. It is  imperative that the Budget (No. 2) Bill progresses through the Assembly &mdash; and  receives Royal Assent &mdash; before the summer recess, otherwise Departments may run  out of cash and resources before the Assembly sits again in the autumn. I know  that the Committee for Finance and Personnel and the House fully appreciate the  consequences involved. The Bill will ensure that Departments have money to  spend in the coming months.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Debates have been interesting and constructive, and I thank  Members for their contributions. There are few more important duties in the  Assembly than authorising public expenditure by the Northern Ireland  Departments. Therefore, I am delighted at the level of interest in the debates  on the Supply Resolutions and the Second Stage of the Bill a couple of weeks  ago.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Bill to the House, and I hope that it will  receive the support of Members.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McLaughlin)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. As the Minister acknowledged, the Committee was  heavily involved in the Budget process, which is encapsulated in the Bill. It  is fully aware of the consequences for departmental spending and the potential  effect on front-line services should the Bill not progress through the Assembly  before summer recess. The Committee was content that it had been adequately  consulted and that the Bill could proceed by accelerated passage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is also aware that, from this autumn, the  Executive intend to put in place a new Budget process for future years. It has,  therefore, agreed to undertake an inquiry into the Budget process and scrutiny  to inform the Executive&rsquo;s deliberations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Committee for Finance and Personnel, I  support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Members of the House will remember that the SDLP expressed serious concerns  about, and opposition to, the Budget. We voted against the Budget and the  Programme for Government when those were debated. At that time, we were  dismissed by some as if it were a political stunt; they might think otherwise  today. Many of the fears that we expressed have proven to be valid; they have  become a reality sooner than, perhaps, even we had expected.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to refer to a number of issues, the first of which  is children and young people and the funding for services related to those groups.  My party regretted the removal of Executive programme funds and, in particular,  a cross-cutting fund for children and young people. Others said that the money  should go to the Departments where it would be better used, and thereby reduce  underspend. We asked how that joined-up approach would be achieved and how  several Departments would contribute funding to a single project or a concerted  approach. We were told not to worry about that. We were told that the public  service agreements would define the objective, state which Departments would be  involved, and specify a lead Department. We were assured that all the energies  and resources of those Departments would be harnessed together to produce the  desired outcome.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We were told that all would be well, but the outcome was  very different.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will refer to three strands of activity in relation to  children and young people. First, the Youth Service &mdash; which is an important and  difficult area of social provision that was debated deeply here &mdash; experienced  significant budget cuts. It was not adequately funded.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I stress how important such social spending is &mdash; investment  in our young people pays real dividends. We would have fewer social problems if  money was put into education or into social provision for young people. In  addition, those young people will make a much greater contribution as they  enter into adulthood.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, there has been a crisis in the much-needed  programme of extended schools. It seems that the Minister concerned did not  give that issue sufficient priority and did not provide the necessary funding.  This morning, in his statement on the June monitoring outcome, the Minister of  Finance and Personnel made it clear that, due to the importance of the extended  schools programme, the Executive would have to provide a rescue plan. I welcome  the proposed rescue plan because it is clear that it is needed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, a huge crisis emerged with school-age childcare,  much of which is provided by the community and voluntary sectors. The Minister  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety provided a temporary rescue by  putting funding into that area &mdash; but that will last only until December 2008.  An attempt has now been made to fix that situation; I think that that is led by  the Health Minister, although I am not certain. It is a cross-departmental  attempt at a remedy by bringing together the resources of several Departments.  Essentially, we are establishing a cross-departmental fund &mdash; something that we  were told was not needed in the first place.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another aspect of education is the reorganisation of  secondary schools. Everyone in the House is aware of the shocking lack of  clarity concerning our direction of travel on that matter. I talk to educators  and I can report &mdash; as other Members can &mdash; that they have deep concerns about  the future nature of our secondary school system. Not only are we unaware of  the direction of travel and what the outcome will be; the system is not  budgeted for. The Minister did not put the money in place to deliver that  radical restructuring and change.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In his statement this morning, the Finance Minister spoke  at length about equal pay; it was one of the biggest elements of his statement.  As a one-off requirement, the Minister told us that it could cost &pound;100 million,  which he described as a legacy from direct rule; however, it cannot have come  as a bolt from the blue. At the time of the discussions, one hopes that the  then Minister, the present Minister and their colleagues were well informed  that that issue was coming down the line.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I asked the Minister a question about that issue this  morning and told him that I had submitted a question for written answer. With  respect to the Minister, he did not give me an answer this morning, so I repeat  the question: what preparation was made for that issue as the Budget was being  drafted? What knowledge did the Department have about the issue and what  preparation was made? The House is entitled to know.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A big element of the Budget depends on property sales, to  which the Minister referred this morning. He revealed that, even in this  financial year, there may be a reduction of &pound;140 million in the anticipated  gains from property sales. Although I try to follow these matters closely, I  find myself confused, so I urge the Minister to provide more facts. I read the  capital realisation task force document and saw a reference to potential gains  of &pound;295 million over three years. The Minister informed me that gains could be  reduced to &pound;140 million in this year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I would like clarity on that from the Minister: if he can  give it today, well and good; if not, I ask him to write to me. If he is not  prepared to do either, will he please let me know so that I can ask him a  question for written answer? I want to know the anticipated needs to meet this  year&rsquo;s Budget as it was written; how much is anticipated over the three-year  period; and the re-estimates of those figures.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the property sales discussion, I refer to  Workplace 2010 &mdash; which is a big element of property sales. Several question  marks appear over Workplace 2010, but we also know that there is a major new  issue with it that the House should be aware of. There are two residual bidders  for the Workplace 2010 tender process &mdash; Land Securities Trillium, and Telereal.  We know that Land Securities Trillium is minded to divest itself of the  Trillium element of its business, and we know that one of the bidders for that  element is Telereal. The clear link between those two companies could remove  the necessary competitive tension as the tender is decided. I have no doubt  that the Minister is aware of the issue and that his officials are taking it  seriously. However, the potential to wreck the entire process exists and we  must be aware that it is a significant risk to the delivery of the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If we add the two headline figures that the Minister quoted  this morning &mdash; the equal pay figure of &pound;100 million, and &pound;140 million of  potential losses in this year on property sales and a potential reduction in  gains &mdash; we have a potential &pound;240 million hole in this year&rsquo;s Budget. Such an  amount of money could make a serious difference to departmental budgets.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am all for efficiency savings when they are related to  the reallocation of resources in Departments to better ends. However, it does  not always work out as it should. There is evidence in certain sections &mdash; and  health is included, although it is not unique to health &mdash; where the mechanism  for achieving those savings is to have a no-replacement-of-staff policy. A  no-replacement-of-staff policy means cuts in a section. If a member of staff  leaves and they are not replaced, that service cannot be provided to the  public. Cuts are happening as a result of efficiency savings.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have presented a considerable list of concerns. I will  not be at all surprised if the Minister brings a revised Budget to the House at  some stage this year. Everything that I have said indicates that a considerably  different Budget ought to have been proposed at the outset, because risks were  visible then. I express my concerns, and the SDLP will oppose the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Today&rsquo;s debate is the end of a long process in determining the Budget for the  current financial year. The Alliance Party has, on many occasions, recorded it  opposition to what is a flawed Budget. However, we are not minded to divide the  House today, although I appreciate that others may do so. The Alliance Party  has placed on record its concerns and sought to divide the House to make its  point, so we do not need to repeat the exercise and detain the Minister any  further. However, we will see what happens.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Today is an opportunity to look forward. The Budget Bill  will be passed, based on the voting system in the Chamber. However, it has  lukewarm support &mdash; with the exception of the DUP, which has controlled the process  from day one. The other parties in the Executive, to varying degrees, seem to  express reservations. Even some Back Bench Members from the DUP have expressed  reservations on occasion.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of issues need to be flagged up for consideration  in future budgetary processes, and I want to highlight several structural  issues, which carry direct economic and financial costs to Northern Ireland.  They also carry major opportunity costs due our not being able to spend money  on the things that we wanted to do. We also need to appreciate that the savings  will allow us to invest in new policies, practices and services and reflect new  investments that are being made not just in other parts of these islands but  elsewhere in the world.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I would disappoint Mr Hamilton, in particular, if I did not  mention the cost of division. That must be central in handling public  expenditure in Northern    Ireland in the future. My party is committed  to providing DFP with a paper on the issue before the beginning of the summer  recess. However, rather than rehearsing the direct financial implications, I  stress that the issue is wider than the direct financing of services in Northern Ireland.  It has to be about the appreciation of how divisions distort the way in which  people live, learn, work and play in Northern Ireland, and, as a consequence,  the way in which public services respond to the sad realities on the ground.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will highlight three potential issues. The first is  labour mobility, the second is foreign and domestic decisions on investment,  and the third is spatial planning. There are many more issues, but I will deal  with those three today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I echo Mr O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s point about efficiency savings. I have  no difficulty with efficiency savings, and I accept the departmental target of  3%. If anything, I recognise that 3% is perhaps the minimum, and that more  ambitious targets may be possible as Northern Ireland public expenditure  is restructured. Savings greater than 3% are routinely required from managers  in the private sector. Therefore, they are possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, there is an extremely fine line between genuine  efficiency savings and cuts. The message coming back from the community, and in  particular the health sector, as it wrestles with efficiency savings, is that  the savings are in fact cuts. Efficiency savings should be about shifting  resources from old practices and policies that have become redundant as time  has moved on or results have been achieved. Those resources should be freed up  and reinvested to meet other priorities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are also major structural issues in relation to  education, which is one sector that I want to highlight, in which a  disproportionate amount of the budget is spent on school buildings, at the  expense of genuine investment in pupils. In Northern Ireland, there is the  bizarre situation in which there is one of the highest levels of spending per  capita on education as a whole and a relatively low amount being spent on  pupils.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Integrated education is the most sustainable way forward,  but it is not being actively encouraged by the Executive at the moment. It must  be seen as a preferred option, within a range of approaches towards shared  schools that are also of merit and should be considered. The issue should not  be about investment in new buildings, it can also be about transformation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The health budget is barely sufficient for the Department  to maintain basic service provision. In Northern   Ireland, spending on health is falling behind that in the  rest of the United Kingdom  despite the record levels of investment referred to by the Finance Minister&rsquo;s  predecessor on a regular basis. Sadly, in Northern Ireland, there is a much  higher level of need than elsewhere. By 2011, spending on health will be about  &pound;200 million short of the level that it needs to be. Members can talk about  efficiency savings in the health sector, but that is not about trying to do the  same with less.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Efficiancy savings must be used to free up resources in  order that the delivery of health services in Northern Ireland can be  restructured.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the Chamber, many Members have discussed mental-health  issues. However, only 8% of the resources that are available in the health  budget will be spent on mental-health issues; the UK average is 12%. The Assembly  must wrestle with that major structural challenge. Despite small additional  funds being allocated for mental health, they will come nowhere near shifting  that balance. Much more must also be done on preventative and public health.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is ridiculous that cost was given as a reason for not  having an independent environmental protection agency, which is a short-sighted  approach. The Assembly must acknowledge the much wider financial and economic  costs that will arise if the environment is not dealt with properly. I  recognise that an independent environmental protection agency is not a panacea  to all problems; however, it would provide a much more robust basis on which to  move forward than the current set of proposals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget (No. 2) Bill is not green. At a time when  everyone should be conscious of the challenges of sustainability and climate  change, the investment strategy proposes to invest some 80% of transport capital  on roads and only some 20% on public transport over the next 10 years. Already,  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  situation is unsustainable compared with that of its neighbours, and it is set  to get worse rather than better. The Assembly has taken a wrong turn in a  climate in which sustain&shy;ability has become pertinent because of the dramatic  rise in fuel costs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to stress the economic issues. The Assembly must  have many more debates and think creatively beyond conventional wisdom. To be  fair and realistic, much of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  economic potential depends on the macroeconomic situation that has been set by  the UK Treasury; control does not lie in the hands of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  Ministers and Assembly. That framework works against Northern   Ireland, and it is a UK regional policy in name only.  The Assembly&rsquo;s major opportunity to effect a step change in the economy was a  differential rate of corporation tax. The Executive have gone quiet on that  issue, and the suspicion is that they have effectively given up.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Instead, discussion now centres on the parameters that were  set by Varney II and on how to do more within the Assembly&rsquo;s existing range of  powers. In a sense, Varney II takes existing economic thinking to its absolute  extreme. However, the sobering fact is that Sir David Varney, when questioned  by DUP members of the Committee for Finance and Personnel, accepted that, based  on his recommendations, he did not envisage any meaningful gross value added  conversions between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the facts that emerge from the UK Treasury, many  independent business organisations and NGOs that have critiqued current  documentation is that they do not expect the major economic growth that has  been advertised on the basis of the Budget. That should form the basis of a  much more serious discussion and a major rethink of the economy by the Assembly  as it takes matters forward. I express my party&rsquo;s disappointment that there has  not been enough discussion of the economy in the Chamber, given that its  importance has been acknowledged by all Assembly parties.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I welcome the Budget (No. 2) Bill. Although, elsewhere, I have welcomed the  Minister to his new post, I have not done so formally in the Chamber. I wish,  therefore, to do so now. It is fair to say that to be thrown into the midst of  a Budget Bill is certainly to be thrown into the deep end of the finance brief.  However, I am sure that all Members agree that the Minister has acquitted  himself with the aplomb that we would expect. As he gets his head around Main Estimates,  Supplementary Estimates, Supply resolutions and various numbered Budget Bills,  the Minister will also start to realise the great sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu that other  Members and I have experienced during Assembly debates, particularly those on  budgetary matters.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I know better, so I will not accuse my colleague on the  Committee for Finance and Personnel of something so awful, but I could almost  swear that I listened to the same speech at Final Stage that I heard at Second  Stage. The Minister will get used to hearing the same issues that we have heard  throughout the debate on the Budget (No. 2) Bill, such as the raising of  capital receipts, efficiencies, the old chestnut of health spending and,  slightly later than normal, the cost of division.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  That was not the same speech, Simon.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  It was the same speech, although it was slightly changed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister will get used to the constant and seemingly  insatiable demands on the limited resources that are at his disposal. It is  fair to say that no Budget will satisfy everyone. I speak for everyone when I  say that there will be areas of any Budget to which people would like more  attention given and more resources allocated. However, we must deal with  limited resources and, as was outlined by the pressing matter of the equal pay  claim that was raised in this morning&rsquo;s statement on the June monitoring round,  we operate within a very tight budgetary framework. Such pressures arise from  time to time that put additional pressure on those limited resources.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that no Member will seriously oppose the Budget  (No. 2) Bill and certainly not Members from parties that have Ministers in the  Executive and who trotted through the Aye Lobby with the rest of us when other  elements of the Budget were debated. I am sure that parties would not vote  against their Minister because that would effectively give a vote of no  confidence in their own Minister&rsquo;s judgement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If Members were minded to vote against the Bill, it would  not be sufficient for them to outline their opposition and their critique,  although they are entitled to do that. They must also answer serious questions  about what they would propose to do about the Budget. During direct rule, we  all played the easy game of saying that we needed more money for x and y, and  more resources for z. On the flip side of that, there are harsh and difficult  questions. Anyone who may be of a mind to oppose the Final Stage of the Budget  (No. 2) Bill should state in the Chamber how he or she proposes to pay for any  additional allocations. If that is not to be done by increased rates, that  Member should say, to use Dr Farry&rsquo;s word, what services he or she would &ldquo;cut&rdquo;  in order to pay for the seemingly insatiable demands.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan spoke at length about children and young people&rsquo;s  funding and the Youth Service, and he specifically mentioned the extended  schools programme. During the Second Stage of the Bill, I spoke at length about  the extended schools programme. It is very clear that the Minister of Education  has a &pound;1&middot;8 billion budget at her disposal, and that, by the end of this Budget  period, she will have had around &pound;400 million a year in additional resources. A  programme such as the extended schools programme, which requires less than &pound;5  million, is an important programme that needs a minor amount of money when  considered as part of that budget. Ample funds are available in the Department  of Education&rsquo;s budget to fund that serious and important programme, if it is a  priority for the Minister of Education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan also raised the issue of the equal pay claim. We  all agree that that is a serious matter, and we are all acutely aware of the  serious ramifications. He asked when people became aware of it. People were  aware of it, but the sheer scale of the problem has only crystallised recently.  We should focus not on how or when that issue arose but on the fact that the  Executive appear to be committed to solving the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much work needs to be done, and I believe that we all want  that injustice sorted out. However, that will take time, and I am grateful that  time is being dedicated to it and that the focus is there to resolve the matter.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was almost moved to tears by Mr O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s contribution,  not through emotion &mdash; he did not stir me to that point &mdash; but because it  comprised one lament after another. I know that he takes these matters  seriously. There are many challenges ahead of the Assembly and the Executive,  and no one thought that devolution would be a cakewalk or that Northern Ireland  would be instantly transformed into a land of milk and honey. There were always  going to be challenges ahead.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget (No. 2) Bill demonstrates the distinctive mark  that devolution, rather than direct rule, can put on a Budget. Such challenges  &mdash; never mind some of the other problems raised by direct rule &mdash; are better  addressed by locally accountable Ministers, who are answerable to the Assembly  and the electorate, than by direct rule Ministers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry spoke about one of his other hobby horses, health  spending. Those arguments have been well rehearsed. The subject has been  touched on a number of times, much like the cost-of-division debate. As he  said, record expenditure, underpinned by this Budget, has been allocated to  health.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan mentioned an interview with the head of the  Health Service Executive in the Irish Republic that appeared a few weeks ago in a Dublin Sunday paper.  There was a second interview the week after, and that was a clear-cut  demonstration of the debate about resource management and accountability. That  is the direction that this debate must take.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The former Finance Minister said that at the end of this  Budget period, the public will not be discussing how much money Departments  received, but, rather, what they delivered using those resources. The most  important matter ahead is the debate about the accountability for, and  management of, those resources. I welcome the Health and Social Care (Reform)  Bill that is before the House, and I hope that it will provide an opportunity  to discuss those matters.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry mentioned another hobby horse &mdash; he has so many  that he could stage his own Derby  &mdash; the call for more fiscal control in the Assembly. He and I differ wildly on  that point. This is a time of economic uncertainty &mdash; I will not mention the  R-word, for fear of adding to the almost inevitable public outcry. Mentioning  it would be a self-fulfilling prophecy. If ever there was a time when we would  not want fiscal control, it is during a recession. It would be difficult for  this Assembly, with its limited financial capabilities, to cope in a time of  economic uncertainty.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Does the Member&rsquo;s party still support Northern Ireland having a  differential rate of corporation tax?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The DUP was among the first political parties to call for a differential rate  of corporation tax, and we still see merit in having such fiscal incentives for  business. When one has banged one&rsquo;s head against a brick wall as many times as  we have on that matter, one begins to feel the pain and to realise that one may  not get through the wall as easily as one had hoped. The various Varney reports  demonstrate that that is not something that the Treasury will grant easily, but  we have not given up the fight. We are not quitters, and, given that there is a  compelling case for fiscal incentives to encourage business growth in Northern Ireland,  we will keep up the call.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is for its focus on business and the economy that I most  welcome the Budget (No. 2) Bill. It focuses full square on growing the economy  in Northern Ireland.  I understand that, at a time when we are experiencing the social problems that  arise from economic uncertainty, some Members may be tempted to switch their  focus from economic growth and development to social issues. Of course, we must  address those pressing social needs and problems, but it is only by focusing  full square on the economy and establishing a good, solid economic foundation  that we can overcome them. For that reason, I wholeheartedly support the Bill,  and I hope that Members will do likewise.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the Budget (No. 2) Bill.  Like Simon, and probably all other Members, I have difficulty with different  aspects of the Budget. I know that we must grow the economy to provide a strong  economy for the future. However, as we move towards that goal, we must remember  those in society who need to be taken care of in the here and now. We must deal  with issues such as housing, fuel poverty, food-price rises, funding social  deprivation and cuts for the community sector. It is on those issues that  communities will judge us, especially those communities that are in need.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It would be remiss of me to let the Bill go through its Final  Stage without mentioning the SDLP&rsquo;s contradictory position. For weeks, senior  SDLP figures have lambasted us about the Budget and told us that they would not  support it, yet their Minister, Margaret Ritchie, was doing the complete  opposite at Executive meetings. They were telling all who would listen that  they were taking a stand, but they must have also been planning to ditch the  Minister or throw her to the wolves because of her support for the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  No, I will not give way. The SDLP must explain why its Members walked through  one Lobby to vote but its Minister went through another. The SDLP is a sorry  spectacle of a party that does not know where it is going. If that is not the  case, the SDLP must say what disciplinary action it has taken against Margaret  Ritchie for that serious breach of party rules.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. In order to have proper order in the  Chamber, should some training be offered to Members so that they can have the  confidence to depart from their script &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. That is not a point of order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I,  too, congratulate the Minister of Finance and Personnel on his recent  appointment to the post. However, like others, I believe that it is not a very  fortunate time to take up office.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This debate is the final outworking of the Budget that was  agreed in January. Money will have been advanced in the early stages of the  budgetary process, and we are now discussing the final details and the transfer  of funding to Departments. The Budget seemed reasonable at the time. If the  Bill is not approved, money will stop flowing to our public services. Do  Members really want some of our public offices to be shut down? If we do not  approve the Budget within the appropriate time frame, that is what will happen.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Where were the proposed amendments at Consider&shy;ation Stage  and Further Consideration Stage? If Members wanted to propose sensible,  constructive changes to the Bill, they should have tabled amendments. Are those  Members saying that Government processes should be shut down in Northern Ireland?  We must approve the Bill, warts and all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That said, questions remain. Why were such significant errors  made in the budgetary calculations? I am thinking of the sale of Government  land at Crossnacreevy. The land had been valued at &pound;200 million, but it has now  been valued at &pound;6 million. We have been told that that revision is down to a  planning matter. Anyone who understands the planning process for the Belfast metropolitan area  plan will know that the land was either zoned or not zoned. How one can get  around that process, I do not know.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, why was no allowance made in the Budget for  the Civil Service equal pay claim? I cannot believe that an additional demand  of more than &pound;100 million could have appeared so late in the day. There must  have been issues that would have made senior staff in Departments, if not  Ministers, aware of the cost implications of that process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am particularly concerned about children&rsquo;s funding. I am  disappointed that so little unspent money was returned that there was  insufficient funding in the monitoring round to deal with the in-year funding  issues on children&rsquo;s issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget process does not deal well with the issue of  children&rsquo;s funding. A large number of the funding streams bring benefits to  many Departments, and no one Department recognises fully the benefits that  occur in others. I am aware that the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister and the junior Ministers &mdash; who are responsible for children&rsquo;s  issues &mdash; are engaged in the matter actively. I hope that it will be addressed  in subsequent monitoring rounds and in time for next year&rsquo;s budgetary process,  in which we are currently engaged.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I said earlier that Minister Dodds was taking over in his  role at an unfortunate time. I wonder whether he feels a bit like Alistair  Darling, who, when he took over from Gordon Brown, had to deal with many of his  predecessor&rsquo;s decisions coming home to roost. I hope that that is not the case.  However, the evidence before us today makes it appear so.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank everyone who has taken part in this short  debate. I suspect, however, that anyone who read the Second Stage debate, which  I did, or, indeed, last year&rsquo;s Budget debate, would recognise many recurring  themes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In reply to Mr Beggs, I do not feel any difficulty, because  any new Finance Minister would get nothing other than the same list of demands,  pressures and complaints laid on him. In that respect, there is nothing new  under the sun. This is a challenging job, but one in which I reflect the views  of a unanimous Executive, despite some comments from some parties in the House.  Perhaps if they took more cognisance of some of their colleagues, they would  have a slightly different perspective on the issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish that I could say, as some Members seem to want me to  be able to say, that I have a bottomless pit of money. Surprise, surprise, I do  not. I know that that will come as a terrible shock to one or two Members, but  those more mature and sensible Members who understand reality will take  cognisance of the situation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was impressed by the many Members who spoke carefully and  realistically in the debate, even if, on occasion, they tended to veer off into  a fantasy world. Nevertheless, most of their remarks were meant sincerely.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will not be able to deal with all the points that were  raised. I want, first, to acknowledge the point that was made by the  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel about the Committee&rsquo;s  intention to examine the logistics of the Budget process. I welcome that, and I  look forward to the outcome of those deliberations.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members raised the issue of equal pay in the Civil  Service. I dealt with that issue during this morning&rsquo;s discussions on the  in-year monitoring round. Mr O&rsquo;Loan asked some questions, but then he helpfully  stated that he had tabled a question for written answer on the issue.  Therefore, I will helpfully respond by saying that I will reply to his question  for written answer, and I am sure that he will look forward to receiving that.  I thank him for tabling the question and for giving me the opportunity to  respond in the way that I suggested.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is nonsense to say that everyone sat back and knew about  the problem but did nothing to address it. The matter crystallized and became  an issue only when the previous Finance Minister brought it to the attention of  the Executive. We must deal with it in the way that I have suggested &mdash; through  serious, intense engagement with the Treasury. The issue is not the  responsibility of the Executive; it is a legacy issue that was inherited from  direct rule Ministers. Therefore, it would be completely invidious if we had to  take a stance that would impact on public services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In other places, I have had the full support of, and best  wishes from, other party members. Although some Members have not expressed  their best wishes, I am sure that I have them, as we tackle the Treasury on the  issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan and others raised the issue of capital receipts,  and Mr Beggs referred to Crossnacreevy and to errors in the Budget. However,  there were no errors in the Budget. I stated yesterday and today that the &pound;50  million allocated this year for the farm nutrients scheme will proceed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Crossnacreevy was part of a capital assets realisation  project, which was in year three of the current compre&shy;hensive spending review  period. The information on the project was provided in good faith, on the basis  of best information available. The general issue of lower levels of capital  receipts means that, in the current economic climate, there will be lower costs  for some infrastructure; for instance, for acquiring land. Mr O&rsquo;Loan looks  slightly puzzled, but if property prices have gone down, the price of land has  also gone down, and it costs less to do things with it. It is a case of simple  economics.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is recognised, however, that there is an issue.  Furthermore, no one referred to the fact that over &pound;100 million in capital  reserves has not been allocated. All those issues will be taken into account  when we have met the Treasury to discuss the equal pay issue. Of the &pound;295  million identified by the capital realisation task force, &pound;200 million were  included in the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will reiterate the assurance that I gave this morning. When  the equal pay issue has been resolved, consideration will be given to  supporting Departments that have taken all possible steps to address the  shortfall in capital receipts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Beggs, Mr O&rsquo;Loan and others raised the issue of funding  for children and young people. As part of the Budget process, funding from  central funds, including the children and young people&rsquo;s funding package, was  mainstreamed. That gave Departments the necessary flexibility to manage such  issues in the context of their overall position.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In response to concerns from Departments, additional  allocations were made as part of the process to ensure that all worthwhile  projects could continue during the draft, and revised, Budget process. The main  problem is that individual Ministers have not decided to discontinue funding  certain projects; rather they have laid the blame elsewhere &mdash; notably at the  Department of Finance and Personnel. There is nothing new in that &mdash; that  happens during every monitoring round. Although the Executive will continue to  consider the amount of resources available to individual public services, the  primary responsibility lies with individual Departments to prioritise resources  under their control.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Returning to the subject of underspending, when the sums  involved are compared with the levels of departmental underspend last year, it  is clear that Departments have the capacity to fund those projects. Recently,  my predecessor issued a statement about underspend, and that raises serious  issues about the effectiveness of spending and the best outputs for the people  we represent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan raised the issue of post-primary education. I  share his concerns for clarity on those arrangements. I hope that, initially,  the Department of Education will meet any additional costs from its existing  Budget allocation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry stuck to well-rehearsed and well-known themes as  usual. He spoke about support for the Budget; however, I remind him that it was  agreed by all members of the Executive in January 2008. Although the nature of  the Budget process inevitably means that it is simply not possible to meet all  pressures, I still believe that the allocations that have been made strike the  right balance.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I ask the Member to give me a moment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We do not have a bottomless pit: if we did, we could  continue to dole out money to everyone&rsquo;s favourite programmes and projects.  However, we live in the real world, in which we have to balance all the  resources that are available to us against all the pressures and demands on  public services. We could go down the Alliance Party&rsquo;s favourite route of  increasing taxation and put a greater burden on the hard-pressed working families  and others in our community who are already suffering because of the increases  in fuel prices and the cost of living. I doubt whether there would be much  support for going down that route, particularly on this side of the House. At  least the Alliance Party seeks to address how it would raise the money through  the Budget process, and does it openly by saying that it would increase  taxation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is noticeable, as Mr Hamilton said in his speech, that  when others criticise the process and demand more money, they are reluctant,  indeed absent, when it comes to making suggestions about where to find that  money, either through increased revenue streams or by re-allocating it from  somewhere else. Mr Beggs drew attention to that when he made the valid point  that when the Bill was debated in the Assembly, not one single amendment was  tabled. That would have been a real test of the sincerity of those Members who  said that they wanted to increase allocations in one area by reducing  allocations elsewhere, or by a re-allocation of resources. Not a single  proposal was made, nor was a single amendment tabled.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members may wish to make a political point or a token  gesture today by voting against the Bill at its Final Stage. Let us be very  clear. As another Member pointed out, the only effect of voting against the  Budget (No.2) Bill today will be to ensure that Departments run out of money  over the summer. All the money for health, education, housing, fuel poverty,  the environment, investment and tourism will run out. We will not only be in  crisis mode, but people will ask what on earth the Assembly is playing at. If  Members want to take such an irresponsible view of such a serious process, so  be it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will give way to the Member, who appears to wish to go  down that route. Perhaps he will clarify his intentions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for giving way. I wish to make two points, and it is  important that I put my first on record. Will the Minister agree that the  Minister for Social Development voted as required by the ministerial code, but  that in the Executive&rsquo;s discussions that led up to the Budget, she raised the  points of concern that were visible at that time, and which I raised again  today?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the Minister has spoken about a threat to bring  down the financial house and not to have the resources to keep the Government  running over the summer. If the Budget (No.2) Bill were to be voted down today,  the onus would rest with the Minister to bring a different Budget to the House.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: We have heard it all now, Mr Deputy Speaker. The  Members opposite are saying that if the Bill is voted down today, the  responsibility will lie with those of us who voted against that proposition.  What a piece of perverted logistical thinking that is.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That simply illustrates the lack of logic, common sense or  any sort of economic or financial probity on the part of Members who say such  things. To say that they will vote it down, and that I must then take the  blame, is absolute nonsense.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member&rsquo;s other point concerned the role of his party&rsquo;s  Minister. The bottom line is that she agreed the Budget in the Executive. The  Executive were unanimous, and the Minister voted for the Budget in the  Assembly. Those facts are on the record, no matter how awkward or embarrassing  they may be for the party opposite.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members, including Dr Farry, talked about  efficiency savings. I welcome the acceptance of the need for Departments to  examine the ways in which they operate to improve efficiency. As I said this  morning and yesterday at Question Time, efficiencies should be about doing  things better in order to release more money for front-line services; they are  not about cuts. We share a common agenda in that respect. It is important that  we pursue efficiencies so that we are not constantly seeking more money. Let us  make better use of the money that we have to produce the output and results  that we want.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry raised the issue of the general economy and lower  corporation tax. We continue to press the case for lowering corporation tax,  because that is what we want. When I was Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment, I was responsible for growing the economy, although the Programme  for Government gave growing the economy centre stage in all Departments. We  absolutely wish to have lower corporation tax, and we have not given up on  achieving that. That continues to be our policy, and we will use opportunities  to press our case, as and when appropriate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must also examine the other policy levers that are at  our disposal. It would be foolish in the extreme to think that a lower rate of  corporation tax will be a silver bullet that will solve all our problems. The  Budget&rsquo;s growth projections are based on existing programmes that must be  reviewed by the Executive. However, I welcome Members&rsquo; calls that the Assembly  should have a greater focus on economic matters in general.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members spoke about children and young people&rsquo;s  projects. I fully recognise the importance of delivering the best possible  services for children and young people. The previous Finance Minister said that  he would consider providing additional funding, based on an agreed list of  projects from the relevant Departments. Those discussions are ongoing, and the  issues will be returned to as part of the September monitoring round, once the  equal pay issue is resolved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank everyone who took part in the debate. We must  balance available resources against emerging pressures in-year and the demands  of all Departments and all the worthy issues that were mentioned.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before we proceed to the Question, I remind Members that, because  this is a Budget Bill, the motion requires cross-community support.</p>

	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question accordingly agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved (with cross-community support):</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Budget (No. 2) Bill [NIA 18/07] do now pass.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="7"></a>Child Maintenance Bill</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Final Stage</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Child Maintenance Bill [NIA 17/07] do now pass.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Child Maintenance Bill is an important piece of  legislation that makes tackling child poverty the main priority of the child  maintenance system. The Bill ensures that more maintenance is collected and  that more of that maintenance goes directly to children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland at the moment, one in three  non-resident parents fail to pay any money that is owed to their children,  leaving 12,600 children without any maintenance and often suffering unnecessary  poverty as a result. Measures contained in the Bill &mdash; together with the  increased disregard of &pound;20 a week by the end of 2008 and &pound;40 a week from April  2010 &mdash; will ensure that many more children will benefit from maintenance and  that will contribute to reducing child poverty in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Parents will be encouraged to make voluntary arrangements  where appropriate. Where such arrangements are not appropriate, parents will be  supported in making applications to the statutory maintenance service thus  avoiding the risk of anyone slipping through the net. The new information and  support service will work to meet the needs of parents: that service will  support parents in making arrangements that are right for them personally, and  offer an improved statutory service to ensure that more children receive the  money that is due to them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will put in place much needed reforms to deal with  the well publicised deficiencies of the current system, which have too often  left parents confused and frustrated and made it very difficult for the staff  charged with administering that system to offer the service that they wish to  provide &mdash; a service that parents and children have a right to expect.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposals will bring into affect more streamlined and  transparent child maintenance arrangements. The Bill makes provisions for the  Department to obtain details of non-resident parents&rsquo; income directly from HM  Revenue and Customs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That will provide the Department with easily accessible and  accurate details of earned income, meaning that more money will flow more  quickly to more children. That is the express purpose of the Bill &mdash; to ensure  that money flows to children more expeditiously. Nobody in this House wishes to  deny children who are in need the right to receive the money to which they are  entitled at the same time as children in GB.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The use of administrative liability orders will make the  process of enforcing arrears considerably quicker, and the power to collect  money from bank accounts and other financial resources will mean that the  Department can collect the money as quickly as possible. There will be an  extension to the type of accounts against which ongoing and lump-sum deduction  orders can be made. The Department will be able to apply for an order to freeze  a non-resident parent&rsquo;s assets if there is evidence that they are about to  dissipate them to avoid paying child maintenance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The current enforcement and compliance measures are not as  effective as they could be, and the process does not facilitate swift  enforcement action; therefore the provisions of the Bill place emphasis on  stronger and more effective enforcement. I accept that the measures are strong,  but the money in these cases is owed to the children. I stress again that the  enforcement powers will be used only where non-resident parents will not &mdash; as  opposed to cannot &mdash; pay. It is right and fair that effective measures should be  used against parents who deny their children the maintenance that is due to  them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I read with interest the transcript of last Tuesday&rsquo;s  debate on the report of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and  the deputy First Minister on its inquiry into child poverty in Northern Ireland.  I will study that report very carefully. I wholeheartedly agree with the  Committee that the Executive should ensure that government services should  respond decisively to the needs of low-income families. I intend to ensure that  my Department does so. The provisions in the Child Maintenance Bill will put in  place a new framework for the child maintenance system to benefit low-income  families in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Chairperson, the outgoing Chairperson, and  members of the Committee for Social Development &mdash; and indeed Members of the  House &mdash; for their support in progressing this important Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Simpson)</strong>: As the House is  aware, this important piece of legislation was granted accelerated passage. As  a result, the Committee for Social Development did not have a chance to  scrutinise it in any great detail as would normally be the case. The Committee  will play an important scrutiny role when the legislation has been passed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the Second Stage of the Bill, the Deputy Chairperson  referred to several areas that were of interest to the Committee, one of which  was the use of enforce&shy;ment provisions. The Minister has assured the Committee  &mdash; and the House &mdash; that only those parents who will not pay as opposed to those  who cannot pay will be subject to such measures. I sincerely hope that that  will be the case. The Committee will be considering that issue in the future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee supports the drive to get parents to make  their own arrangements for the payment of child maintenance, which should  reduce levels of non-payment. It is of the utmost importance that the  Department ensure that parents with care know their rights in the statutory  maintenance system, and are not pressurised into entering into a voluntary  arrangement. Voluntary arrangements will not suit every couple.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill&rsquo;s most important aim is to get money to children  who are entitled to it. If we are to focus on meeting the needs of children and  to tackle child poverty effectively, we must ensure that more parents take  responsibility for paying for their children and that more children benefit.  However, it remains to be seen whether non-resident parents who will not pay  under the statutory system will pay under a voluntary one.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee supports the Bill, with those caveats.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. A central tenet of the Bill is to  make a difference between those who cannot pay and those who will not pay.  However, there are concerns about how the Bill will reduce child poverty; there  is little evidence in it of how the Minister proposes to do that. There is  concern about the Bill&rsquo;s effect on second families. Will the children of second  families be more vulnerable to deprivation as a result of the Bill? Those  questions have not been satisfactorily addressed. The Minister has given a  commitment that an equality impact assessment (EQIA) will be made  simultaneously with the Bill&rsquo;s implementation. I look forward to that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has, in effect, broken parity with England, as the  Child Support Agency (CSA) will continue to exist there, albeit in a revamped  form. Here, the Minister proposes that the Social Security Agency will be responsible  for the implementation of child maintenance payments. I question whether the  infrastructure is adequate: has the Social Security Agency sufficient resources  to implement the Bill or will it be given those resources?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that she is more than aware of concerns  about the Child Support Agency. I hope that resources will be made available to  the Social Security Agency (SSA) so that it can implement the provisions of the  Bill. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Members for their contributions. I welcome the  Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development to his new position, thank  him for raising issues, pay him tribute and, as I have not yet had an  opportunity to do so on the Floor of the House, wish him well. I expect the  Committee to undertake scrutiny of the Bill&rsquo;s implementation, for that is its  role.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to ensure that money flows as expeditiously as  possible to the children who need it. Mr Simpson asked how we ensure that  parents are not leant on to enter into voluntary arrangements. The information  and support that my Department will provide includes a helpline with web-based  support and face-to-face service where appropriate. Tools, such as a standard maintenance  form and an on-line calculator to help with estimating the level of  child-maintenance-based income, will be provided to enable parents to make  informed choices with respect to maintenance agreements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brady raised the issue of second families. The Bill  provides for fairness between children of first and second families so that  second families are not disadvantaged to finance the wellbeing of the first. I  assure the House that the maintenance formula introduced in 2003 takes account  of children in first and second families and the revised percentages will  ensure that that continues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brady also raised the subject of child poverty, about  which I would like to make the following points. The Bill provides for the  removal of the provision whereby the parent with care can lose &pound;24&middot;20 a week if  a reduced benefit decision is imposed; enabling parents to keep more of the  child maintenance that they receive by increasing the maintenance disregard to  &pound;20 a week by the end of 2008 and &pound;40 a week from 2010; and the introduction of  administrative liability orders. Those measures will speed up the process and  reduce the time taken to enforce the collection of arrears.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is the combined effect of the measures that will ensure  that more children are lifted out of poverty. I hope that all absent parents  demonstrate their responsibilities to their children. It is in our interest and  in theirs that their children are properly cared for, both socially and financially,  particularly at a time when we are all feeling the pinch given the higher cost  of fuel, power and food. Indeed, those factors are most affecting those who are  in the low-to-medium income groups, who are facing a higher level of inflation  and incomes that are not necessarily rising to keep pace with that level of  inflation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brady is living with a misunderstanding as regards the  Child Support Agency and parity. As a result of the Henshaw Review it was  decided that, in Britain,  the Child Support Agency should be kept at arm&rsquo;s length. I feel that it would  be better to bring the agency into the core of the Department, where it could  be subject to full scrutiny and where the problems of the past could be  properly addressed, resolved and rectified. Furthermore, problems in getting  money to children could be resolved in a more expeditious fashion. That is the  purpose of the Child Support Agency, and I hope that everyone would be able to  live up to their responsibilities in that respect.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that I have responded satisfactorily to the points  that have been raised. If I have missed any point, I will write to the Member  concerned. During the debates on accelerated passage and Second Stage, I made  the point that if Sinn F&eacute;in were to abandon its policy of abstentionism, and  take its seats at Westminster,  its members would have full and ample opportunity to debate the parent  legislation. I make the point again today. I suggest to Mickey Brady that if  his party&rsquo;s abstentionist policy were abandoned, it would have full opportunity  for line-by-line scrutiny of the parent Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, this Bill is a child poverty measure: it  removes the reduced-benefit decision and it deals with non-compliant,  non-resident parents in a better, more expeditious fashion. The most important  feature of the Bill is that it takes the side of children and parents with  care. I do not believe that any Member of the House would resile from that  viewpoint, as it is the view that was communicated in the Committee and in the  House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Child maintenance makes an important contribution to  tackling child poverty, and it can make a significant difference to the lives  of families. This Bill is good news, and it is a good news story for children  in Northern Ireland.  Again, I am grateful to the Chairperson, the outgoing Chairperson, the members  of the Committee for Social Development, and Members for their positive  contribution during the progress of the Bill, and for the level of consensus  that the Bill has enjoyed across the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Child Maintenance Bill [NIA 17/07] do now pass.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="8"></a>Committee Business</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Public Enquiry into the Maureen &nbsp;McGinley Case</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to  propose the motion and 10 minutes for the winding-up speech. All other Members  will have five minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses concern that investigations by  the Western Health and Social Care Trust and the Coroner&rsquo;s Service have failed  to provide a satisfactory explanation of the circumstances in which the late  Mrs Maureen McGinley received a number of fractures following her death;  commends the family of Mrs Maureen McGinley for their campaign in highlighting  the issue; and calls on the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety to initiate, as a matter of urgency, a full, independent and time-bound  public inquiry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I first extend my deepest sympathy to the late Maureen  McGinley&rsquo;s family, some of whom I believe are in the Public Gallery.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Maureen McGinley came from Strabane and died in Altnagelvin Hospital  in Londonderry on Wednesday 3 January 2007,  aged 78. The doctor would not issue a death certificate because Mrs McGinley  had fallen at home a few days earlier, before being admitted to hospital.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On Friday 5 January 2007, two days after her death, a  post-mortem that was carried out at Belfast  city mortuary concluded that Mrs McGinley had died from natural causes; namely,  pneumonia or a lung infection. Heart disease was listed as a possible  contributing factor. Most alarmingly, the autopsy also revealed that Mrs  McGinley had suffered 34 fractures to her ribs. The autopsy report states:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;there was only a small amount of bruising associated  with two of these fractures, strongly suggesting that the vast majority of them  were sustained after death, probably as the body was being moved.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In a letter to the hospital two months later, in March  2007, the deputy state pathologist, who carried out the autopsy, explained:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;post-mortem fractures of ribs and sternum are  frequently encountered in cases where cardiopulmonary resuscitation has been  attempted. However, I understand that no resuscitation had been attempted on  Mary McGinley, and the distribution of rib fractures was not entirely  consistent with the effects of resuscitation. Therefore, I concluded that they  must have been sustained while the body was being moved after death. Very  occasionally one or two post-mortem rib fractures may be identified at autopsy,  particularly in the elderly, however a large number of post-mortem fractures is  extremely unusual, even in the presence of marked osteoporosis. This would  strongly suggest that at some point during the handling or moving of the body  some considerable force had been applied to the chest, however there are no  specific features to indicate exactly how they were sustained.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Investigations by the Western Health and Social Care Trust  and by the Coroners Service have signally failed to provide any satisfactory  explanation for how those fractures were sustained by Mrs McGinley after her  death.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s family have spent 18 months fighting,  lobbying and campaigning incessantly for answers. The local community was  rightly shocked by what happened and supports the family&rsquo;s campaign for  answers. They started a petition calling for a full, independent and public  inquiry, and collected a staggering 18,500 signatures. That reflects an amazing  amount of public disquiet.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That petition was brought to the Committee for Health,  Social Services and Public Safety on 28 February 2008. The Committee passed the  petition to the Minister and urged him to launch an inquiry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  responded:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;events surrounding Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s death have been  subjected to a very comprehensive examination, both internally by the Trust,  and by the coroner&rsquo;s service, who took responsibility for delivering her body  to the Belfast City Mortuary for post-mortem. Despite  that comprehensive investigation it has not been possible to provide a totally  satisfactory explanation for the fractures which Mrs McGinley sustained after  her death.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister concluded that he was:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;of the view that any further review &hellip; is unlikely to  shed any further light on how this unfortunate incident occurred.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is totally unsatisfactory and unacceptable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One has to ask how difficult it can be to ascertain from  duty rotas who handled the body and to then follow the process through to a  satisfactory conclusion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The death of a mother is a tragic and heartbreaking event  in itself, but, in this case, not only had the family to suffer the grief and  sadness of losing a loved one, they had the added shock of learning that  something dreadful happened to their mother after her death, resulting in her  having 34 broken bones. One of the principles of any civilised society is that  we treat the dead with dignity and respect. The very least that the family  should expect is a thorough investigation that gets to the bottom of what  happened between the time of Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s death on a hospital ward and the  start of the post-mortem, two days later. The family cannot begin to grieve for  their mother while those questions remain unanswered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The family has made it clear that they are not interested  in recriminations and that they just want answers. They want an explanation and  an apology for what happened. We can all identify with the position in which  the family find themselves. We just have to think of how we would react if the  same thing happened to any of our own mothers or to a close relative. We would go  to any lengths and would leave no stone unturned until we got an explanation of  how and why such an event happened.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Following her death on 3 January 2007, Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s body  was moved from the ward to the mortuary at Altnagelvin  Hospital, and it remained there until  it was collected by the undertaker early on the Friday morning and transported  to the Belfast city mortuary in the grounds of Forster Green Hospital.  Clearly, something happened to Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s body during that period, and the  family has a right to an explanation. The only way to get answers seems to be  to hold a full public inquiry during which anyone who had any dealings with the  body from the time of Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s death in the hospital ward to the  beginning of the post-mortem is questioned under oath.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister may claim that he cannot set up an inquiry  because the issues fall between two jurisdictions &mdash; namely, the Health Service,  for which he has responsibility, and the Coroners Service, which is the  responsibility of David Hanson MP, Minister of State. This case cries out for  justice and for an explanation, and ways must be found to deal with any issues  that fall between the two jurisdictions. Until now, the Minister has rejected  all calls for an inquiry, saying that there is nothing to be gained from holding  one. I ask the Minister to consider how he would react if a close relative of  his had suffered such fractures after death. I therefore urge him to show the  same compassion and sympathy to the McGinley family that he would expect in  such circumstances and to set up an inquiry that will get answers. I urge  Members to support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the motion. I thank the  Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, and  all members of that Committee, for bringing the matter before the House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion states that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the Western Health and Social Care Trust and the  Coroner&rsquo;s Service have failed to provide a satisfactory explanation of the  circumstances&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">that surround this case. I have looked at some of the  documentation, and although I am neither a medic nor a forensic scientist, my  reading of the papers shows inconsistencies and gaps. For example, I could not  follow the chronology at all times.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Chairperson of the Committee said, as far as the  family is concerned, this is not about blame; it is about finding out what  happened. I appeal to the Minister to hold an inquiry, because this is about a  mother and about a family that does not know what happened. It is also about  the Health Service workers and all the other people who may have been around  the body who do not know what happened.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For the sake of truth and fairness, a public inquiry will  get the desired answers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The second part of the motion commends the family of  Maureen McGinley, and I echo that sentiment. The situation has not been easy  for them, and the grieving process has not taken place because the issue  remains unresolved. The family is seeking only a public inquiry. I repeat: this  is not about blame.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A public inquiry is required in this case because the  Assembly Ombudsman, in response to a complaint lodged with him against the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety by Mr Pat Doherty, MP  for West Tyrone, said that his powers were limited. The legislative reasons for  those limited powers can be discussed another day, but the fact that the  Assembly Ombudsman is powerless in this situation is an issue in itself.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was disappointed with the response from Elaine Way in a  letter from the Western Health and Social Care Trust. The McGinley family&rsquo;s  situation as regards losing their mother is known, as is the situation  regarding what happened after that; however, the tone of the letter, which is  dated 21 April 2008, was inappropriate:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The trust is entirely satisfied that it has acted  appropriately and consequently sees no benefit in attending a further meeting  at which we could be confirming again the trust&rsquo;s position, which has been fully  explained to you.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I read that letter only recently, and there is coldness in  it. That may be how such letters are written, but I return to the point I made  at the beginning of my remarks &mdash; this issue is about a mother and what happened  to her after her death. As the Chairperson of the Committee said; this is not  about blame; it is about the people who were involved in the sequence of events  between Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s death and the time that the family received the autopsy  report. I appeal to the Minister to commission an inquiry, because that would  go some way towards getting satisfactory answers.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: The circumstances that have led to the motion are extremely sad,  and I offer my deepest sympathies and those of my party to the McGinley family.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What happened to Maureen McGinley after her death would  have been difficult for a family to come to terms with in any circumstances.  However, still not knowing what happened is particularly difficult. I thank the  Minister for coming to the Chamber to respond to the motion. I also thank him  for meeting the McGinley family.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that the Western Health and Social Care Trust  has carried out a comprehensive examination of the circumstances surrounding  the case. I also recognise that the Minister believes that the trust acted  appropriately. The Western Health and Social Care Trust has given assurances  that Mrs McGinley was treated with the utmost respect and dignity at all times.  The Coroners Service for Northern Ireland  made no recommendations to the trust about the procedures in place at Altnagelvin Hospital. Although I recognise those  statements and have no reason to doubt them, in light of what we know about the  case, they do not offer the closure and reassurance that the McGinley family  requires and deserves.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome that the McGinley family has employed Professor  Christopher Milroy to examine the post-mortem injuries suffered by Maureen  McGinley.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the fact that the Minister has stated his  intention to consider the report if it reaches a different conclusion to that  of the investigations that have already been conducted.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland, we have a strong history of  treating people with dignity, respect and care. The staff in the Health Service  and in the Coroners Service are dedicated, professional and caring. I know that  they, as much as anyone, want the McGinley family to receive the answers that  they deserve.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is regrettable that the issue had to be brought to the  Floor of the House. Although I welcome the meeting earlier today between the  Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public  Safety and the Minister, it is unfortunate that such a meeting was not  requested by the Minister at an earlier date.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  convey my deepest sympathy to the family of the late Maureen McGinley. Her case  is sad, and, naturally, the family has been badly affected by it. I have the  utmost respect for the McGinley family, who are trying desperately to discover  how Mrs McGinley sustained so many fractures. They have shown great courage and  strength during a difficult time. It is hard enough to get through the grieving  process without this awful issue hanging over them. It has been a long  struggle, and, unfortunately, it seems that satisfactory answers have not yet  been provided.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public  Safety considered Maureen McGinley&rsquo;s case, I tried to imagine how I would feel  had it happened to a relative of mine and what I would want to establish and  find out. The family wants and deserves answers, to which they are entitled; I  would want the same. They want to know what happened to their mother&rsquo;s body  that resulted in 34 fractures and how it happened. It is an extraordinary  number of fractures, and questions need to be asked and answered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Minister McGimpsey turned down a request for a full  independent inquiry on the grounds that it is unlikely to uncover the cause of  the injuries. I appreciate the fact that the Committee has today called on the  Minister to initiate a public inquiry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The family wants an independent public inquiry into the  case and have started a petition, and they have picketed outside Altnagelvin Hospital to highlight their demand. I  understand that the Western Health and Social Care Trust conducted an investigation  and that the Coroners Service also undertook an independent inquiry.  Unfortunately, the senior coroner concluded that the service had not been able  to establish how Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s ribs came to be fractured. However, it was made  clear that Mrs McGinley suffered from osteoporosis, which may have contributed  to her ribs being fractured with little force.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, the question about when and how the  fractures occurred remains unanswered. Obviously, more information is required  to establish how the fractures were sustained. I do not know whether that  information can be teased out. The McGinley family have appointed an  independent expert &mdash; Professor Christopher Milroy &mdash; and I am glad that the  Coroners Service has offered him full co-operation. I have no doubt that the  Minister and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety will  do the same. The results of Professor Milroy&rsquo;s inquiry will be interesting.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that all avenues are explored to ensure  that nothing is overlooked in this case. I hope that the family gets the  answers that they so much want and need, and that they can put the issue to  rest and get on with their grieving.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I also support the motion fully and unequivocally. I welcome the members of the  McGinley family who are present today. I have no doubt that this is another  difficult time for them in this stage of their grieving process for their  mother. I thank the Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services  and Public Safety for tabling the motion and for outlining the case at the  outset of the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not an advocate of public inquiries.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, when we examine this particular case and the  failure of the Western Health and Social Care Trust, the Department of Health,  and the Minister to provide satisfactory answers to the McGinley family after  almost 18 months, it is evident that a full, independent and time-bound inquiry  is the only way forward for the family. I must commend the family for their  courage in pressing the matter to this stage. Today, I ask the Minister to take  note of the public interest in this particular matter and of the petition of  some 18,000 signatures. Not only must the Minister take note of that, but he  must act upon it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When a loved one passes away in hospital it is assumed that  their remains will be treated with the utmost care, respect and dignity. Yet on  the occasion in question, Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s body, from the point of death until  the coroner&rsquo;s examination, sustained a staggering total of 34 fractures. That  raises the question: what happened between those two points in time? Of course,  the McGinley family is fully justified to seek answers: not only to allow them  to bring closure to their mother&rsquo;s death, but to allow them to complete the  grieving process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On previous occasions, the Minister has said, in his responses  to Assembly questions and in press statements, that he is satisfied that the  trust acted appropriately and in accordance with hospital protocol. However, in  light of the incident, I question whether those protocols are appropriate or  need to be reviewed. I also note that the coroner Mr John L Leckey informed the  McGinley family that their mother&rsquo;s injuries were caused by accident, although  they were unable to identify at what stage or under what circumstances they  were sustained. However, someone somewhere knows what happened. The McGinley  family seeks to get to the bottom of that. What happened to their mother after  her death for her to sustain those injuries?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Today, I am not pointing the finger at the nursing or  front-line staff, who provide an excellent service for patients, for which we  are most grateful. However, I must lay the blame at the door of the managers  and the Minister, who have failed to provide appropriate answers for the  family.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility to provide the McGinley  family with the answers that they seek. To have a blank sheet is simply not  acceptable. We need answers about what happened. The Health Committee has  received conflicting reports on whether or not Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s body was washed  after her death, which highlights and strengthens the need for an inquiry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The McGinley family has exercised patience and displayed  great courage in their efforts to date to gain results without success. During  that time they have been unable to grieve for a mother &mdash; as other families can  do &mdash; due to the lack of closure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Today, I tender my sympathy to them. I hope that their  ordeal will be over soon. The responsibility now lies with the Minister; if he  has nothing to hide then he will act upon the Committee&rsquo;s call, through the  House today, to initiate &mdash; as a matter of urgency &mdash; a full, independent and  time-bound inquiry to get answers for the McGinley family, which they rightly  deserve.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I congratulate the Chairperson,  Iris Robinson, and the Deputy Chairperson, Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, and, indeed, all  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety for bringing  this motion forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also wish to reiterate the Assembly Health Committee&rsquo;s  call for Minister Michael McGimpsey to initiate a full, independent public  inquiry into the circumstances by which deceased Strabane woman Maureen  McGinley was found, upon post-mortem, to have sustained 34 rib fractures  following her death at Altnagelvin   Hospital on 3 January  2007.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are many disturbing aspects to that case, which have  not only served to cause immense additional trauma, but widespread public  concern about the deficiencies in the present arrangements between hospitals  and the Coroners Service when a deceased person is sent for post-mortem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that the McGinley family was not informed about  the injuries that their mother sustained until more than 10 weeks after her  death is grounds in itself for a public inquiry. Furthermore, the subsequent  in-house inquiry that was carried out by Altnagelvin Hospital &mdash; its critical  incident review report &mdash; was basically an exercise in absolving itself and the  Coroners Service of any responsibility regarding how those injuries were  sustained.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Through unfounded conjecture and assumptions, the  Altnagelvin inquiry attempted to place the blame at the door of the undertaker  who transported the body of Maureen McGinley from Altnagelvin to the  post-mortem in Belfast.  If any attempt had been made to ascertain, from the undertaker in question, the  methods by which he secures a body to a stretcher, it would have been  established that he affixes straps across the shoulders, knees and ankles &mdash; a  method that could not have caused the fractures to the chest area that were  sustained by Maureen McGinley.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Contradictory statements were made about whether the body  of Maureen McGinley was washed following her death at Altnagelvin. Those must  also be studied. The McGinley family has been courageous in their campaign to  secure the truth about what happened to their mother, and have exhausted every  possible avenue in pursuit of that cause &mdash; only to find their efforts  frustrated at every turn.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 25 February, I accompanied the McGinley family to a  meeting with the Health Minister, Michael McGimpsey. At that meeting, he stated  that he would rule nothing out, including the possibility of establishing a  full, independent public inquiry. The McGinley family left the meeting with the  renewed hope that they could, at long last, secure the answers that they  deserved and which would enable them to finally bring closure to what has been  a devastating ordeal. One can therefore understand their extreme disappointment  when Michael McGimpsey, in his written response on 6 March following our  meeting, merely regurgitated the arbitrary assumptions that the McGinley family  have been fed from day one.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister initially declined the McGinley family&rsquo;s  request to meet, and they now feel that the only reason that the Minister  finally agreed to meet them on 25 February was because failure to do so would  have attracted adverse media attention to the Minister and his Department. It  now seems that the Minister merely went through the motions at the meeting, and  when the door closed behind us it was a case of out of sight, out of mind.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">More than 18,000 people have signed a petition that calls  for a full, independent inquiry into the case of Maureen McGinley. It is clear  that the case is a matter of major public concern, as it is directly linked to  the issue of healthcare for elderly people in our society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that the Coroners Service is an agency of the NIO  and, as such, remains a reserved matter, should not be used as an excuse to  rule out an inquiry. It is essential for an inquiry to be established, not only  to secure the truth about what happened in the case of Maureen McGinley, but  also to ensure that the confidence in the system that the public have lost as a  result of this disturbing case is restored.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The good practice and guidance that is usually applied in  the NHS to build better pathology services has been well received, because it  put patients and bereaved families at the centre of its concerns. When a  patient dies, families need to know that the mortuary service will deal with  the body of their loved one in a safe, secure and sensitive manner, whether the  death has taken place in a hospital or the body has been taken to the hospital  mortuary after death.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The public usually has confidence in those who have such an  important role in providing that service, and confidence that there is a  balance between the need to ensure safety and efficiency, and showing respect  and sensitivity at such a critical moment in a family&rsquo;s grief.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The application of eight key principles in the NHS  improvement plan has done much to encourage and assure people in the Province  that they can be confident that staff are encouraged to develop a standard of  excellence in that area.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The care offered by the NHS in the event of a death is  important to a family as they grieve for the loss of a loved one. However, that  was not the case for the McGinley family. Mrs McGinley died from pneumonia, but  for the family to learn that her body had sustained 34 fractures after her  death without receiving a rational explanation was a horrifying experience.  Now, a year and a half later, they still have not received a satisfactory  explanation. To my mind, that is scandalous.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The statements that the family has received have been  couched in official language. The family is entitled to clear and precise  answers to their questions, and that has not happened. If the Minister had  responded sufficiently in the two letters that he sent to the Health Committee,  and if clear answers had been provided to the family, there might have been no  need for a debate. The family has my personal sympathy, and that of the vast  majority of Members. I commend the family for their continuing campaign to  highlight the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The investigations by the Western Health and Social Care  Trust and the Coroners Service have been unable to provide satisfactory  answers. Only a full, independent and time-bound inquiry will give the family  the closure that they need, and I call on the Minister to provide such an  inquiry.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  also support the motion. I commend the Committee for the consideration it has  shown to the needs of the McGinley family, and I commend the Chairperson and  the Deputy Chairperson for their work in trying to take the matter forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is difficult for the McGinley family to hear their  situation debated in the Chamber. We must show sensitivity to the confusion of  emotions that that family are feeling. They have had to endure grievance on top  of grief, and no family should have to undergo that. The family found out weeks  and weeks later that their mother had received multiple fractures after her  death. They are asking why and how that happened and why they were not told,  but they have not been given any answers. It is not enough for any of us to suggest  to the family that it was a mystery event that they will have to get over, or  that they at least take comfort from the fact that the injuries happened only  after their mother&rsquo;s death, and that that is all the assurance they need. They  need to know, and they have a right to ask. We have a duty of consideration and  care. If accountability means anything, it means that the McGinley family, and  the public representatives who have been working on their behalf, should be  looked in the eye and given answers, and people should be available to provide  those answers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We often refer to leaving no stone unturned. If any of us  found ourselves in the same situation with a close relative, we would want to  believe that no stone would be left unturned in finding out what had happened,  and how and why, and to ensure that it would not happen to another family. The  McGinley family feel that the system appears to be saying that some stones will  be left unturned, because either nothing new will be found or something  unwanted might be found. It is incumbent on the Assembly and the Minister to  pursue any inquiry or any means of investigation that is needed to provide  answers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have been told that there is no satisfactory explanation  for the fractures. That in itself cannot be a satisfactory outcome &mdash; it adds to  the sense of frustration, scandal and hurt that is felt by the family. It is  not just the family, their friends and neighbours who feel that way; as the  petition shows, there is widespread and strong public concern about what has  happened. That concern has been compounded by the lack of answers and by the  apparent attempt to suggest that it is somehow untoward to pursue answers to  those questions through an inquiry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have also heard that the trust offered assurances that  the body was treated with respect at all times. The Minister is clearly on the  record as believing those assurances. I do not know how the rest of us can rely  on them: given that we have neither the evidence nor the insight to do so, we  cannot commend those assurances to the family, or, indeed, to the wider public,  which deserves to have its confidence restored.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People working in the healthcare system and those who work  in the hospital concerned want to see that wider confidence restored, because  in a sense, there is a cloud over everyone. As Pat Doherty implied, suggestions  have been made that different people might be to blame. Veiled references have  been made to the role of the undertaker, and questions have been asked about  nurses and other hospital staff. None of us wants to see those sorts of  questions ricocheting around unanswered, hurting a lot of people as well as  grieving the McGinley family. That is the reason that a public inquiry is  needed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I offer my sympathy to the McGinley family, and I congratulate them for their  efforts to establish the truth of this case. I also commend the people who  carry out daily the difficult work in mortuaries quietly and unassumingly. I  speak not to criticise them, but to find the truth of this one case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All of us wish &mdash; and expect &mdash; that dignity, care and  respect be shown to a family member or friend when they die. That is assumed by  us all, and we take that for granted as the norm. In the majority of cases,  that is exactly what happens. It is also the aim of the second, sixth and  seventh principles of the document &lsquo;Care and Respect in Death: Good Practice  Guidance for NHS Mortuary Staff&rsquo;. There are, however, occasions, such as that  now under debate, when something goes wrong. In such circumstances, it is only  dignified, respectful and professional that the families are told the truth of  what has happened. That will perhaps help them to begin their grieving process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Something went seriously wrong in this case, and I am sure  that the Minister knows that. He should be prepared to commit to a public  inquiry to identify any potential flaws in the system, but, most importantly,  to get to the truth for the McGinley family. A public inquiry would also  prevent the same circumstances occurring again.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will therefore ask the Minister two questions. First,  does he dispute the findings of Dr Bentley, who stated that the numerous  fractures were caused post mortem? Secondly, does the Minister accept that the  Coroners Service told the family that the injuries were caused by accident? If  he does accept that, he must accept that the Coroners Service is apparently in  the possession of facts that confirm the accidental status of the injuries and  their post-mortem cause but that all previous enquiries have apparently been  unable to establish, or have overlooked. A public inquiry is certainly  justified in this case, and, in my view, it is a necessity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The McGinley family are reported by the Press Association  on 25 April as saying that they do not want any money because that is not what  this matter is about. For that I commend them. What the family, and all of us,  want is the truth &mdash; not a witch-hunt, not money, just the truth. I say to the  Minister that I support them in their search for the truth, and I urge him to  launch a public inquiry as soon as possible so that the truth in this case can  be established and a similar occurrence in can be prevented. I commend the  Chairperson of the Health Committee for bringing the motion to the House. I  support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I support the motion and offer my sympathy, and that of my party, to Mrs  McGinley&rsquo;s family. Losing a loved one is hard enough. What the family has had  to endure, however, is totally unacceptable. No one should suffer that further  blow after a loved one&rsquo;s death.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank my United Community group colleague Dr Kieran Deeny  for the hard work that he has carried out on this deplorable incident. His  efforts are widely appreciated by all who are involved in this terribly sad  case. Unfortunately, due to family circumstances, Dr Deeny cannot be present  for the debate, although he fully supports the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is abundantly clear that the family, and other people,  do not believe that the Coroners Service has provided a satisfactory  explanation for the circumstances of Maureen&rsquo;s injuries; far from it, in fact.  I do not wish to attribute blame, but merely to say that I know from what Dr  Deeny and others have said that the circumstances have not been fully  clarified. As other Members have pointed out, the McGinley family deserve full  credit for their campaign. Their endurance must be applauded. Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s  case may not be the only one of its kind in the UK  or Ireland.  Therefore, her family have not only served their own cause, but, perhaps, that  of other families.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must determine what action should be taken on the case.  First, clarification is needed on whether the care and respect in death  good-practice guidance was adhered to. The guidance contains eight key  principles. It is worth seeking evidence on whether those were properly  applied. It is highly possible, for example, that the process of moving  Maureen&rsquo;s body, or working with it, could have caused fractures. That is why it  must be known whether correct procedures were followed. I am aware that the family  has been informed that no further action will be taken by the Coroners Service  unless further information becomes available. The question is how such  information can be made available.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that 34 rib fractures, without bleeding, were  found during a post-mortem of Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s body. Those fractures must have  occurred after death. That is frightening. We must establish precisely what  happened. We cannot simply wait for information to become available. The  explanations that have been put forward so far &mdash; that the fractures were caused  by restraints that were used by the undertaker, movement of the body from the  hospital, and even resuscitation attempts &mdash; range from the unlikely to the  impossible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The call for a public inquiry is tempting. My party will  not oppose that call. However, the key word in the motion is &ldquo;independent&rdquo;. An  independent inquiry would answer questions on how more information about what  happened to the late Maureen McGinley can be made available in a way that  delivers clarity &mdash; and is seen to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Chairperson of the Health Committee, who tabled  the motion. On behalf of the United Community group, I state our full support  for the motion and, specifically, for an independent and time-bound inquiry.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I, like other  Members, will begin by expressing my sincere sympathy with the McGinley family.  Any family death creates a sad loss. However, the loss of a mother, who is,  often, the source of the family&rsquo;s love and support, is extremely difficult. I  understand how difficult it must be for the family, not only to lose their  mother, but to learn that she sustained injuries after her death. Anyone would  be distressed and disturbed to learn that a loved one&rsquo;s body had suffered  injury after death.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is why the McGinley family&rsquo;s desire to know how that  happened is understandable. When I met the family in February, it was clear  that they were still grieving for their mother and that they were naturally  upset and angry that they still did not have a clear explanation about how the  fractures were sustained. I understand and appreciate the increasing difficulty  that that must continue to pose almost 18 months after Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s death and  the impact that such uncertainty must have on immediate family members and on  the wider family circle.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Death is not an uncommon experience for nursing staff. Each  year, there are around 15,000 deaths in Northern Ireland, more than half of  which occur in hospitals. As a result, healthcare staff are familiar with the  processes and procedures that are required to provide appropriate care for the  body of a deceased individual. That does not mean that healthcare staff are not  affected and distressed by the death of a patient; rather, they take forward  their duties in a highly professional manner. At all times, staff know to treat  a body with due respect, care and dignity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It should be remembered that, along with everyone else,  healthcare staff will suffer the loss of a loved one. Throughout their  training, they are instilled with the ethos of caring for patients at all  times. Today, we are even more aware than we were previously of the dignity and  respect that must be afforded to the deceased and their families. Several years  ago, the outcome of the human organs inquiry was instrumental in bringing about  improved communication and greater consideration of the wishes of the family.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although we are discussing the unfortunate events that took  place after Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s death, it is important to emphasise two matters.  First, her death was a result of natural causes and, secondly, there has never  been any question about the quality of the medical care that she received while  she was in hospital. When I met members of the McGinley family in February,  they told me that they were content that their mother had been well cared for  in Altnagelvin Hospital during the period of her short  illness.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It would be useful to set out the background to the case  and to detail the actions of the trust staff up to the time when the coroner  directed that a post-mortem was to be carried out. Mrs McGinley was admitted to  Altnagelvin Hospital after suffering a fall at home,  and she sadly died on the evening of 3 January 2007 in the hospital. Following  her death, care of her body was provided by hospital staff in accordance with  the trust&rsquo;s guidelines for dealing with death certification and the care that  is required immediately following death. Investigations into the matter by Altnagelvin Hospital and the Coroners Office have  indicated that the staff involved followed those protocols and treated Mrs  McGinley&rsquo;s body with the care and respect that would be expected.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the morning of 4 January 2007, the hospital reported Mrs  McGinley&rsquo;s death to the coroner, who advised that a post-mortem was required.  On 5 January 2007, Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s body was taken to Belfast City Mortuary for  the post-mortem by undertakers acting for the Coroners Service for Northern Ireland.  On 19 March 2007, the results of the post-mortem were notified to the family  and the hospital. To clear up the point that Mr Doherty raised, post-mortem  reports often take many weeks for completion. The time taken in this case was  not unusual, and there is no question of the report being held up for any particular  reason.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The deputy state pathologist, Dr Bentley, who carried out  the post-mortem, noted the following points in his report to Altnagelvin  Hospital: the autopsy revealed a total of 34 fractures, the vast majority of  which were sustained after death; the patient had marked osteoporosis; a large  number of post-mortem fractures are extremely unusual, even in the presence of  marked osteoporosis; it does not necessarily mean that the body was subjected  to rough handling; often undertakers transport a body on a stretcher with the  body secured by means of adjustable straps; and it is possible that, if the  strap across the chest had been applied tightly, it could cause those injuries.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The trust&rsquo;s chief executive immediately conducted an  internal investigation into the handling of Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s body in Altnagelvin Hospital, and that investigation  concluded that all handling and transfers of the body were carried out in  accordance with hospital protocols. On 23 March 2007, senior officials from Altnagelvin Hospital met members of the McGinley  family, their legal representatives and Pat Doherty MP MLA to discuss the  findings from the trust&rsquo;s investigation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In response to the family&rsquo;s continuing concerns, the trust  wrote to the coroner to ask whether he would undertake an independent review of  practices in the organisations that had responsibility for the body from the  time of Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s death until it was returned to the family. The coroner  agreed to undertake such an investigation and to report its findings to the  trust.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Under direction from the coroner, PSNI officers conducted  the necessary inquiries, and I am advised that all those who came into contact  with Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s body were identified and interviewed, and statements were  taken from them. I am also advised that, having reviewed that evidence, the  coroner concluded that it was not possible to establish how Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s  fractures had been sustained. The Coroners Service made no recommendations to  the trust about its procedures for handling and moving bodies in the hospital  after her death.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In February 2008, when I met the McGinley family, I  undertook to establish with the trust the train of events up to and after Mrs  McGinley&rsquo;s death. The trust&rsquo;s chief executive supplied me with a detailed  account of the care that was provided to Mrs McGinley and, specifically,  clarification on the care of her body after death. In response to a key  question that Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s family raised, the chief executive confirmed that  Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s body had not been washed. However, before being moved to the  mortuary until it could be released to the undertakers, the body was checked by  a member of the nursing staff to ensure that it was clean. Having received that  information, I confirm that I am satisfied that the trust acted appropriately  in this case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the Assembly understand that the  circumstances of the matter extend beyond my Depart&shy;ment&rsquo;s remit. The Coroners  Service for Northern Ireland  operates within the Northern Ireland Court Service, which is the Lord  Chancellor&rsquo;s responsibility in Northern    Ireland. The administration of the Coroners  Service is not a devolved matter. The coroner, who is an independent judicial  officer, is responsible for directing that a body be brought to a suitable  place for post-mortem, and for making the necessary arrangements for the body&rsquo;s  transportation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am advised that the coroner directed Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s body  to be held for post-mortem on the morning of 4 January 2007, and I emphasise  that, from the point at which the coroner took charge of the body,  responsibility for its handling and transport became a matter for the coroner.  Therefore, I am not in a position to comment on events that occurred after  that. For example, I can comment neither on the body&rsquo;s handling by the under&shy;takers  who were acting for the coroner nor on the body&rsquo;s transfer from Altnagelvin to Belfast for post-mortem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There have been two thorough investigations into this tragic  case, and, in both instances, no definitive answer has been found as to how  those fractures occurred. Moreover, the coroner&rsquo;s review &mdash; conducted at the  trusts request &mdash; was an independent investigation that police officers  conducted, acting under the coroner&rsquo;s direction.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, each member of the hospital staff who came into  contact with Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s body was identified and interviewed, and a  statement was taken. That investigation&rsquo;s independence should help to provide  the necessary assurances that the trust&rsquo;s role has been scrutinised  effectively.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for a &ldquo;time-bound public inquiry&rdquo;. Some  people who are calling for a public inquiry into this case, and into other  cases, assert that such an inquiry can be time bound. That is not possible &mdash; no  one can put a time limit on justice &mdash; and any public inquiry must be free to  investigate and examine matters fully and appropriately. It is a  well-established principle here and in the rest of the UK that public  inquiries should be called only in exceptional circumstances &mdash; circumstances in  which no other investigatory mechanism would be sufficient.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In that respect, we must consider whether a public inquiry  would be justified on the grounds that the matter in question gives rise to a  nationwide crisis of confidence or involves the loss of many lives. In my  opinion, this matter would not meet those criteria.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If I thought that a public inquiry was appropriate and  would help provide the answer as to why Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s body sustained so many  fractures following &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Will the  Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Yes, I will. Allow me to finish  this sentence, and I will happily give way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If I thought that a public inquiry was appropriate and  would help to provide the answer as to why Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s body sustained so  many fractures following her death, I would not hesitate to hold one.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: First, if  the fact that a body sustained 34 fractures to the ribs after death is not of  the greatest importance, what circumstance would allow for the holding of a  public inquiry? Secondly, how can the Minister accept that what happened was an  accident when we appear not to know how the accident happened? On what does he  base that comment?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I do not remember talking about  an accident; I did not use the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo;. I follow the guidance on  whether a public inquiry should be held, which states that a public inquiry  should be held if the matter in question gives rise to a nationwide crisis of  confidence and/or involves the loss of many lives. If there is no overwhelming  reason to hold the inquiry in public, the next step is to consider whether a  departmental review inquiry or an independent private inquiry with a full  published report would be appropriate. The coroner effectively conducted an  independent inquiry, with a full published report. Therefore, I have followed  the guidelines in that respect &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> A  Member is talking at me from a sedentary position. This is a very serious  matter. I never mentioned the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo;. If I could find a way to  determine how those injuries occurred, I would take steps to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The family have asked an independent expert, Professor  Christopher Milroy, to conduct an inquiry on their behalf. The trust will  co-operate fully with the professor, as, I understand, will the coroner. I am  aware that the coroner has asked the family to share the outcome of Professor  Milroy&rsquo;s investigation with him. If that investigation reaches a different  conclusion from that of the coroner, I expect to be advised should any further  actions be considered regarding the role of Health Service staff in this  matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand and sympathise fully with the family&rsquo;s  situation and their desire to establish the circumstances that led to their  mother&rsquo;s body sustaining those fractures. I have been assured that there have  been rigorous efforts to investigate the matter fully. I have already set out  that there has been a trust investigation and that the coroner has conducted an  independent investigation. In addition, I have received a detailed account from  the trust of the events surrounding Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s death, following my meeting  with the family and Pat Doherty.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: This matter is very serious. Perhaps I have taken the Minister up  wrong, but he seems to suggest that if the inquiry that the family members have  asked to be conducted on their behalf &mdash; as is their prerogative &mdash; is  successful, there might be a public inquiry. Surely the onus is on the state to  investigate, not the individual?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: Mrs McGinley was, to all intents and purposes, in the care of the  state. Surely we cannot say to a family that an inquiry will be held if they  can prove that there is a reason to hold one? Surely the time has come for the  Government and those responsible to say that allowing that situation to arise  sets a very dangerous precedent for others?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close, because his time is almost  up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: I will, Mr Speaker. The Minister should consider the point that I  have put to him.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I will allow the Minister a quick response.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As I said, none of the investigations  found evidence that Health Service staff had acted inappropriately.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I have taken account of the mood of the House, and  I have listened to Dr Paisley and others. As I said to Pat Doherty and to the  family, I will leave no stone unturned. I will, of course, keep the matter  under review and consideration. I am not saying that there will never be a  public inquiry or that I am ruling out such an inquiry. The point that Dr  Paisley just made is a telling one.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Health,  Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs <strong>O&rsquo;Neill)</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I extend my personal condolences to the family of Maureen  McGinley and welcome the members of the family who have come today to listen to  the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend my colleagues on the Committee for Health, Social  Services and Public Safety for tabling the motion, and I thank everyone who has  contributed to the debate. Dr Kieran Deeny, who is a member of the Committee  and who has been very supportive of calls for an inquiry, apologises for not  being able to take part in the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Rev Dr Robert Coulter said that it was regrettable that  it was necessary to bring the issue before the House in the first place. I  fully agree with him. The fact that this lady sustained so many fractures after  she died is a matter that cries out for investigation, answers and justice.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If there had been only one or two fractures, there may have  been a straightforward explanation as to how they had been sustained. However,  such a large number of fractures to a specific part of the body &mdash; the ribcage &mdash;  could not have happened without someone knowing. The pathologist&rsquo;s report  states that it is extremely unusual to see so many post-mortem fractures, even  in the presence of marked osteoporosis. That would strongly suggest that, at  some point during the handling or moving of the body, considerable force was  applied to the chest. The family are entitled to an explanation, and I fully  support them in their campaign for answers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The McGinley family have been unable to grieve properly  because of a lack of openness and transparency about how their mother received  those fractures. There are several serious concerns about the case. Many of  those concerns were raised during the debate, and I will draw attention to a  number of them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is the question of delay. Mrs McGinley died in Altnagelvin Hospital on 3 January 2007. Her post-mortem  examination was carried out two days later on 5 January. However, despite the  discovery during the autopsy that this lady had suffered 34 unexplained rib  fractures after her death, it was more than 10 weeks later before that news was  communicated to the family and, apparently, to the hospital. The question must  be asked: when was the pathologist&rsquo;s report produced, and to whom was it sent?  That delay was highlighted by a number of Members today. We are all very aware  of it, and we need answers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Papers that the family have shared with me indicate that  the chief executive of the Western Health and Social Care Trust was made aware  of the matter on 19 March 2007. The trust states that there was no record of  the post-mortem examination report having been received before that date. A  letter from the deputy state pathologist to the hospital, dated 22 March,  confirmed the autopsy findings. The delay in starting that investigation could  have proved crucial in getting to the bottom of this affair and getting more of  the answers that the McGinley family deserve.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a result, the in-house investigation by the trust began  only in March, and subsequent statements by the PSNI were not taken until April  and May 2007. Those statements show that many of the people who were  interviewed claimed to have only a limited recollection of the events  surrounding the aftermath of Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s death.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members raised the issue of the washing of the  body. There is conflicting evidence about whether Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s body was  washed before being moved to the mortuary. The critical incident report that  was prepared by the hospital shows that at approximately 8.00 pm on 3 January,  a nursing auxiliary, among other procedures, washed the body and prepared it  for the mortuary. However, the investigating police officer was subsequently  advised that the body was not washed after death. Will the Minister tell the  family which version is correct? The Minister said today that checks were made  to see whether the body was cleaned. However, there is conflicting evidence  that a statement was made saying that the body was cleaned. Which is correct?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although we are discussing something that happened in less  than 48 hours &mdash; that is, between the time of Mrs McGinley&rsquo;s death and the  beginning of the autopsy &mdash; responsibility for the care of her body during that  time moved between two different legal entities. In the Chairperson&rsquo;s opening  remarks, she drew attention to that fact, as did other Members. At the time of  the incident, however, we were under direct rule. As Parliamentary  Under-Secretary of State, Paul Goggins MP was responsible for justice matters,  including the Coroners Service, and he was also the Minister with  responsibility for health, social services and public safety, so he had responsibility  for the body when it was in the charge of the hospital.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That situation changed only with the restoration of devolution.  The subsequent split of responsibilities cannot be used as an excuse for  refusing to hold an inquiry, and the Committee does not accept it as an excuse.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The devastating news of the unexplained fractures to Mrs  McGinley&rsquo;s body shocked the family and caused untold additional trauma to them  as they were beginning to come to terms with her death. It also caused  widespread public shock and concern, so much so that 18,500 people signed a  petition calling for an inquiry to be held to establish the truth.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  The fact that 18,500 people signed a petition cannot be ignored. So far, every  political party has supported the call for a public inquiry for social justice  for the McGinley family. Surely that should be sufficient criteria on which to  initiate a time-bound inquiry.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>:  I thank the Member for her intervention, and I could not agree more. The fact  that 18,500 people signed a petition speaks for itself. The petition was  presented to members of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public  Safety in February 2008. As other Members stated, the Minister initially  refused to meet the family but subsequently did so on 25 February. At that  meeting, the Minister assured the family that he would do everything in his  power to establish what happened to their mother. Since then, the family have  been deeply disappointed by the Minister&rsquo;s refusal to set up an inquiry. That  disappointment is shared by the Committee and by most Members of the House,  including Thomas Buchanan, Pat Doherty and others.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members also referred to the fact that the family recently  appointed an independent expert &mdash; Professor Milroy &mdash; to examine the case. I  welcome the indication from the Coroners Service that it will co-operate fully  with Professor Milroy. Furthermore, I welcome the indication from the Minister  that the trust will also co-operate with him.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Dr Paisley said, it is a poor indictment on everyone  involved that the family must wait on the result of Professor Milroy&rsquo;s inquiry  before anyone else will take notice of their plight.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister referred to the hospital staff, but the family  are not interested in conducting a witch-hunt, and nor do they want any member  of staff to feel intimidated. In fact, they have said that the standard of care  that their mother received at the hospital was excellent prior to her death.  However, the family need answers to the situation that occurred after her  death. As Claire McGill stated in her contribution, the healthcare staff also  need answers to what happened. They also need the confusion to be cleared up.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is disappointing that the Minister has come here today  and simply reiterated what we already knew. We are all aware of the facts, but  we have heard nothing new today. The Minister said that no definitive answers  have been found after two thorough examinations. Is that acceptable to the  McGinley family? Would any Member here accept that if the same thing were to  happen to a member of their family?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister also said that the rules for conducting a  public inquiry mean that it is not appropriate in this case. However, the fact  that 18,500 people signed a petition makes it clear that this is a cause of  widespread public concern, as has been highlighted by many Members today. It is  an issue of great public concern and answers must be provided.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Does the  Member agree that people will not have confidence in a trust carrying out its  own investigation? Policing oneself always raises question marks, which is why  an independent inquiry should be conducted.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>:  Absolutely, I could not agree more. The only answer to the situation is to  conduct a full public inquiry that is time bound.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, the Committee for Health, Social Services  and Public Safety believes that the matter can be resolved satisfactorily only  through a full public inquiry, when everyone who is involved can be questioned  under oath. Everyone who spoke during the debate supported the call for an  inquiry, and I hope that that has given some support and encouragement to the  members of the McGinley family who are in the Public Gallery today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The reasons offered by the Minister today are not  sufficient to refuse a public inquiry. The Committee still firmly believes that  an inquiry is the only way that the McGinley family will get the answers that  they deserve and that will allow them to get on with grieving for their mother.  We will continue to do all that we can to assist the family in their quest for  answers. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses concern that investigations by  the Western Health and Social Care Trust and the Coroner&rsquo;s Service have failed  to provide a satisfactory explanation of the circumstances in which the late  Mrs Maureen McGinley received a number of fractures following her death;  commends the family of Mrs Maureen McGinley for their campaign in highlighting  the issue; and calls on the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety to initiate, as a matter of urgency, a full, independent and time-bound  public inquiry.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="9"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Irish-Medium   Primary School</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10  minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to speak will  have five minutes. I wish to inform Members that a valid petition of concern  about the motion was presented on Monday 23 June. I therefore remind Members  that the effect of the petition is that the vote on the motion will be on a  cross-community basis.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses concern at the refusal by the  Minister of Education to consider proposals for new Controlled, Maintained and  Integrated schools, whilst approving a plan for a new Irish Medium Primary  School in Derry/Londonderry, despite advice from officials in the Department  that there was already adequate capacity in this sector.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Speaker. I notice that the Minister of Education is not in  the House for the debate. Is it appropriate for the debate to begin while the  Minister is not here to listen to the case being made? Has the Minister given  you notice that she was not going to be in the Chamber or given a reason why  she was not going to be here?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I thank the Member for his point of order. I have had no notification that the  Minister will be late. Nevertheless, we shall carry on with the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I will begin by expressing my disappointment that the SDLP has signed a  petition of concern about the motion. I hope that after hearing the reasoning  behind the motion, the Members of that party will reconsider their position and  support it. I expect no less of the Sinn F&eacute;in Members than to blindly follow  the lead of their Minister, even though it is a case of the blind leading the  blind.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The first, and largest, Irish-medium school in the city  which, in the absence of any talent in Irish, I will call the Shantallow  school, initially operated as an Irish-medium unit in the adjoining Steelstown  Primary School for 10 years, before moving to its present site in 1993. At its  peak, it had 228 pupils enrolled. However, since the second Irish-medium school  opened in 1998, which I will refer to as the Brandywell school, enrolments have  fallen dramatically. A total of 159 pupils were enrolled in the 2007-08 academic  year. The Brandywell school currently has 135 pupils enrolled. There has been a  general increase in numbers since 1998, but the school has never reached full  capacity. In 2006-07, however, only 14 pupils enrolled in year 1.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">According to the Department of Education&rsquo;s own figures in  August 2007, the two existing schools had an estimated 135 surplus places. One  hundred and six of those places were in the Shantallow school. In August 2007,  the Minister of Education decided to approve a new Irish-language school,  situated less than three miles from the other two schools. I will call that  third school the Springtown school. That approval overturned the decision of  the direct rule Minister who had decided against funding only a year before,  claiming that there was:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;significant surplus capacity at the nearest  Irish-medium primary school&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That, of course, was true then, and remains true  today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For the benefit of the Assembly I will read out the  Department&rsquo;s policy on Irish-medium education. Its general policy is to support  such provision: where it is satisfied that there is significant demand from  parents, which means minimum intakes of 15 pupils in an urban area and 12  pupils in a rural area; where there is no suitable alternative provision within  reasonable travelling distance; where it would be educationally sound and viable  to provide it; where there would be no unreasonable outlay of public funds;  where the new school should have no adverse impact on any other existing school  in the area; where the new school should be located on a suitable site and in  suitable accommodation; and, where there have been no serious objections to the  proposal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I stressed the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; because it is an extremely  important word in the Department&rsquo;s policy. It means that all the points of the  policy must be satisfied. It does not mean that the Minister can pick and  choose which points she can follow and which she can choose to ignore.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In her press release of 8 August 2007, when she announced  funding for three Irish-medium schools, including the third school in Londonderry, the Minister said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In recent years we have seen increasing demand from  parents to have their children educated through the medium of Irish. This is  significant at a time when we see an overall fall in the numbers of children in  our schools.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Apparently, that fall in numbers included enrolments at the  Irish-medium school in Shantallow. In fact, the Department&rsquo;s figures state that  there has been a fall of 35% in year-1 enrolments, taking the Shantallow and  Brandywell schools together. Even taking into account the 16 year-1 pupils in  the Springtown school, there would still be a 20% fall in year-1 enrolments.  Yet the Minister persists in telling us that the sector is thriving.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has imposed the restriction that 15 pupils  must be enrolled in year 1 at the Springtown school. However, she has clearly  ignored many of the criteria in her Department&rsquo;s policy. The Shantallow school,  with its 106 spare places, is only 2&middot;5 miles from the Springtown site, and the  Brandywell school is only 2&middot;9 miles from it. Two undersubscribed Irish-medium  schools within three miles make for suitable alternative provision within  reasonable travelling distance. In addition, given the negative impact that the  opening of the Brandywell school in 1998 had on the Shantallow school, and the  continuing decline since then in that school&rsquo;s enrolments, it is more than  reasonable to conclude that either, or both, of those existing schools would be  adversely affected by grant-funding the Springtown school.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those two reasons alone should mean that any outlay of  public funds on the project would be unreasonable. However, we must also  consider the fact that there were serious objections to the proposal. The  Shantallow school and the Holy   Family Primary    School lodged objections to the proposal to  grant-fund the Springtown school. I wish that I had time to read out in full  the well-reasoned arguments that were made by the board of governors and staff  of the Shantallow school. I suggest that Members read that document, which is  dated 5 April 2007.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Not only does the document raise grave concerns about the  procedure adopted by the governing body of Irish-medium education in  recommending that the third school be opened &mdash; in particular, its total failure  to consult with the Shantallow school regarding the proposal &mdash; it also asks  extremely pertinent questions about the total lack of strategic planning for  Irish-medium education in Londonderry. The governors and staff point out that  there have not been enough significant changes in Irish-medium education in Londonderry since the proposal for the Springtown school  was rejected only a year before.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Part of the Minister&rsquo;s decision-making process included the  consideration of a planning application for 5,000 homes in the nearby  Ballymagroarty area. In her notes on the proposal she stated:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;there will be 5,000 new homes&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, at that time, planning permission for the  development had not been approved. All we know is that those homes are to be  built over the next 10 years. The Minister can have no notion of how many of  the residents of those houses would wish to send their children to an  Irish-medium school, let alone how many children might move into the area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister also referred to the pupils at Irish-medium  preschools. However, the Department pointed out that not all of those children  will go on to attend Irish-medium primary schools. It is also foreseeable that  the school population will fall by 23%. Even the most loyal advocates of  Irish-medium education must agree that opening a further Irish-medium school in  Londonderry is a gross waste of public money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, in March 2008, the Minister decided not to  allow Conlig Primary School to adopt integrated  status on the grounds that adequate provision existed in the area. Does she use  the guidelines only when it suits her? At that time she said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I must consider all the implications for the entire  schools&rsquo; estate in the area.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, she does not seem to have done that in Londonderry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If we examine the impact on maintained primary schools in  the area, there are 842 surplus capacity places, 244 of which are in Holy Family   Primary School, which is  less than one mile from the Springtown school. It has been recognised that Holy Family   Primary School will  potentially be affected by the grant-funding of the Springtown school.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Education and Training Inspectorate did not support the  Springtown proposal, as it believed that Irish-medium provision in the city had  reached saturation point. The Western Education and Library Board was concerned  that a further school was being proposed, given that there were already surplus  places at the other two schools, and given the effect of additional costs on a  stretched education budget. That board also pointed out that there needed to be  a coherent approach to primary-school provision and area-based planning.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the Minister will attempt to claim that the  motion is another DUP attack on the Irish-medium sector. It is not. In turning  down the proposal, the Minister not only ignored her Department&rsquo;s criteria on  grant funding of Irish-medium schools, but she ignored the recommendation of  the head of development and infrastructure in her Department. Not only did she  ignore the concise and well thought-out arguments of the governors and staff of  the Shantallow school, she ignored the principles of area-based planning.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The situation is another example of the Minister attempting  to run her Department as though it were her personal fiefdom. However, she must  realise that she is accountable. I urge all Members to join us in condemning  her actions. Furthermore, I ask Members to question the rationale of the  decisions &mdash; or the lack of decisions &mdash; that are being made on the schools that  are in their respective constituencies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is not an example of political point-scoring,  nor is it an attack on Irish-medium education. It is a recognition by this  legislature that the Minister has acted illogically, unreasonably and contrary  to her Department&rsquo;s policy and guidelines.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. That was an interesting presentation by the lady on  the opposite Benches. I am glad that she is not attacking the Irish language.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The name of the Irish-medium school in question, Gaelscoil  na Dar&oacute;ige, charms me greatly. Indeed, it is so fitting that, if I were the  Minister of Education, I would approve the school even if it had no pupils at  all. &ldquo;Dair&rdquo; is the Irish word for an oak tree, which gives its name to the county of Derry, or Doire. &ldquo;Dar&oacute;g&rdquo; is the Irish  term for a young oak tree. The school&rsquo;s name is fitting, and I am very taken by  it. Gaelscoil, of course, refers to a school where the Irish language is used.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Any community that wants a school and that can assure the  Department that it has 15 primary-1 pupils is entitled to funding for that  school. That is education policy &mdash; the school does not have to be an  Irish-medium, or any other medium, school. Funding has not been granted to  Gaelscoil na Dar&oacute;ige, but it has been approved, in principle, as a Gaelscoil.  It is hoped that the school will fulfil the relevant criteria. Indeed,  demographic information that has been gathered by Comhairle na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta  and others who work on behalf of the Irish language indicates clearly that the  school will fulfil the relevant criteria eventually.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The school is already operational and has been financed by  fundraising and voluntary subscription. The school already exists, so the  Minister is not creating it. Furthermore, it is not the Minister who drives the  creation of Irish-medium schools. I know that that drive comes from parents and  communities. I hope that very soon there will be a new Gaelscoil in L&eacute;im an  Mhadaidh, which is in my own constituency. We already have a na&iacute;scoil and a  Gaelscoil in Dungiven, which are both very successful.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Comhairle na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta has created a framework for  the future development of Irish-medium provision throughout the North. That  framework is based on meticulous analysis of the demographics and information  from the most recent census. Those statistics prove the viability of the future  creation of Irish-medium schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The building of more than one Irish-medium primary school  in a particular area is aimed at creating a catchment area of Irish-medium  pupils who will be fundamental to the creation of an Irish-medium post-primary  school in that area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are building up from na&iacute;scoil to bunscoil and on to  post-primary, and it is to be hoped that some day, somewhere, we will have an  Irish-medium university.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A third Gaelscoil in Derry  is viable and required. It is a big city, and the demographics of areas smaller  than Derry suggest that it could accommodate  several Irish-medium schools.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Why  does the Member think that a third school is viable, when the two existing  primary schools have spare capacity and cannot fill their places?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>: I  hope that the Member does not think that I am being too smart when I say that  one could say that of almost any school, in any medium, in the North of  Ireland. I am sure that the Minister is tired listening to the statistics about  the number of empty desks that there is.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Is my time up already, Mr Speaker?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  He has an extra minute.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>: I  have an extra minute. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. I cannot accept that the Member  who proposed the motion is not opposed to the Irish language. We are used to  that now, and I wish that the Members opposite would take a more mature look at  the beautiful language that is part of all that we have. The lady opposite was  reluctant to use the Irish names for places, but she said Shantallow, which  means &ldquo;old land&rdquo; &mdash; just as Shankill means &ldquo;old church&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I hope that it is not inappropriate for me to say that I always enjoy Mr  Brolly&rsquo;s speeches. They remind me of gentler times, when we did not have  problems with extended schools, numeracy and literacy, a lack of  qualifications, migrant workers and teacher training, as well as 50,000 empty school  spaces. Unfortunately, however, we have to deal with those issues and find a  way in which to resolve them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I notice that I have not yet engaged the attention of the  Minister who, some time ago, asked me to work with her. I am trying to work  with her now.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not surprising that the House is compelled to debate  another divisive act by the Minister of Education. It is regrettable that, once  again, the Minister of Education seems intent on sectarianising the education  debate. Once again, she has acted against the advice of her Department and put  partisan, sectoral interests above the need for good government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth noting that of the five petitions of concern  that have before the House, three have originated from the Minister of  Education&rsquo;s party. Its objective is to shield her from the majority opinion in  the Assembly. That demonstrates the Minister&rsquo;s refusal to work with the House  and the lack of confidence that the House has in her.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In recent times, I have heard a change in the mood music  about reaching consensus. If we are genuine in our desire to reach consensus,  people will have to take responsibility for their actions. We will work with  people who are genuine in their attempts to achieve good for all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the honourable Members who tabled the motion. The  debate will only emphasise the lack of confidence that exists, and it is to be  hoped that it will suggest to the Minister of Education that we must begin to  consider what the debate is about. It must be stated that the debate is not  about the Irish language. As a unionist who is committed to pluralism and the  diversity of the United    Kingdom, and one who is mindful of the  protections granted in the Belfast Agreement, I have no hesitation in affirming  the freedom of those who wish to use the Irish language to do so. Nor do I  hesitate in affirming that Irish-medium units in schools can play a role in a  pluralist education system, and I am open to persuasion on the relative merits  of exclusively Irish-medium schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, I am even using a green highlighter on my  notes. None of that matters for today&rsquo;s debate.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What is being debated is the specific action taken by the  Minister to approve a new Irish-medium school in Londonderry  against the advice of her Department&rsquo;s head of development and infrastructure  who stated:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;there are already sufficient IM primary school  places.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He noted &mdash; and I summarise &mdash; that the nearest  alternative Irish-medium school and the nearest maintained school had expressed  concerns about the proposals. He stated that in two Irish-medium schools the  numbers of pupils enrolling in year one had fallen by approximately 35% in the  past two years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It should be a matter of concern that the Education  Minister so blatantly disregarded the advice of her officials. Although it is  the case that a democratically elected representative can &mdash; in compelling  circumstances &mdash; disagree with the advice of officials, let it be remembered  that this is the same Education Minister who is forever telling us that there  are 50,000 empty desks and that we have to constrain the school estates to  manage that process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s unnecessary and unco-ordinated actions have  led to today&rsquo;s debate as, once again, she has sought the path of confrontation.  That is not good and fair government; it is partisan and sectional and does not  deliver for the common good of our society. I repeat: this is not a debate  about the Irish language and it is not a debate about parents choosing  Irish-medium education. As someone who believes firmly in the principles of  pluralism, I have no hesitation in accepting the role of both sectors.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Minister&rsquo;s actions have shamefully privileged  one section of the education system in Londonderry  at the expense of the controlled, maintained and integrated sectors &mdash;we cannot  support that; that does not represent a shared future. It is nothing less than  an Executive Minister refusing to serve the whole community, and I urge her to  reconsider. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an deis an t-&aacute;bhar  iontach t&aacute;bhachtach seo a phl&eacute; inniu, ach caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute; go bhfuil m&eacute; glan  in &eacute;adan an r&uacute;in at&aacute; os &aacute;r gcomhair.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to debate the issue; however, I  oppose the motion. Mr Brolly mentioned that Comhairle na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, the  body charged with the develop&shy;ment of Irish-medium education, has created a  framework for its future development throughout the North. That body is made up  of highly professional educationalists who know what they are doing. The  framework that Comhairle na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta has developed &mdash; and I have examined  it &mdash; is based on a detailed analysis of future demographic trends and  information from the recent census. The purpose of that framework is to co-ordinate  with parents and communities and to provide a guide for the development of  Irish-medium education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The framework aims to guide parents by creating new  provision in a strategic manner whereby children who have attended Irish-medium  primary schools will, in the future, have the realistic option and opportunity  of post-primary Irish-medium education. The guidance ensures that access to  Irish-medium education is optimised and that new provision does not undermine  existing provision &mdash; that is a very important point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The analysis information indicates that there is sufficient  demand for Irish-medium education in Derry   City and demand for at  least a third Gaelscoil. Further&shy;more, that extra provision is required to  broaden access to Irish-medium education throughout all those communities in Derry City  in which it does not currently exist. Other smaller areas in the North, as Mr  Brolly pointed out, have equal provision.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also important to ensure that more than one or two  primary schools exist in a region in order to sustain a viable post-primary  facility there. It is important to note that funding has not yet been granted  to Gaelscoil na Dar&oacute;ige as it has not yet met the Department of Educat&shy;ion&rsquo;s  funding criteria. Comhairle na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta has told me that it supports the  development of the new pre-school and primary-school provision in Derry on the condition that the school meets those  criteria. The development is consistent with the Irish-medium sector framework  for development devised by Comhairle na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The majority of children attending Gaelscoil na Dar&oacute;ige &mdash;  and those who will attend it in the future &mdash; would not otherwise avail  themselves of Irish-medium provision because of where they live. The existing  Irish-medium schools in Derry will not be  adversely affected by the Department&rsquo;s approval for Gaelscoil na Dar&oacute;ige for  two reasons: first, the existing schools do not draw large numbers of pupils  from that particular area; and secondly, the interested children already attend  a non-funded school.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to note that the number of children  entering Irish-medium education in Derry has  risen since 2000. Currently, 66 pupils are entering Irish-medium provision  across the city each year. That figure is expected to continue to grow as the  number of children in pre-school provision increases. There are two funded  Irish-medium primary schools in the city &mdash; Bunscoil Cholmcille and Gaelscoil  &Eacute;adain Mh&oacute;ir. Gaelscoil na Dar&oacute;ige is unfunded. There are 303 pupils in  Irish-medium primary provision in the three schools, which is an increase of 27  on 2006.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I fully support Gaelscoil na Dar&oacute;ige and reject the motion.  If the process of area-based planning centred on the sustainable schools policy  were still in place, we would probably not be having this debate today.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: The  Alliance Party agrees with the concern expressed in the motion and with the  criticism of the Minister&rsquo;s decision to allow the establishment of another  Irish-medium primary school in Londonderry.  However, we do not think that the wording of the motion, accusing the Minister  of refusing to consider proposals for schools in other sectors, is accurate. My  party also has concerns about the treatment of Irish-medium applications as  opposed to those from the integrated sector. We agree with the broad thrust of  the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All the arguments that I have heard about the situation in Derry indicate that the decision to allow Gaelscoil na  Dar&oacute;ige flies in the face of the Department&rsquo;s guidelines for the establishment  of a new school. The general policy &mdash; as outlined by Michelle McIlveen &mdash; is to  support new provision where there is no suitable alternative provision within  reasonable travelling distance, and where it would be educationally sound and  viable to provide it. Evidence of parental demand and a minimum intake are also  factors, as is the fact that there should not be any serious objections to the  proposal in general.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The board of governors of Bunscoil Cholmcille have  expressed an unequivocal view that the proposal does not represent an effective  addition to Irish-medium provision. The statement made by the board of  governors, which Miss McIlveen quoted from, states:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is neither sustainable nor prudent to propose the  establishment of a third Irish Medium primary school at this time whilst  current providers have considerable spare capacity and particularly in the  light of the fact that the roll number of Bunscoil Cholmcille has been in  significant decline since the establishment of a second primary level  provider.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The pupil enrolment in that school has fallen 39%  since the establishment of the Gaelscoil &Eacute;adain Mh&oacute;ir nine years ago.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Has there been a sufficient increase in demand for  Irish-language education in Londonderry to  make up for the effect of spreading the existing enrolment over three sites  instead of two? It does not seem like it. The existing schools have a large  number of surplus places, and they are objecting to the proposal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Is it beneficial or detrimental to the cause of  Irish-language provision to have three half-empty schools in the city? It seems  detrimental. I quote a line from the statement by the other school:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The actual effect of establishing a second provider  &hellip;nine years ago has been to distract from the work and development of Irish  Medium...&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Education and Training Inspectorate is also  against the proposal; it considers Bunscoil Cholmcille and Gaelscoil &Eacute;adain  Mh&oacute;ir to be more than adequate for present and foreseeable needs. Therefore, it  is hard to escape the conclusion that the reason that the proposal has received  ministerial approval is that it is for Irish-medium education and that the  Minister has a special affection for that movement. I look forward to her  response at the close of the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I reiterate my party&rsquo;s support for both the Irish-medium  and integrated sectors &mdash; one of which is prioritised in the Programme for  Government and the other is not mentioned. I could point to situations &mdash; for  example, in Ballycastle and the Clogher Valley, where funding for integrated  schools was refused, even though, on the face of it, both cases were strong &mdash;  and compare them to the situation that we are now considering, which appears to  fail almost all the tests that the Department has set. I doubt that this school  can be viable except at the expense of the existing providers, and I look  forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s reasons for her decision.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members know, the education budget is stretched, and we  are having difficulty in finding money for very worthy projects. There is no  scope for funding anything that is unnecessary, and a third Irish-medium school  appears to be unnecessary. If there is an explanation for this, I look forward  to hearing it; for now, however, the Alliance Party supports the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  like to ensure clarity and that people know exactly where I stand on an issue.  I do not now speak as Chairperson of the Education Committee but as a Member  for the greatest constituency in the world North Antrim.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that the Minister is at last in the House.  Although if we are to believe media speculation, it may be one of the last  debates in which she will occupy the post of Education Minister. I wonder which  of her colleagues will finally wield the knife against her. Whoever that may  be, we may be sure that that individual will either bin McGuinness&rsquo;s proposals  or oversee the employment of academic admissions criteria in defiance of the  present Education Minister and with the full backing of the law. Those are the  realities; those are the facts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Regrettably, the Education Minister has come to be known,  and rightly so, as the minister of delay and confusion. In recent days, she has  tried to change that &mdash; with remarkable success: she is now known as the minister  for embarrassing climbdowns. We saw the most recent in today&rsquo;s &lsquo;Newsletter&rsquo;.  Under close questioning by my friend and colleague Mr Stephen Moutray, one of  her officials conceded that if there is no agreement on a new transfer system:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The department will be able to issue guidance, but it  will not have the force of law. In this situation, schools will be able to set  their own admissions criteria, including the use of ability as a criterion&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Where are the Minister&rsquo;s denials? Where are her  threats? They are lying face down in the sand.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Why should I say all that in a debate about Irish-medium  schools? This Minister has pursued a narrow, sectarian, ideological approach to  the future of our children. In her major policy on post-primary transfer, she  has been thwarted and is powerless, as is admitted publicly by her own  officials in today&rsquo;s press. What does she do in those circumstances? She tries  to advance her sectarianism in smaller, bite-sized chunks in Irish-medium  schools: little sectarian niblets for the Minister. That is why she made this  decision, which is in defiance of her Department&rsquo;s policy on Irish-medium  education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the opening remarks of my colleague &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  To get an extra minute, I certainly will.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bradley</strong>:  Why does the Member use the word &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; in reference to Irish-medium  schools? Is he not aware that Irish-medium schools develop pupils spiritually,  emotionally, physically, intellectually and linguistically? In fact, pupils  educated in Irish-medium schools have the added value of being competent in two  languages. Indeed, members of my family who are not Catholics attend  Irish-medium schools, and they do not find them to be sectarian. In fact, they  find those schools to be open and welcoming.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  It is sad that I must educate the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for  Education. If he had listened and was interested in the arguments expressed  from this side of the Chamber, he would have realised that I was referring to  the Minister as being sectarian &mdash; not the Irish-medium sector.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Will the Member not agree that there are other forms of sectarianism, such as  cultural sectarianism and political sectarianism, in addition to religious  sectarianism, and that those are the types of sectarianism espoused by the  Minister of Education?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Member for that, and I agree entirely with what he has said.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption].</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Why did the Minister take the decision to provide further  Irish-medium places in Londonderry? Did the Minister make the decision based on  the best possible information available to her? Did she make the decision in  the best interests of those parents who chose an Irish-medium education for  their children? She did not. She made the decision purely to feed her own  particular ideology and to feed the ideology of the backwoodsmen in Sinn F&eacute;in.  Those backwoodsmen need something, because it is clear that they have received little  from the process to date, and that they are concerned about the process being  undertaken in this House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley, in his press release, accused my party of  waging war on the Irish language. That is not so. It is the Minister of  Education who is seeking to wage war with the Irish language, and, in the  process, has ensured that it is more divisive to the unionist community, and  more negatively viewed and regarded with a greater aversion by it. Dominic  Bradley and the SDLP know that and that is why they know that members of Sinn  F&eacute;in are, by their behaviour, the biggest enemies to Irish-speaking schools in  Northern Ireland. Mr Bradley must realise that he cannot pick and choose when  he decides to oppose the Minister of Education &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  will return to this at a later stage.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: Go  raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. There are three reasons for the  debate today. The debate is entirely bogus and is part of the ongoing attack by  some in this Chamber on the work of the Minister of Education. First of all,  this is simply another crude reaction by those who are against the crucial  reform of our outdated education system. The concern on the Benches opposite is  not for the thousands of mainly working-class children who are failed every  year by that system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, this motion reflects the degree of irrational  hostility that there is amongst some on the Benches opposite to the Irish  language, to Irish-language speakers and to children who are taught through the  medium of the Irish language.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, some Members &mdash; and I include the Member for  Strangford in this &mdash; feel that they need to pretend that they are in charge of  those Irish-medium institutions and that they can stop a Sinn F&eacute;in Minister  from fulfilling her duties. They have chosen the education of our children &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Speaker. I wonder whether you could rule whether it is  appropriate &mdash; in the context of the dress code for this House &mdash; for the Member  to be delivering a speech without wearing a tie. I believe that that is in  contravention of the dress code.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  It is perfectly all right for the Member to do so, and that is not really a  point of order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: It  is interesting that Members opposite &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The issue of dress code relates to jackets, not so much to ties. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: I  did not think that dress codes, men, and the party opposite mixed, but there  you go.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">They have chosen the education of children as an issue on  which to contest this matter and, consequently, they are bringing these  institutions into disrepute. They are making, i mo bhar&uacute;il f&eacute;in, a huge  mistake.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The future of these institutions is based on the ability of  all parties to work together for the common good &mdash; to make necessary  compromises and agreements based on equality and inclusivity. That is the only  way these institutions will survive. Therefore, the Members opposite have a  choice &mdash; march backwards into meltdown and failure, or forwards to deliver for  citizens on pressing problems in the areas of health, education, the  environment, the economy and planning.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A chairde, this is the fourth debate in a year about the  education of a relatively small number of children &mdash; 3,000 out of a school  population of 350,000. Parents, teachers and others deserve credit for there  being so many in what is the fastest-growing sector in our education system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the education of children through Irish is not a  threat. The Irish language is not a threat to unionism or to anyone else.  Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane is working very hard to ensure that no child is placed at a  disadvantage, that no child is abandoned or denied &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, the Member has the floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>:  The Minister is ensuring that no child is denied the education opportunity to  meet his or her full potential.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">She is effectively defending all sections of the education  system, including the controlled, maintained, integrated and Irish-language  sectors. She is also bringing forward necessary reforms of the education  system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All of us understand the concerns that exist, particularly  among parents who are worried about decisions that they will have to take in an  education environment that is undergoing a long-overdue overhaul. Those concerns  are being exploited by those who are against education reform and the Irish  language, and, in particular, by those who have their own narrow supremacist  agenda in this institution.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the lack of a sustainable schools policy, as part of  area-based planning, means that there is a lack of guidance on the future of  the schools estate? Does the absence of such a policy not give others, like the  Members opposite, the opportunity to attack the development of sectors, including  the Irish-medium sector?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: N&iacute;  aonta&iacute;m leatsa. I do not agree.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s commitment is to every child. We are about  making every school a good school, and providing the best possible education  for every child. The Education Minister is showing great leadership in charting  a difficult course towards that objective. Her detractors and the other  begrudgers and naysayers would do well to follow her example. They can do that  best by putting first the interest of all our children, including those who are  being educated through the Irish language. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann  Comhairle.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Perhaps Mr Adams is not wearing a tie today because he has got a new job as a  runner and he needs to keep the air moving around him.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is good to take part in this debate. We are debating a  subject relating to a Minister who has ignored her Department&rsquo;s advice in  reaching a decision. This is a Minister who often talks about equality, but  here we see demonstrated once again that equality is not applied when it comes  to her office. She clearly puts Irish-language schools first, the maintained  and integrated sector next, and controlled schools bottom of the pile. Once and  for all, the Education Minister must put her house in order and start to treat  all children fairly and equally. Rather than pay lip service to equality, she  should actually apply it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us look at the policy on this. It states that there  should be no suitable alternative provision within a reasonable travelling  distance. Well, there is, because Bunscoil Cholmcille is only 2&middot;5 miles away  and has 106 surplus places. The policy states that it should be &ldquo;educationally  sound and viable&rdquo; to provide funding &mdash; it is not &mdash; and that there should be &ldquo;no  unreasonable outlay of public funds&rdquo;. There will be an unreasonable outlay of  public funds.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is claimed that the new school should have no adverse  impact on any other existing school in the area; however, it will have, because  there are already two Irish-medium schools with 135 surplus places. It is also  claimed that there should be no serious objections to the proposals, but  serious objections have come from schools in the Irish-medium, controlled and  maintained sectors. Therefore, the Minister is flying in the face of six of the  eight policies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was interested to hear Mr Dominic Bradley say that the  Irish-language sector is growing in Londonderry and the wider council area.  That is strange, because the document that is provided to the Minister does not  say that. That document says that, over the past two years, there has been a  35% fall in the intake of the two Irish-medium schools in the area, schools  that the Department of Education funds.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I know the consequences of ignoring that type of advice,  because, in my constituency, Rowandale Integrated Primary School was opened  last year, despite the fact that it had been turned down the previous year and  that three brand new schools with a significant capacity had been built in that  area. It also faced competition from an integrated school some miles away. This  year, it is proposed to close that integrated school because another integrated  school is to open a few miles up the road.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We face a situation in which another Irish-language school  is to open, which will affect the enrolment figures of the two existing  Irish-language schools. The consequence of that will be that those schools will  come under further pressure, and more demand will be placed on the Northern  Ireland Budget and the Northern Ireland taxpayer to support those schools, because  they will not have enough pupils to sustain them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister must put her house in order and start to make  decisions that are based on what is best for children.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the best thing that could be done for the children  of Northern Ireland would be to remove the current Minister of Education and  replace her with someone who is competent and unbiased? <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  That may seem a good idea, but I am sure that the SDLP would strenuously oppose  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s removing the most unpopular Minister in the Government and the most  unpopular Minister that the party has. Minister Ruane is a vehicle for passing  votes from Sinn F&eacute;in to the SDLP. If Sinn F&eacute;in is content to keep her, that is  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s problem. Unfortunately, she brings a bad name to the entire  Northern Ireland Government, because of the inequality that she practises when  carrying out her job. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  fully understand the problem that Mr Adams has in replacing the Minister,  because of the lack of talent on the Bench opposite. Perhaps that is why he is  stuck with Minister Ruane, who has repeatedly failed to deliver in her  Department. Ms Ruane must now take decisions that are in the best interests of  schools and children, and stop making decisions that are neither based on  equality and fairness nor on the wider interests of education.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I will state at the outset, lest we be accused of being bullies or bigots, that  neither I nor my colleagues have any wish to deny parents their right to  educate their children in the manner that they wish, through the medium that  they choose, providing that no other child is disadvantaged as a result, given  the finite nature of the education budget. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Members should not try to debate across the Chamber. Continue, Mr  Robinson.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. Do I get an extra minute for that interjection?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the first mandate of the Assembly, the  Irish-language lobby group held a meeting in this Building &mdash; if I remember  correctly, it was held in room 135 &mdash; to explain its raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre. I recall  clearly that two members of the Ulster Unionist Party attended that meeting &mdash;  Mr Alan McFarland and I. We listened carefully, and we outlined how education  in the Irish language was viewed by our community.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past 10 years, much progress has been made in the  Irish-medium sector. However, it is regrettable that instead of building on the  excellent Irish-speaking units in the schools that are under Council for  Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) control, greater emphasis has been given to  the establishment of separate schools and a separate sector. Building on the existing  units would have brought lasting benefits to the provision of education through  the medium of Irish. It would also have reduced the sense of exclusion and  separateness and supported the Irish-language units in an existing and vibrant  education sector. It would have nullified the widely held perception that the  Irish language had been hijacked for political reasons, rather than linguistic  and cultural ones, and it would have negated the need to establish another specific  sector in the education world, with its associated administrative costs and  inevitable bureaucracy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The emergence of the current Minister of Education, with  her pointed use of the Irish language in the House, despite time restraints,  and her use of restrictive English terminology, such as &ldquo;the North&rdquo;, has simply  reinforced the perception here and in wider society that the Irish language has  been wrested from those who love and cherish it and has been transformed into  the entity that has led to today&rsquo;s divisive debate. The current situation with  the existing 11 Irish-medium units in the Catholic-maintained schools and the  emerging 25 Irish-medium schools represents a lost opportunity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, if other sectors in the education world are  examined, the situation is different. Controlled schools &mdash; such as Knockbreda  Primary School and Conlig Primary School &mdash; that sought to transform to  grant-maintained integrated status, at the request of parents, were refused  permission.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency, parents in Island Magee were persuaded  to amalgamate three controlled schools in exchange for a new school on a new  identified site to cater for the island. However, the Minister has not given  that school-building programme the go ahead. Meanwhile, despite the advice of  her departmental officials and the concerns of neighbouring maintained and  Irish-medium schools, the Minister sanctioned a new Irish-medium school in  Londonderry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the one hand, we are lectured about the 50,000 empty  desks in our schools and the financial implications of that, and on the other  hand, the Minister presses ahead with a new school, despite her advisors and  inspectors highlighting the damage that it will cause existing schools. In the  absence of any rational argument for her actions, it is little wonder that many  in the Chamber, and beyond, question the safety of their children&rsquo;s education  in the Minister&rsquo;s hands. Due in no small part to her approach, I must support  the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Does the Member agree that for any group in a four-party mandatory coalition,  the key word is not &ldquo;four&rdquo; or &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; but &ldquo;coalition&rdquo;? Coalitions depend  upon building consensus, which is what the Minister of Education should try to  achieve.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I agree with my colleague Mr Basil McCrea&rsquo;s comments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for West Belfast Mr Gerry Adams lectured Members  on this side of the Chamber about lacking concern for children, particularly  those from working-class backgrounds. As someone who spent part of his  educational life in west and north Belfast, I take grave exception to that comment.  One reason for my opposition to the new Irish-medium school in Londonderry is  that, despite us having a small education budget and always crying out for more  investment in the core educational services, the Minister is going on a crusade  of her own.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  As someone who comes from Derry, I would say that the three schools that  Michelle McIlveen mentioned when proposing the motion &mdash; in Shantallow,  Springtown and Brandywell &mdash; would not be considered to be beside one another.  As people in Derry would say, they would not be &ldquo;handy&rdquo;, if you were getting a  child to school. In other words, the Member does not know the area. Otherwise,  she would not have used it to make a comparison.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It seems that the DUP is planning to table a motion  objecting to every new Irish-medium school in the North. Today, on spurious  grounds, they are attacking a proposal for a Gaelscoil in Derry. Last month,  they tried to block an Irish-medium school in Dungannon.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP motion is not about a concern for local schools in  Derry. In fact, no DUP MLAs from the north-west bothered to put their names to  the motion. It is part of the same strategy that saw it blocking the Irish  language Act, complaining about the Irish Language Broadcast Fund and generally  seeking to block the whole equality agenda at every turn.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Were I to make a case for the protection of a local school,  I would seek cross-party support. That is not what the DUP motion is about. It  is an old-fashioned sectarian knockabout, and it should be treated with the  contempt that it deserves.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP&rsquo;s strategies and motions are purely negative and  destructive. That is why I signed the petition of concern, which is an  important protection in the Assembly regulations that enables Members to demand  a cross-community vote on the issue. If the DUP really wants its motion to be  successful, its Members will have to convince at least a few nationalists,  which they have failed to do.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I apologise for not being present for  the whole debate. I have no doubt that I have heard many similar speeches in  the previous four or five debates on the Irish-medium sector, and therefore I  doubt that I have missed any original thinking on any of the issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is about parents who want their children to be  educated in the Irish-medium sector, as was provided for in the Good Friday  Agreement. Therefore, they are perfectly and legally entitled to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have heard DUP and Ulster Unionist Members say that they  have no difficulty with anyone learning or speaking Irish. It appears that  their difficulty is with young children being educated in the Irish-medium sector.  Why is that? No one is being forced to be educated in the Irish-medium sector  and no parents are being forced to send their children to Irish-medium schools.  Why object to a perfectly legitimate education system?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The Member may not have been present during my speech, but I said that we are  open to persuasion on the relative merits of exclusively Irish-medium schools;  we are not objecting to that. However, we believe that the situation should be  fair to all. Our problem is that the school in question will receive  disproportionate amounts of resources compared to schools in the controlled and  integrated sectors. That is why we are debating the issue; it is not simply  about Irish.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Perhaps Mr McCrea should have outlined what resources have been spent on the  school. It is my understanding that the Department of Education has spent no  money on the school and that it has not agreed to fund the school. Therefore,  why have the debate? It appears that it is based on misinformation. My  understanding is that the only money that is being spent on the school is the  money that transfers with the pupils. Therefore, if those pupils were being  taught in the controlled or maintained sector, the same amount of money would  be spent. The only difference is that the children will receive an Irish-medium  education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During a previous debate about the Irish language &mdash; I  forget which one &mdash; I referred to a recent visit to Wales during which a Welsh  Conservative told me that 10 years ago, speaking Welsh at a Welsh Conservative  Party conference was frowned upon, but that it is now encouraged. Given the  political allegiances between Welsh conservatism and unionism in this part of  the world, perhaps unionists should start to examine the broader concept of  native languages.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Welsh-medium sector is thriving. People who had no  involvement with the Welsh language in the past now send their children to  Welsh-medium schools, not as a political or any other statement, but because  they want them to learn the language.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Does the Member agree with the Department&rsquo;s head of development and  infrastructure who said that there are already sufficient Irish-medium primary  school places in Derry within reasonable travelling distance of the Branch and  Springtown area and that there is no evidence that the potential demand for  places is likely to exceed the present level of provision for the foreseeable  future?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  That well may be the case. Is there &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members are missing the point about this debate.  Taxpayers&rsquo; money is not being spent on that school.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Twenty million pounds is being spent.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Where did the Member get that figure? <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  In a legislative Chamber, let us base debates on facts. No taxpayers&rsquo; money is  being spent on that school, so why is this being debated in the Chamber? Why  are Members opposite getting so frustrated? There can be only one reason: the  Irish language. Why are they so frightened of it? There is no other reason,  because taxpayers&rsquo; money is not being spent on that school. The Minister &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The Minister of Education has said that unless &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: It  is strange that no Members from the parties opposite, who say that they are  interested in education, took the position of Minister of Education when they  had the opportunity.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  At times, it is easier to criticise than to implement. The Members opposite had  every opportunity to take the education brief; perhaps they were scared of the  mammoth task that lay before them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Education stated that that school falls  under the same criteria as any other school; if it does not meet the funding  criteria, it will not be funded.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the last intervention, it does not matter  whether departmental officials &mdash; who do not run our Departments, we do &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  know that former Ministers were concerned about officials running their  Departments, but they do not run our Departments; we work together and  Ministers make the final decisions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The departmental official&rsquo;s advice was in relation to  numbers &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Today, we listened to some interesting gobbledegook. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I did not interrupt the Members opposite, so they should show me the same  courtesy. I listened to various Members. John O&rsquo;Dowd came out with the usual  claptrap, which we get from him now and again on this issue. He said that we,  as unionists, are afraid of the Irish language. That is incorrect; I say to Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd and the rest of his colleagues that we are concerned about the wanton  waste in the Department of Education. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  The Minister has set out on a political journey and she has &mdash; as best she  possibly can &mdash; sectarianised the Irish language. Nobody has done more to damage  any hope that those of us on this side of the House would have a greater  respect for the Irish language than the present Minister. Indeed, she has  ensured that such respect will never get off the ground.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister accepts that she will not win the argument.  She has no confidence in her argument so she ensures that the blunt instrument  &mdash; the petition of concern &mdash; is brought into play. That is her only refuge; of  course, she could not get that without the support of the SDLP, which  consistently jumps to her aid to shore her up.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I listened with interest to Mr Bradley, because he  frequently speaks in Irish dialect. I suspect by looking at him &mdash; and I do not  want to belittle him &mdash; that there were few Irish-medium schools in existence  when he was being educated.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, he seems to be quite fluent in that language and  can speak it adequately. My point is that whatever provision was in place then,  it was sufficient to enable Mr Bradley to achieve what he has in the Irish  language.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The point that we are trying to make, and that we have  repeated, is that you may try to ram the language down the throats of unionists  and people like me, and you may feel that this is a great triumph &mdash; because  there is a degree of triumphalism in what the Minister is trying to do &mdash; but  you are not winning hearts and minds. As a matter of fact, you are simply  alienating people for whom you claim to have some respect.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister, of course, does not set out to endear herself  to anybody, never mind to unionists; indeed, I know that she despises the very  ground that we stand on. She does not even set out to endear herself to those  who are involved in the Irish language. The Minister was told that the new  school would cause damage &mdash; whatever that big word means. Perhaps you may be  able to understand that big word. That was not written by a unionist; it was in  a headline in &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another news story stated that Ruane ignored the warning  from the Irish-speaking schools. The Minister does not take anything that  anybody says on board, even those who respect the Irish language. She  disrespects them and says that she will not listen to them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Never one to be outpaced on anything, Mr Brolly said that  not only are three Irish-speaking schools needed in Londonderry, but that seven  could be justified. He then said that we do not even need pupils any more to  have schools. Who will be taught &mdash; Timothy Timber? That is a wonderful concept  &mdash; pupils are not needed in order for Irish to be taught; the only thing that is  needed is money, because the pupils will pop up all over the place. Indeed,  some of the schools are now closing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has a responsibility, although I suspect that  she does not believe that she does. The big acid test for the Minister is that  this proposal will have to be equality tested. Where is all this equality  testing happening? The Minister must convince us that there is a need for this  school. She cannot do that, and we have only to lift the newspapers to see that  it cannot be justified in any way.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  On a point of order, a Cheann Comhairle. Is it appropriate for a Member to wave  a newspaper about as a prop during a debate? I do not think so.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  If a Member refers to the paper or document that is in front of them, it is  appropriate.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  On a point of order, a Cheann Comhairle. It was not clear that the Member was  referring to the newspaper; he was just waving papers about.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I assure the Member that I was watching the Member in question very  carefully to see whether he was quoting from the papers that he had in front of  him. My understanding is that he was.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I was quoting from the papers. There was one word that I could not make out in  the headline, and I asked some Members what it was.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Was it a big word?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Yes, it was a big word.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Was it an Irish word?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  It must have been something like that, but I have no knowledge &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I respect that, Mr Speaker. However, Ms Ruane authorised the funding for the  school in Derry &mdash; I think that is Londonderry &mdash; despite having been given warnings  from advisers and inspectors that it would cause damage &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member should take his seat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. First, I apologise for  being late; I was caught up with something.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is based on the false premise that I have not  considered proposals for new schools in the controlled, maintained and  integrated sectors. The fact is that there have been no proposals for new  schools in the controlled or maintained sectors. Since becoming Education  Minister, I have had to consider only two proposals for transformation to  controlled integrated status and one proposal for a new grant-maintained  integrated school.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Beidh a fhios ag Comhalta&iacute; gurb &eacute; seo an ceathr&uacute;  d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht d&aacute; cine&aacute;l le bliain maidir le hoideachas tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge &mdash;  earn&aacute;il nach bhfuil inti ach 3,000 p&aacute;iste i 23 scoil a fhaigheann deontas agus  in 11 Ghaelaonad.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members should also be aware that this is the fourth debate  in a year relating to Irish-medium education, a sector of 3,000 children in 23  grant-aided schools and 11 Irish-medium units. It is perfectly clear that some  people from the unionist tradition do not want rights for those in the  Irish-medium sector. They ignore the fact that, in a school population that is  declining overall, there are a few bright sparks of growth, and the  Irish-medium sector is one. Against the odds, many committed parents and  advocates for the Irish language have struggled to build an education sector  that is strong, dynamic, vibrant and achieving for our children, and that  nourishes and supports our language.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is, therefore, a logical consequence that proposals to  support a growing sector will come to me for approval: I will support some  proposals, but I may not support others. However, I will always take an  objective view of the hard facts before me.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly &mdash; and, indeed, my colleagues from all sides of  the House &mdash; should already be familiar with the statutory development proposal  process required when a school is being newly established, closed or is  undergoing a significant change that alters its character or size. Proposals  for new schools are initiated by the local education and library board, the  trustees, the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, the Council for  Integrated Education, Comhairle na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, an individual school or  other interested parties. I do not initiate the development proposals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The publication of a development proposal initiates a  two-month period during which interested parties and individuals may send  comments or objections to my Department. As soon as possible after that,  officials assemble all the relevant material so that I can decide on the  proposals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">D&eacute;anaim breithni&uacute; c&uacute;ramach ar gach togra forbartha ar a  thuillteanas, agus d&eacute;antar meas&uacute;n&uacute; ar gach scoil nua i gcoinne crit&eacute;ir  inmharthanachta coiteann at&aacute; oiri&uacute;nach do gach earn&aacute;il. Agus deirim ar&iacute;s &eacute; &mdash;  gach earn&aacute;il.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I consider all development proposals carefully on their  individual merits, and proposals for all new schools are assessed against a  common set of viability criteria that are relevant to all sectors. There is no  facility in those processes to allow for the deferment of a decision on a  proposal, and nor can the Department place a moratorium on educational bodies  and others bringing forward new proposals. In short, my responsibility is to  make decisions on development proposals that are brought forward by others.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since I became Minister of Education, I have taken  decisions on 37 proposals. None of them were for new controlled or maintained  schools. There has been only one such proposal for a new integrated school in  the past year &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.] </span>&mdash; the establishment  of Blackwater Integrated College &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Minister has the Floor. Every Member who wanted to speak in the  debate has had that opportunity. Please allow the Minister to respond.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: There has been only one such proposal for a new integrated  school in the past year &mdash; the establishment of Blackwater Integrated College,  which I approved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have approved proposals for the closure of 10 schools or  units from a variety of educational sectors: one special school; one nursery  unit at a controlled primary school; five controlled primary schools; one  Irish-medium unit at a maintained primary school; and one maintained secondary  school.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Cheadaigh m&eacute; freisin molta&iacute; le na&iacute;-aonaid a bhun&uacute; i  scoileanna rialaithe i mBaile na hInse agus i Magh Ratha, i mBunscoil Imeasctha  na M&iacute;laoise agus i Scoil an Droichid.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have also approved proposals to establish nursery units  at controlled schools in Ballynahinch and Moira, at the Millennium Integrated  Primary School and at Scoil an Droichid.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have turned down two proposals for integrated status for  controlled schools at Knockbreda and Conlig, and we all know why I did that. I  carefully examined the numbers, and I explained to the House the numbers in  primary 1 and primary 2 &mdash; or the lack of them &mdash; and the entire numbers overall  in the school.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In examining proposals to transform to integrated status, I  need to be confident that a school is sustainable, that it will attract viable  intakes from across the community and that transformation is not being pursued  simply to avoid rationalisation. That has been the position on transformation  proposals for many years. As I explained at the time of the decisions on both  those cases, I was not convinced that a transformation would be successful. We  have all seen the reports about Balmoral High School. Members have been jumping  up and down in the House about decisions being taken and money being wasted,  and about how important those matters are, yet here we are having an  unnecessary debate. I am very disappointed with what is happening here. We are  sending out the wrong message. I want to send out a message &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order. Members should not try to speak from a sedentary position. The  Minister has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I want to send out a message. First, everything that you have  said about my not caring about equality or about the children in every one of  our sectors &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Minister has just said &ldquo;everything that  you have said&rdquo;. That is a reference to the Chair. I do not believe that you, Mr  Speaker, have made any speech about the Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. It is clear to both sides of the House that I have not made any speech.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: For the record, I want to say two things about everything that  Members on the opposite Benches have said. First, I care about every child that  the Department &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.].</span> You may laugh, but  I am telling you that that is the truth. I respectfully suggest that many of  Members&rsquo; contributions are made in order to hide the fact that you are unwilling  to embrace change in education. I will not stand &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span>. The Chairperson of the Committee for Education &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order. Every other Member who asked to speak has been allowed to speak.  Allow the Minister to respond to the debate without interruption.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The Chairperson of the Committee for Education said that change  will not happen. Change will happen. I am not prepared to stand idly by and  watch as our children &mdash; because they are all our children &mdash; are failed. The  education system fails 47% of our children &mdash; 12,000. I will not stand by and  watch that happen. Nor will I stand by and watch people criticise a sector, and  treat a sector in the way in which the Irish-medium sector has been treated.  The message that I wish to send to the Irish-medium and integrated sectors is  that they should not listen to many of the comments that have been made. I  understand that many children and parents in those sectors will view today&rsquo;s  debate with bewilderment, but my message to them is that they should keep up  the good work. They are doing tremendous work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not the case to contend that I have refused to  consider proposals for new controlled, maintained and integrated schools.  Indeed, it is to be expected that, in a period of demographic decline,  proposals for new schools will generally come from the integrated and  Irish-medium sectors, which are relatively new and growing. More and more  children are seeking the benefits of an Irish-medium education. The  Irish-medium sector is the fastest growing education sector, and the number of  children receiving an Irish-medium education has increased by more than 10% in  the past three years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An tseachtain seo caite, rinne m&eacute; an oscailt oifigi&uacute;il  d&rsquo;fhoirgneamh nua Bhunscoil an Traonaigh i Lios na Sceiche; is &iacute; an t-aon  Ghael-bhunscoil i gContae Fhear Manach &iacute;, agus t&aacute; m&eacute; cinnte nach mbeidh s&iacute; ar  an cheann deireannach.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Just last week, I performed the official opening of the new  premises of Bunscoil an Traonaigh in Lisnaskea, the only Irish-medium school in  County Fermanagh. The previous week, I officiated at the opening of two  Irish-medium schools, where people set aside their political and religious  differences to celebrate the important role that the Irish language can play in  education. At Gaelscoil &Eacute;anna in Glengormley, I was joined by the newly elected  DUP major. The opening of Gaelscoil Ghleann Darach in Crumlin was attended by  local clergy, including a Presbyterian minister, who presented the school with  the New Testament as Gaeilge &mdash; in Irish. The minister also highlighted the  important contribution that Presbyterians have made throughout the years to:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;advance, preserve and even revive the Irish  language.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I have been to many different schools, including  some in the controlled sector, and have been welcomed with words of Irish.  Those gestures were generous in more ways than one, and could act as an example  to other people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In May, I presented schools with awards in recognition of  their outstanding commitment to spoken Irish, both inside and outside the  classroom. The GLEO awards are organised annually by Foras na Gaeilge, one of  the North/South implementation bodies, to recognise the work that is done in  English-medium schools to support and develop spoken Irish. A total of 21  schools received awards, and four of those are in the North: Holy Cross Boys&rsquo;  Primary School, Ardoyne; Edmund Rice Primary School, Glengormley; St Mary&rsquo;s  Grammar School, Magherafelt; and Abbey Christian Brothers&rsquo; Grammar School, Newry.  It was a joy to share in the enthusiasm of those young people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The increase in the number of parents who want their  children to be educated through the medium of Irish is a sign of the pent-up  demand of recent years that can now be satisfied as the community settles down  to enjoy political stability, celebration of diversity and a new confidence in  people&rsquo;s choice to express their national identity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2008, I introduced a new programme in primary schools to  expose children to a second language. Schools can opt their children into the  programme to receive lessons in Irish or Spanish. A second language is a  valuable skill for children to develop when they are young. When that language  is the child&rsquo;s native tongue, all the better.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards my decision in 2007 to approve a proposal to  establish Gaelscoil na Dar&oacute;ige as a grant&#8209;aided Irish&#8209;medium primary school, I  remind Members that, due to a commitment in the Good Friday Agreement, there is  a statutory duty on the Department of Education to encourage and facilitate  Irish-medium education. Furthermore, the British Government has signed the  European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which came into force in  July 2001. The charter includes a commitment to education in the Irish language  where numbers are considered sufficient. I intend to ensure that both of those  obligations are fulfilled.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: People who are in public office &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member should not persist.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: People who are in public office, at every level, must be aware  of their responsibilities to ensure that there is equality of respect and  treatment for all sectors in society. Language must be tempered to ensure that  it is not offensive to other people, whose legitimate demands should have our  full support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also draw the Assembly&rsquo;s attention to the fact that the  Department of Education considers demands for all forms of education, including  Irish-medium and integrated education, under the general framework that is set  out in the Education and Libraries Order (NI) 1986, which states that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;so far as is compatible with the provision of  efficient instruction and training and the avoidance of unreasonable public  expenditure, pupils shall be educated in accordance with the wishes of their  parents&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the particular case of Gaelscoil na Dar&oacute;ige, I was  impressed by the arguments of parents of children who attend Na&iacute;scoil Mhaol &#314;osa.  Furthermore, I was impressed by, and listened carefully to, what Comhairle Na  Gaelscola&iacute;ochta had to say. I thank Dominic Bradley for his comments on  Comhairle Na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta and the strategic approach that it takes on  Irish-medium education, for which it was established. I always listen carefully  to what that body says. I congratulate it for its work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, I considered all of the advice on the proposal  that was provided by my officials.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Minister must draw her remarks to a close.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I also considered the objections, but, as Minister, I have to  weigh up all the arguments for and against a proposal before making a decision.  I made the decision.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  The debate started with the presentation by Miss McIlveen, who expressed her  disappointment at the fact that the SDLP supported the petition of concern. She  set out the facts and the figures clearly about the situation regarding the  school and Irish-medium education in Londonderry. She pointed out that the  proposal clearly breaches the Department of Education&rsquo;s policy in several ways  and that the Minister seems to totally ignore her Department&rsquo;s policies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Miss McIlveen also indicated the lack of strategic planning  and raised questions about the governance of the Irish-medium sector. She  pointed out the need for a coherent approach, that the Education and Training  Inspectorate did not support the proposal, and that the Western Education and  Library Board had expressed concerns about it. She also explained that the  motion was not an attack on the Irish-medium sector, but on bad governance and  the fact that the Minister acted in an illogical and unreasonable manner.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That was followed by a speech from Francie Brolly, which  can best be described as vague and vacuous because there was nothing much in  it. He said that the criteria may eventually be fulfilled, and that it is hoped  that they will be met. In this case, it is probably more likely that there will  be no hope and Bob Hope. Mr Brolly kept on saying what a good thing the  Irish-medium sector was, but he totally ignored the core issue, which is that  the Minister consistently ignores policies and procedures in her Department. He  also said that he was tired listening to statistics. Statistics are at the  heart of good government, but perhaps Francie Brolly has not yet learned that  fact.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea spoke about the problems with the extended  schools programme and all the other issues in education. He said that the  Minister was ignoring real problems and was acting in a way that was divisive;  that she was sectarianising education, was acting against advice, and was being  partisan. He said that the debate is not about the Irish language, and he noted  that nearby schools in Londonderry had real concerns and that the Minister was  acting against the advice of officials. The Minister said that there were  50,000 empty places, but she seems to be intent on creating more. Mr McCrea also  said that the Irish language was being given shamefully preferential treatment,  and that that is not the way to have a shared future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley reminded us of the value of Comhairle na  Gaelscola&iacute;ochta &mdash; and that is the best pronunciation that I will manage of  that. I was interested in that contribution because I want to comment on that  organisation shortly, particularly on its record in the city of Londonderry.  Trevor Lunn asked whether there was enough demand to spread across three  schools the number of children that there are in two schools. That is the key  question.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mervyn Storey reminded us that the Minister is now known as  the Minister of delay and confusion and the Minister for embarrassing  climbdowns and that she follows a narrow and sectarian approach. Dominic  Bradley objected to the word &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo;, and he was reminded that it is  possible to be culturally sectarian and politically sectarian as well as  religiously sectarian. In this context, the cultural sectarianism of Sinn F&eacute;in  in relation to the Irish language is the real problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Gerry Adams, minus his tie, said that the DUP was opposed  to reform, that we have an irrational hostility to Irish and that there is a  need to work together. He told us that there was a need for equality. That is  the very point &mdash; the Minister does not deliver equality: she delivers  discrimination and preferential treatment in favour of the Irish sector and  against others. The fact that she does not deliver equality is the real  problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Gerry Adams said that the Irish language is not a threat to  anyone, which reminded me of the visit that Conor Murphy made to an  Irish-medium school somewhere in County Down. He handed the children a copy of  the biography of the IRA terrorist Bobby Sands. Is there not a problem with a  sector in which a convicted terrorist is held up as a role model for children?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thought that we should have been making progress, not, as  the Irish-medium sector is doing, setting up such people as role models. That  happened in places other than County Down, including a school in West Belfast  that is named in honour of Bobby Sands, who is now held up to children as a  role model. Is the Irish language a threat? Yes, indeed; if that is the  information that is being provided, it is a threat to the good education of  children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Edwin Poots reminded us that the Minister ignored her  Department&rsquo;s advice and that the Irish-medium sector gets special, preferential  treatment. He said that intakes to Irish-medium schools in Londonderry have  fallen. At that point, Mrs Robinson suggested that the removal of the Minister  due to incompetence and ineptitude might be the best course of action &mdash; a view  that many of us would support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ken Robinson reminded Members that the Minister&rsquo;s use &mdash;  and, I might say, abuse &mdash; of Irish simply reinforces unionists&rsquo; perceptions  that she does more damage to the Irish language every time she speaks than  almost anyone else. He said that, rather than the separate, or separatist,  approach, he was in favour of Irish-medium units in CCMS schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That reminded me of the situation in Londonderry in which  three individuals &mdash; Gear&oacute;id &Oacute; h&Eacute;ara, Donncha Mac Niallais and R&eacute;ama&iacute; Mathers,  all republicans of various vintages &mdash; appeared to be working together to kill  off the Irish-medium unit in a maintained school in order to get their own,  separate Irish-medium school. I note that the republican &mdash; and he was a  republican &mdash; who reported that used the headline:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Derry Provos campaign to control Irish medium  schools&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is interesting that, on the website in which  that article appeared, some members of the SDLP in Londonderry posted comments  that are worthy of consideration, because they may not be fully in line with  what Dominic Bradley said.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Actions such as handing out books about IRA terrorists to  children and the Derry Provos seeking to take control of Irish-medium schools  are a cause for concern. The article about the Derry Provos contains details of  the steps involved in their campaign, and it includes many questions that  people from the republican community were asking. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Sometimes it is helpful to read from such documents.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members also heard from Mary Bradley, who pointed out that  none of the Londonderry DUP MLAs had signed the motion. Of course, one of the  Members for that area is the Speaker, who is unable to sign a motion, and the  other is Gregory Campbell, who is a Minister and therefore does not sign  motions. Consequently, there is no significance to that point. The Members who  signed the motion are the DUP members of the Committee for Education at the  time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">John O&rsquo;Dowd spoke about the thriving nature of the Welsh  language. Possibly, that is because it has not been politicised in the same way  that Sinn F&eacute;in has politicised Irish. In an intervention, Ken Robinson said  that there are already enough places, and John O&rsquo;Dowd replied that that may  well be the case. Therefore, he agreed &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  No, I have little time left, and we are coming to the best bits.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Lord Morrow told us that there has been wanton waste, and,  quoting from &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo; to support his additional points, he said that  the Minister had sectarianised the Irish language.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the Minister&rsquo;s contribution, she told us that this was  the fourth debate on Irish-medium education and the Irish language. Clearly,  she had not listened to what anyone said, because she told us that we do not  want equality &mdash; and there is that point again &mdash; but we do. She is the Minister  of discrimination and of preferential treatment for the Irish-language sector.  She is the one who is guilty of discrimination against others, and, in such  circumstances, she and others would do well to take note of that fact. We are  the people who believe in equality and fairness &mdash; not the sort of  discrimination of which the Minister has been guilty. For that reason, I fully  support the motion &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor. He is making the winding-up speech; allow him  to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">For that reason, I am most happy to support the  motion that my colleague Michelle McIlveen proposed. Francie Brolly began by  commending Michelle&rsquo;s speech. I thought that that was remarkable &mdash; perhaps he  also did not understand what she was saying. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> We have had very good contributions today, and I am confident that we have  demonstrated that the Minister is giving the Irish-medium sector preferential  treatment, and that she is indeed the Minister for discrimination and  inequality. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members that the proposer of the topic will have 15 minutes in which  to speak, and all other Members who wish to speak will have 10 minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Order. I ask Members to leave the Chamber in an orderly  fashion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  wish to speak on behalf of Drumellan Community Association and Zero-8-Teen,  which is based in the Brownlow area of Craigavon. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor. For the second time, I ask Members to leave  the Chamber in an orderly fashion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  The group does an excellent job in the community, and I pay tribute to its  staff for the vital work that they do every day. In January 2008, I received  correspondence from the group when its funding crisis first came to light, and  I have been working with the group ever since to help it to secure yearly  funding to allow it to continue to provide flexible, quality, affordable and  accessible services for parents, especially at a time when the cost of living  seems to be rising almost daily.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are here today because of the inability of the Minister  of Education, who, yet again, has failed to discharge her duties properly and  to provide for those who not only need but deserve support from her Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will take this opportunity to thank the junior Minister  for filling the void this evening to respond to the debate. We appreciate the  fact that he has given up his time to do so. I trust that the junior Minister  will be able to provide reasons why the Minister of Education ran away from the  debate. On behalf of community groups throughout the length and breadth of the  Province, I thank the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety,  Michael McGimpsey, for showing excellent leadership and stepping into the gap  and making funding available to allow after-school groups to continue their  good work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Drumellan Community Association and Zero-8-Teen are not  asking for huge sums of money every year. Sadly, their management spend their  time applying for funding rather than investing their time and efforts in  supporting their staff and buildings. That cannot be allowed to continue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Drumellan Community Association needs approx&shy;imately  &pound;20,000 a year to continue to provide services at its current levels. That  &pound;20,000 pays for 20,000 childcare hours in the TSN designated area of Brownlow.  All sections of the community live in that area, and they attend many different  Churches. In a recent answer to an Assembly question, I found out that the  Minister of Education will imminently be employing an Irish-language official  in her Department. Surely resources could be better spent in areas such as  Brownlow rather than on employing an Irish-language official.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the junior Minister to comment on that matter, and to  comment on whether he and his Department believe that it is appropriate for the  Department of Education to spend taxpayers&rsquo; money employing an Irish-language  official while childcare services across Northern Ireland are in dire straits.  Here is a simple fact for the Minister of Education: responsibility for  early-years services transferred to the Department of Education from the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety on 1 November 2006.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those responsibilities included the policy areas and  practical support for private day care, home childminding and youth services.  It is clear that the responsibility for school-age childcare services lies with  the Department of Education.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A letter dated 8 November 2006 to the chief executives of  the health and social services policy boards from Department of Education  officials about the transfer of funding for early-years development and Sure  Start said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;You will be aware that it has been decided to  transfer Early Years policy responsibility from the Department of Health to the  Department of Education. The rationale of undertaking the transfer is to ensure  that early years policy is more coherent, provides better outcomes for children  and is more cost effective.</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">It had originally been planned that this would take  place in April of next year; however, Minister Eagle has expressed a strong  desire to have this transfer completed sooner and as such the transfer took  place on 1 November 2006.</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">The associated Early Years funding has been agreed  between the two Departments and transferred to the Department of Education with  effect from 1st November 2006. This will mean that the Department of Education  will become the accountable department for Early Years activities and your  funding arrangements have been transferred to it.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue will not go away. The leadership and foresight  shown by the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety will,  fortunately, resolve the short-term difficulties that several groups were  facing. However, it is now time for the Minister of Education to stop hiding  behind issues of language and equality. Practical action is required to get to  grips with the issues and provide outcomes that will more than satisfactorily  meet the needs of parents and children from all parts of our community who need  those facilities daily.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 4 February 2008, junior Minister Kelly told the House  that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;it is for individual Ministers to determine spending  priorities now that the Budget allocations have been finalised.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Vol 27, No 3, p178, col 1].</span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is abundantly clear that the Minister of Education has  not given this issue the priority that it deserves. Drumellan Community  Association&rsquo;s aims are identical to those of Peter Hain, the then Secretary of  State, who launched the children and young people&rsquo;s funding package, the aim of  which was:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to reduce underachievement and improve the life  chances of children and young people by enhancing their educational development  and fostering their health, well-being and social inclusion&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Judging by her actions, we must assume that the Minister of  Education is not interested in improving the life chances and educational  development of children in this Province.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Long-term sustainable and mainstreamed funding should be  made available. In-year monitoring may work, but it is only a short-term  solution. Core funding must be sought in order to allow groups to plan their  activities based on guaranteed year-on-year funding. In the meantime, will the  junior Minister comment on whether his Department or the Department of  Education will use the in-year monitoring rounds to obtain more funding for  critical and valued services such as those provided by Drumellan Community  Association?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">School-age childcare schemes, which are targeted at areas  of social deprivation in order to help parents to get off benefits and back  into work, provide a vital service that adds value to the local service economy  every year. Parents pay for the services provided by the Drumellan Community  Association, but in that TSN area it is not viable &mdash; nor is it fair &mdash; that  parents should pick up the entire bill for childcare, especially when the cost  of living, food and fuel is rising daily. Without funding from the Department  of Education, the Drumellan project and many like it are at serious risk. If  long-term funding is not secured, children may have to be left at home alone  over the summer or their parents may be forced to give up work. Neither of  those options is acceptable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We ought to be working to support families in our  communities and to enhance their quality of life, rather than adopting the  head-in-the-sand approach that has been taken by some of the people who are in  a position to make a difference. We must make decisions that better respond to  the needs of our communities.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. It is unfortunate that Mr Savage has  used a worthwhile debate to indulge in a swipe at the Education Minister and  avoid talking about the actual issue, which is worthy of debate. He has adopted  the premise of not letting the facts get in the way of a good argument.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The transfer of powers between the Departments of Health  and Education took place in 2006, during a period of direct rule. However, the  memorandum of understanding between the Departments does not include the  provision for which Mr Savage seeks funding today, and that is the difficulty.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Education does not have funding  responsibility for school-age childcare. Sinn F&eacute;in is not negating its  responsibility to ensure that funding is found for projects, such as the  Drumellan project to which Mr Savage referred. The Health Minister continued to  fund projects that he was already funding, but for only six months. We, as  politicians, must get together and ensure that funding is secured to make  certain that such services can continue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The debate must extend beyond health and education. Mr  Savage said that some parents might have to give up their jobs to ensure that  their children are looked after. Therefore, let us examine the roles of DEL or  DETI in ensuring that people can access affordable childcare to enable them to  go to work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Drumellan Community Association is long established, and it  is one of the most successful in the Brownlow area. It secured a future for its  estate, while other estates fell prey to the social problems that affected the  Brownlow area at that time. In that sense, it is a success story. It has  several funding streams, including DSD, which has responsibility for funding  the community and voluntary sector, and Craigavon Borough Council, which gives  it a limited amount of money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support Mr Savage&rsquo;s call for funding. However, I regret  the fact that he has used the debate to sideswipe the Education Minister  because he thinks that it is a handy way to grab headlines. A dig at the  Education Minister is bound to get a headline somewhere.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also regret the fact that he brought the Irish language into  the debate, because I too know the Drumellan Community Association and the  wider Drumellan community, and no one there would seek to discriminate against  any sector in order to secure funding. That community is seeking funding by  right, and it deserves it by right.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us not seek other sections of society to discriminate  against in order to secure funding for Drumellan. Let us ensure that, in the  short time that we have, we introduce a funding formula that will secure the  future of Drumellan Community Association and other community groups in  Craigavon, Lurgan, Portadown and elsewhere in the North, because such groups  are a valuable resource for the broader community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the broad thrust of this debate, and I hope that  we can find a solution in the coming months.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to take part in the Adjournment debate this evening,  and I appreciate the fact that my colleague Mr George Savage proposed the  topic. I also welcome the attendance of junior Minister Donaldson.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This debate can raise awareness of the current shortfall in  funding for school-age childcare services, particularly in the Lurgan area.  That is an important issue that has affected many people and will continue to  affect countless people for many years to come. I concur with the Members who  have spoken already, and I welcome the opportunity to raise an issue that is  paramount to many parents and children in Lurgan. As an elected representative,  I feel strongly about the issue. The problem requires a strategic, coherent  long-term solution.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Childminding Association says:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Childminding provides care and learning for children  ages between 0-14 years.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is well known that &mdash; along with rich learning environments  such as the home and the local community &mdash; childminding supports children&rsquo;s effective  learning by providing opportunities for individual attention. That demonstrates  the importance of the provision of childcare services. Childminding advocates  note that such services not only benefit children by improving their life  skills and social skills, but generate economic benefits by supporting parents  in moving into work, education and training.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That would certainly be the case in Lurgan. For many years,  Lurgan has been economically deprived, and it has often been polarised with  regard to economic growth and innovation. An improvement in childcare funding  would improve Lurgan&rsquo;s economy, because it would encourage parents back into  employment and learning.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Childcare, whether it takes the form of childminders, nannies,  out-of-school clubs, day nurseries, playschools, preschools, toddler groups or  cr&egrave;ches, is an essential part of today&rsquo;s society. Childcare services are needed  to ensure that parents have an opportunity to enhance their skills and continue  in a working capacity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Government continue to promote lifelong learning and  endeavour to reduce unemployment rates. Therefore, a high standard of local  childcare facilities is essential. The Employers for Childcare charity has said  that no single Department is accountable for the provision of funding. That  reinforces the need for the Executive to adopt a multifaceted approach to the  matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Employers for Childcare &mdash; which is a reputable organisation  &mdash; also raised a valid point about the lack of childcare information services in  Northern Ireland. It is the only organisation that provides such information,  and it attempts to serve the whole of Northern Ireland. Since the  implementation of the Childcare Act 2006, many local authorities in England  have set up childcare information service points, which are well-manned and  serve their communities well. That system would benefit Northern Ireland, and I  ask the Minister to consider its introduction.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">From experience, I realise that childminders are an  important part of any family unit, particularly for people who are intent on  working. Childminders are often classified as being as important as family and  teachers in a child&rsquo;s life. A child sees their childminder as a mirror; the  childminder&rsquo;s response will determine the self-image that that young person  forms.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Adequate funding is essential to ensure that high-quality  childcare facilities are available in Lurgan and, indeed, throughout Northern  Ireland. I welcome the Department of Health&rsquo;s assistance in securing six months&rsquo;  further funding for 54 school-age projects that were at risk of closure this  month. That has ensured that those projects remain open and that they are  readily available to parents across Northern Ireland. Those projects provide an  important service for local communities at a time when the various costs facing  working families continue to rise. It is of the utmost importance that such  school-age projects continue to operate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I call on the Executive to take an all-encompassing  approach in an all-inclusive advancement that will, in principle, secure a  long-term strategy for school-age childcare funding in Lurgan and across  Northern Ireland. Over the past months, many good childcare-funding schemes in  Lurgan have been left in limbo regarding their existence and feasibility. That  situation must not be allowed to continue. I call on the Minister of Education  and the Minister of Health to take the relevant issues on board and to address  them in the short term.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I, too, congratulate my colleague Mr Savage for raising this important subject  in the Chamber this evening. In the last few days, we have seen the report of  the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister&rsquo;s  inquiry into child poverty. All the people who gave evidence in that process  referred time and time again to the importance of play, not only in the  development of children and young people but in assisting their parents in  climbing out of poverty by providing childcare that allowed them to look for  employment or take further training.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members who have spoken referred to the departmental  responsibilities of the Health and Education Ministers. However, it is the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, within which the junior  Ministers are the designated champions of children, that has a particular  responsibility in ensuring that funding is set aside for children and young  people. It is for that reason that the Administration removed the ring-fencing  of funding for children and young people in their Programme for Government and  Budget and transferred it across different Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The downturn in today&rsquo;s market, and the consequential  devaluation of land and property, means that Ministers who had to rely heavily  on income from those sources now have to look to their departmental budgets to  fund some of their core activities and responsibilities. There is, therefore,  little confidence that children and play will be among the main priorities of  the Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the previous Administration, the SDLP and the Ulster  Unionist Party ring-fenced funding for children and young people, and we still  believe that that was the right way to go. That was one reason why the SDLP did  not support the Programme for Government and the Budget. We knew that childcare  services would not be the only sector that would suffer; this is only the start  of the cry from the community and voluntary sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Savage highlighted the importance of the Drumellan Community  Association and its work in the Zero-8-Teen project. I recall the establishment  of that project in the 1990s for which the association was able to draw on  European funding. The project has been sustained by European funding over the  years, but Members will be aware that there are challenges ahead in respect of  Peace III funding. That stream of funding will no longer be available. The  people who established the group believed that the funding would be main&shy;streamed  by now.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As many Members will know &mdash; and as Mr O&rsquo;Dowd said &mdash; the  area in which Drumellan is situated turned itself around from a region that  suffered from high deprivation and a lot of criminal activity. I am sure that  Mr Donaldson is no stranger to the challenges that face the Brownlow area in  particular.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although Mr Savage singled out the Drumellan Community  Association, the debate is also about the wider Lurgan area. I ask the junior  Minister to look at the population statistics for the Craigavon area, because  Lurgan has more children under the age of 16 than most other council areas  across the North. Therefore there should be a particular onus on Ministers to  skew some of the funding to children and young people in that area. A number of  wards in the Craigavon Borough Council area, including the Court ward and the  Brownlow sector area in Drumgask, remain high on the Noble indicators of  deprivation levels.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and ask those with the relevant  responsibility to champion the cause of children and young people. Too often,  we hear the glib words &ldquo;children are our future&rdquo;, but that is true: children  are our future, and greater emphasis must be put on their needs, and more  support is required for their parents. Such requirements are all too vital in  today&rsquo;s society, where parents face many challenges in bringing up their  children and trying to give them a steer in the right direction.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr  Donaldson)</strong>: I commend the Member for Upper Bann George Savage for securing  the Adjournment debate and highlighting the relevant issues. I am sure that the  groups that he is representing will appreciate that. I also thank Mr O&rsquo;Dowd, my  colleague Mr Moutray and Mrs Kelly for their contributions to the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the work of the Drumellan Community Association &mdash;  as mentioned by Mr Savage at the beginning of the debate and commented on by  other Members subsequently &mdash; for its Zero-8-Teen childcare initiative, which is  a valued project in the Brownlow area. I want to put on record our appreciation  of the work in which the Drumellan Community Association is engaged in  Brownlow, particularly the childcare services that it has provided thus far.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am thankful for the opportunity to respond to today&rsquo;s  Adjournment debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue affects not only the Lurgan area but all areas  across Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Office of the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister has received considerable correspondence in support of similar  after-schools schemes; that demonstrates the important role that such schemes  have and the high regard in which they are held by those whom they benefit  most.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make it clear from the outset that although junior  Minister Kelly and I have particular responsibility for the co-ordination of  policy and the promotion of children and young people&rsquo;s rights and needs, we do  not have responsibility for funding those schemes or policy responsibility for  childcare. Our role is to drive forward the 10-year cross-departmental strategy  for children and young people. We want to ensure that issues concerning  children and young people are central to Government policy making and are not  forgotten. We have been working hard over the past 12 months to ensure that  those issues are given the priority that they deserve in every Department,  including the Departments mentioned by Members.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Undoubtedly, today&rsquo;s debate has shown that we are all  united in the view that there needs to be clarification as to which Department  holds the policy responsibility for childcare and which has responsibility for  funding childcare projects. Junior Minister Kelly and I have been working on  clarifying that issue and will continue to do so as a matter of urgency. We  were involved in the decision of the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety to fund projects for a further six months; that will give us  extra time in which to identify alternative funding streams.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We recognised the need to create a space within which  departmental responsibility can be clarified and resolved. We will then consider  the long-term funding of projects &mdash; and we want long-term solutions and not  quick fixes. A long-term perspective will ensure longevity for the valuable  services &mdash; and communities are in desperate need of those services &mdash; that are  provided by the Drumellan Community Association and by community groups up and  down the country.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the provision of school-age childcare is not a  specific area of responsibility for the Office of the First Minister and the  deputy First Minister, we recognise that it can benefit children, young people  and their families, and that a lack of affordable childcare can be a  significant barrier to employment. After-schools schemes are essential to many  families. I was aware of the concern around funding for school-age childcare  before today&rsquo;s debate and I have been liaising with my ministerial colleagues  on that topic.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to pick up on Mrs Kelly&rsquo;s comments about the high  levels of deprivation in the Brownlow area. We are trying to identify areas  where there is a particular need for after-schools childcare and this afternoon  we had a meeting with Barnardo&rsquo;s on that subject. If any MLAs would like to  write to us and contribute more detailed information to that discussion, we  will consider their representations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Families were mentioned in the debate, and I would like to  draw attention to two things. First, it is important that parents have  information on the availability of childcare in their area and that is the  responsibility of the health and social care trusts. If there is a deficit in  that information being made available to families, we would like to know about  it so that we can rectify the situation. I am sure that the Southern Health and  Social Care Trust is being proactive in ensuring that that information is  available.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, there is a need to encourage parents to access  working tax credit, which can be a valuable resource in helping families to pay  for up to 80% of their childcare costs. Families must be made aware of their  entitlements, and DSD is the lead Department on the issue. If Members have  concerns about the availability of the credit, require any information, or wish  to know about the availability of information, please let us know, and we will  follow that up.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the debate,  and careful note will be taken of what my four colleagues have said about the  Lurgan area &mdash; in particular about the Zero-8-Teen project and Drumellan  community association. That problem is replicated in many other parts of  Northern Ireland, including my own constituency. I have encountered the same  problem among groups that are worried about future provision. I am thinking, in  particular, about the work of the Cloona Oasis Centre in west Belfast, which  borders the Lagan Valley constituency. Some excellent work is being done there  and there are concerns about the longevity of funding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those issues must be addressed, and we have a little time  to do that. We can bring clarity about policy and funding and look at the long  term implications of identifying alternative funding streams to keep those  valuable and valued services going.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Families throughout Northern Ireland who rely on schemes do  not care which Department is responsible for policy or funding: they care about  the continued existence and delivery of the schemes. I hope that the Member for  Upper Bann Mr Savage will take the message back to Drumellan and to the  community workers, parents, families and children who benefit from that very  important scheme that we are trying to bring a satisfactory resolution to the  matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Member &mdash; and the Assembly &mdash; that junior  Minister Kelly and I will continue to work hard on the issue to bring solutions  that deliver continuity of services. I appreciate the opportunity to  participate in the debate, and look forward to working with colleagues to  deliver favourable outcomes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 6.57 pm.</p>
