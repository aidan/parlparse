        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr  McClarty] in the Chair).</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I wish to inform the House that a fault in the Lobby voting-system  software on Tuesday 20 January led to the Aye Tellers&rsquo; votes being recorded  twice during the vote in the debate on the &lsquo;First Report on the Arrangements  for the Devolution of Policing and Justice Matters&rsquo;. The fault did not affect  the outcome of the vote, and the Official Report and the Minute of Proceedings now  both reflect the correct result. I assure Members that the problem has been  identified and procedures have been put in place to ensure that that will not  happen again. The fault did not affect any of the other votes.</p>
        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
        <p class="H4StageHeading">Building Regulations (Amendment) Bill</p>
        <p class="H4StageHeading">Further Consideration Stage</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that under Standing Order 37(2), the Further  Consideration Stage of a Bill is restricted to debating any further amendments  tabled to the Bill. No amendments have been tabled, so there is no opportunity  to discuss the Building Regulations (Amendment) Bill today. Members will, of  course, be able to have a full debate at Final Stage. The Further Consideration  Stage of the Bill is, therefore, concluded. The Bill stands referred to the  Speaker.</p>
        <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="3"></a>Financial Assistance Bill</p>
        <p class="H4StageHeading">Final Stage</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">That the Financial Assistance Bill [NIA 4/08] do now pass.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted that the Financial Assistance Bill has  reached its Final Stage today. When I announced in the House on 15 December  last year that the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  (OFMDFM) intended to introduce a Bill to take new permissive powers to respond  to any circumstances that the Executive agreed warranted rapid and effective  action, I said that we hoped to have the legislation in place before the end of  January.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We are now in the last week of January and, should Members  pass the Bill today, we will have achieved that target.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">During the debate at the Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage, I said that  it was the most important piece of legislation to be brought before the  Assembly since the return of devolved Government. Certain Members took me to  task for making that statement and claimed that the deputy First Minister and I  had plans for how the Bill would be used. However, I make no apologies for  repeating that statement &mdash; the Bill is important, first and foremost because of  what it aims to do, but also because it is a creation of the new  Administration, which means that its provisions are unique to this  jurisdiction. The Bill has already attracted positive interest from other  jurisdictions.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Our experience since the restoration of devolved Government  has shown that the Executive must be in a position to react quickly to unforeseen  events or to target resources that address inadequacies in current arrangements  for tackling poverty and social exclusion. The Bill provides us with the  legislative basis to do that, and it will ensure that the Executive have the  necessary flexibility to address unforeseen circumstances and gaps in the  arrangements for tackling poverty.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As politicians, we cannot always foretell what will happen  tomorrow, next week, next month or next year. Therefore, it is vital that the  First Minister and deputy First Minister, as the heads of the Executive, take  the necessary statutory powers to enable the Executive to respond to future  circumstances or situations as required.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Before I go any further, I want to thank those Members who  made constructive contributions to the debates on the Bill, particularly those  who spoke in support of the Bill and the Executive amendments that were agreed  at the Bill&rsquo;s Consideration Stage. I also thank the few Members who, despite  opposing elements of the Bill, genuinely sought to probe, challenge and amend  the Bill&rsquo;s provisions. That is part and parcel of the legislative process and  is one of the main purposes of a legislative Assembly, it is right that we have  a local Assembly that considers local issues to arrive at local solutions that  are designed to improve local conditions for local people. I also place on  record my appreciation, and that of the deputy First Minister, to the OFMDFM  Committee for the clear interest that it demonstrated in the Bill and for  supporting the accelerated passage.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, there are other Members who deserve no gratitude  for the role that they played. The Executive will not be waylaid by Members who  put party politics above the interests of those in our community with the  greatest need. Neither will we let the purpose of the Bill be distorted by  those who, in the pursuit of petty point scoring, care nothing for facts and  accuracy. There have been lofty pleas about the worth of democratic debate and  the need to take into account the views of small parties. That might have had  some value if those who hid behind the verbiage had accompanied their rhetoric  with a willingness to cease making claims that they, and everyone in the House,  knew were bereft of a sliver of accuracy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Financial Assistance Bill is very short, it  has generated considerable heat in the Chamber. Over the course of the four  Assembly debates on the Bill &mdash; accelerated passage, Second Stage, Consideration  Stage and Further Consideration Stage &mdash; we have spent 14 hours discussing two  clauses in the Bill. Despite the use of the accelerated passage procedure, it  is fair to say that we have discussed and examined those two clauses  thoroughly, if not exhaustively.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the Committee for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister met on three separate occasions in recent  weeks to consider the Bill. First, it met to consider our request for using the  accelerated passage procedure; secondly, it met to seek further information  from us on the Executive&rsquo;s proposed amendments to the ministerial code; and  thirdly, it met to consider the Executive&rsquo;s proposed amendments to the Bill. I  trust that Members will accept that we have tried to keep the OFMDFM Committee  fully briefed ahead of each of the Assembly debates.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Much of the discussion on the Bill has, I am afraid to say,  centred on idle and inaccurate speculation by Members at the other end of the  Chamber about the intentions of those bringing forward the legislation, as opposed  to the real intentions of the Bill. Those Members were prepared to undermine  their credibility by describing the Bill as a &ldquo;Trojan Horse&rdquo;, a &ldquo;politburo  Bill&rdquo;, a &ldquo;personal power grab&rdquo; Bill, and even a &ldquo;thoroughly un-British Bill&rdquo;.  They referred to the Bill as &ldquo;loathsome&rdquo;, &ldquo;obnoxious&rdquo;, &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo;, &ldquo;undemocratic&rdquo;  and even &ldquo;unparliamentary&rdquo;. For good measure, they also &mdash; somewhat bizarrely &mdash;  sought to liken the sponsors of the Bill to a sixteenth-century monarch and a  twentieth-century dictator. The proverbial man from Mars looking in at our  proceedings might well ask what great evil is being foisted upon the community.  He may also wonder about the wicked reason for the Bill&rsquo;s enactment and about  the devilish intention that the Executive are seeking to inflict on the people  of Northern Ireland.  There might be no small amount of incredulity on the part of that proverbial  man from Mars when he discovers that the purpose of the Bill is to give  financial assistance to people who are in dire need as a result of an emergency  or crisis. The confusion might rise even further when he discovers that the  Bill has a secondary purpose, which is to tackle poverty and hardship.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">During the Bill&rsquo;s accelerated passage through the Assembly,  in response to concerns that were raised in Committee and in the earlier stages  of our discussions, we proposed a number of amendments to improve the  effectiveness of the Bill. At Consideration Stage, we amended clauses 1 and 2  to require that any regulations that are made under those clauses be made  within three and six months respectively of a determination made by the First  Minister and deputy First Minister.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We also amended clause 2 in order to increase the degree of  Assembly control on regulations that are made under that clause. Assembly  approval is required, rather than the scheme being subject to a negative  resolution. We also amended clause 3 to enable the relevant Department to put a  time limit on the duration of a scheme in the regulations that establish it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I trust that Members will recognise and appreciate that we  have attempted to listen to genuine views that have substance and that were  offered in order to improve the Bill. Where appropriate, we tabled amendments  that were designed to build in additional safeguards to the way in which the  legislation will operate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>Without wishing to  go over old ground, much mischief was made by some Members on four key issues</strong>:  first, was the involvement of the Executive in the decision-making process  arising from the Bill; secondly, was whether the Bill&rsquo;s introduction had been  delayed; thirdly, was the claim that the First Minister and deputy First  Minister were attempting a power grab; and the fourth related to a number of  amendments that I put together that went to the heart of whether to duplicate  existing legal provisions and whether to insert standard Assembly practice and  procedures on the face of the Bill.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will take those issues in turn. First, with regard to the  involvement of the Executive in the decision-making process, the argument ran  that because we did not have the word &ldquo;Executive&rdquo; on the face of the Bill, it  somehow meant that the Executive were not to have a role in the process.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At a very early stage, it was made clear that we had one  statute book, that the role of the Executive was already secured by statute and  that there was not, in the view of legislative counsel, any need &mdash; nor was it  desirable &mdash; to duplicate legislative enactments. I dealt with that point  conclusively on several occasions during the Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage and  Consideration Stage.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We all recognise now, though not all are prepared to admit,  that the less frequent repetition of that point indicates that everyone is now  aware of the nature of the process, which is that the First Minister and the  deputy First Minister would make designations and determinations, which would  be brought to the Executive for their agreement. In the case of clause 1  matters, a scheme would be brought forward that would also have to be approved  by the Executive. Those matters would be subject to being annulled by negative  resolution by the Assembly, if it so desired.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In the case of clause 2 matters, the determination and  designation would be brought to the Executive for approval. The scheme would be  brought to the Executive for approval and brought to the Assembly for approval  under affirmative resolution. No other Minister or Department would have their  ordinary day-to-day decisions taken in that manner. That is the most democratic  aspect of our Assembly&rsquo;s life.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">On top of that, we have the normal accountability measures  through which the First Minister and the deputy First Minister, or any Minister  who is taking forward a scheme, can be questioned during Question Time. Debates  can be secured by any party that wishes to do so, and any Member can raise an  issue by way of an Adjournment debate. This legislation is subject to the  normal panoply of accountability measures. Departments will inform their  respective Statutory Committees, as is the normal practice, and those  Committees can discuss those matters and bring Ministers to account if they so  wish.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members will know that the Executive have agreed to table  amendments to the ministerial code that will require any proposal by the First  Minister or the deputy First Minister to make a determination, designation or scheme  under the Financial Assistance Bill to be brought to the Executive for  consideration and approval. Once the Bill becomes law, we will bring the  proposed amendment to the ministerial code to the Assembly for formal approval  by cross-community support. I trust that Members will support that amendment to  the code in due course.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will now deal with the second issue, which was whether the  introduction of the Bill was delayed. On 13 occasions during the debate on  accelerated passage, on three further occasions during the Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage,  and at least once or twice thereafter, comments were made to the effect that  the legislation was being brought forward by accelerated passage because the  Executive had not met for 154 days. The House knows my views on that delay, and  the measures that I sought to take in order to have the Executive meet.  Contrary to the suggestion that was made yesterday &mdash; that I was, somehow,  having to defend the deputy First Minister &mdash; I can assure Members that that was  not my purpose. My purpose is to defend the truth, and the truth of the matter  is that no delay was caused by the Executive&rsquo;s not meeting.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The facts are simple. First, the public announcement of an  intention to bring forward measures that would allow payments to be made was  first made by the Minister for Social Development. The proposed amounts of  money were suggested publicly, and there was no hint of any legislative  requirement until 2 October 2008, which, as the leader of the SDLP pointed out,  was some four months after the first public announcement that the scheme was  being pursued.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Several meetings on the matter had taken place between  Ministers, and the Executive were informed by the Minister for Social  Development &mdash; even after the paper of 2 October 2008 &mdash; that, although the  Department for Social Development (DSD) did not have the legislative authority  to take the necessary steps, legislative counsel, the Departmental Solicitor&rsquo;s  Office and DSD officials were trying to find out whether any other Department  had such powers. For example, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (DETI) has responsibilities for energy, and it was possible that cover  could be found under article 60 or article 61 of the Energy (Northern Ireland)  Order 2003. The letter from DSD to legislative counsel in early December 2008  brought that process to an end.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive had already been reactivated and had had two  meetings by that time. A raft of communications from Departments supports those  facts, as do official notes of meetings and agreed minutes of an Executive meeting.  Let us put to rest the suggestion that, somehow, a delay had been caused that  necessitated accelerated passage.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Every Member of the House should recognise the need to make  a provision to allow the payments to be made. Those payments could never have  been made last year. They would have required funds to be put in place, which  became available through the December monitoring round process &mdash; a process that  the Executive accelerated. Normally, the results of the December monitoring  round are not announced until this time of the year, but the December  monitoring round was brought forward so that the funds would be available in  order to give us the flexibility to make the payments. Even then, there will be  administrative requirements to be met, and after the passage of the Bill, the  Social Development Minister will require time to put those in place.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>The third issue that  Members referred to was a &ldquo;power grab&rdquo;. The answer to that is simple</strong>: we do  not need any new legislation if we want to grab more power for OFMDFM. The  enabling legislation for that lies in section 17 of the Northern Ireland Act  1998 and in a later Order, which allows us to vary the functions of  Departments. We needed no further legislation if we wanted to grab power. The  powers that are being sought under clause 2 relate to issues that are already  the responsibility of OFMDFM. Those two facts put to death the suggestion of a  power grab, the prospect of which was raised publicly for purely  party-political purposes.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The fourth issue concerns an area with which I have more  sympathy, and it generated proposals for several amendments. Members sought to  specify, in the Bill, normal processes that would, in practice, have occurred anyway.  I understand that Members &mdash; the male Members in the Assembly, at least &mdash; like  to have a belt and braces approach. However, it is unnecessary to burden legislation  with references to things that happen anyway. That is the case both with  respect to duplication, such as putting the requirement for Executive decisions  on the face of the Bill, and to some of the procedures suggested in the  amendments at Further Consideration Stage. Neither the deputy First Minister  nor I have any desire to dodge Committees or to go behind their backs with  regard to issues that may emerge from the Bill.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>This legislation is  being put in place in order to have a better system of government</strong>: a  Government that are better able to react to unforeseen circumstances. That  indicates a desire by the Executive to be able to face any challenge. It is not  an indication &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  appreciate the First Minister giving away. I feared that he was about to move  away from the point that I wish to raise.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I take entirely the point that he made about Ministers reporting  on schemes to their departmental Committees. However, if I may put to the First  Minister a point that I put to the deputy First Minister yesterday about  amendment No 13, which was defeated &mdash; the idea that the First Minister and the  deputy First Minister should provide a general report annually to the Assembly  on the overall operation of such schemes. Perhaps the First Minister can give  me a better answer than the deputy First Minister did yesterday as to why that  amendment was rejected.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I will give the Member three answers. My first is that it may  well be that for any purpose after its first purpose there will be no further need  for the Bill. Do we put in legislation a requirement for the First Minister and  the deputy First Minister to give annual reports if the Bill is not used during  the course of a year? Do we include in the Bill a requirement to come before  the Assembly when the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister already performs a particular role by scrutinising what the  First Minister and the deputy First Minister do? Should we do that when  existing procedures allow any party to table a motion that would have to be  answered by the deputy First Minister or myself on these matters?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If Members wish to have a review of those issues from time  to time, they do not have to wait for a year. If Members consider a matter to  be serious, they can table a motion, and existing procedures ensure that such a  motion would not be blocked from being debated in the Assembly. The deputy  First Minster and I would be happy to answer that debate. The Member has my  assurance on that matter, as long as he does not do it at an inappropriate  time, and I am sure that the Business Committee can ensure that that does not  happen.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, we have no intention of dodging scrutiny of the  operation of the Bill. I can think of no Bill that will have its implementation  more scrutinised. It will be scrutinised by the Executive and by the Assembly when  the schemes are being set up, and by any Committee whose Department is  responsible for taking a scheme forward. The normal mechanisms exist at any  time for Members to seek clarification or further information through  questions, Adjournment debates or, indeed, by a party tabling a full debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, I do not believe that there is a need, on the  face of a Bill, to duplicate legislation that is already in place, nor to  insert processes and procedures that are already catered for by the normal  practices of the Assembly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I said at the beginning of my speech, I am delighted  that the Bill has reached its Final Stage today. However, getting the Bill to  this point and, subject to the will of the House, onto the statue book, is not  the end of the matter. In many ways, we are at only the beginning of the  beginning for this piece of enabling legislation. It might seem strange for me  to take the opportunity at the Final Stage of a Bill to say that I hope that,  after its initial use, the Bill never has to be used. If it never has to be  used, we will not have had to face an emergency or crisis. If it has never had  to be used, that will mean that all the procedures in Departments have operated  satisfactorily.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The truth is &mdash; and all of us know it &mdash; that it will  probably not be too long before some crisis will come upon us, and it will  probably not be too long before we need to ensure that we have a more joined-up  approach to tackling poverty and hardship. In the real world, we have to face  those eventualities. However, the difference now is that the Executive will  have the ability to respond swiftly and decisively.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I, therefore, commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I welcome the Bill and commend it to Members. There has been much debate on the  matter, and somewhere in the region of 30 amendments have been tabled. Clearly,  everyone has had the opportunity to express their views.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Decisions have been taken, and although I welcome a healthy  debate &mdash; that is what the Chamber is about &mdash; I believe that some of the  amendments were unhelpful. Nonetheless, Members have the right to bring them  forward. I remind Members of the votes that have taken place, which were very  clear, and the will of the Assembly is clear also. Votes of 2:1 and 3:1 on some  of the amendments have stated clearly the opinion of the Assembly and Members.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The focus of the Financial Assistance Bill is to help those  in need due to emergency situations. I believe that the legislation will be  endorsed soon. We will soon have an opportunity to help those in dire need and  to respond to those who need help. As the First Minister said, the legislation  may never be needed, but should an emergency arise, we will be in a position to  respond. I urge Members to support the First Minister, the deputy First  Minister, the Executive and the legislation that is before the Assembly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We will be more accountable to the people who elected us  and to the electorate in general. The Bill is genuine, and we should move  forward with it. I believe that it is good legislation; that it can meet the  needs of the people of this Province; and that it is important to have it in  place. The public can, and will, see the difference in an Assembly that is  accountable to them and whose Members are working together to deliver  legislation that is important to each and every person.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I urge Members to support the legislation and, in the case  of some, to bury the hatchet and move forward.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom mo thaca&iacute;ocht a  thabhairt don Bhille.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I support the Final Stage of the Financial Assistance Bill.  It is an important mechanism, which further empowers the First Minister and  deputy First Minister to provide necessary leadership. The Bill is about  leadership. Effectively, we have 11 Government Departments that are being led  by the First Minister and deputy First Minister. Let them lead &mdash; and challenge  them to lead.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that the Committee for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister actively supported the request for accelerated  passage. During Further Consideration Stage yesterday, my colleague Martina  Anderson detailed our party&rsquo;s objections to all 13 amendments, particularly  amendment No 4 to amendment No 11. I concur with the Member for Foyle when she  stated that the intention of the Bill is to identify the capacity gaps where  this kind of strategic leadership or intervention is required. Why would one  disable the powers of the First Minister and deputy First Minister and their  ability to get on with things and make a real difference to the quality of  people&rsquo;s lives, especially as they are able to do so?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I call on those who oppose the Bill to turn over a new page  and to move forward and engage in constructive opposition. In far too many  debates, it appears to me that the SDLP, the Ulster Unionist Party and the  Alliance Party have been engaged in negative opposition for negative  opposition&rsquo;s sake. It seems to be negativity for negativity&rsquo;s sake, and it  seems to me that they would rather score a political point over Sinn F&eacute;in and  the DUP than contribute constructively here. Every day, one hears: &ldquo;Sinn F&eacute;in  and the DUP&rdquo; &mdash; they would almost blame us for the bad weather.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The bottom line is that there is a requirement for everybody  to engage in working together constructively and to abandon the pursuit of  negativity for negativity&rsquo;s sake. I do not have much more to say, apart from  restating my call for the SDLP, the UUP and the Alliance Party to stop engaging  in negativity for negativity&rsquo;s sake. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  My speech will consist of a few interesting words if I am restricted to saying  only nice things about the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  What about us?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  You are quite right, Mrs Kelly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We have been admonished, vilified, and even blamed for the  weather; we have been exhorted to do better, and to try, somehow, to put the  past behind us. The simple fact is that when one disagrees with something &mdash;  even as a minority of one &mdash; the truth is still the truth.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister said that the Bill has been, and will  be, scrutinised; however, I assure Members that the proof of the pudding will  be in the eating. How often will the Bill be invoked? Will it be used  appropriately? Will it produce better government? Will it produce action in  areas where there is currently no action? Will it tackle the issues of poverty  and social deprivation? The proponents of the Bill claim that it will do all  those things. We look forward to such action, now that Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP  have got their Bill.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister seems to have two different points of  view. On the one hand, he mentioned that Members seemed to criticise the Bill  less frequently and that, therefore, perhaps they understood it better. On the  other hand, I clearly remember him admonishing Members for repeating the same  argument over and over again.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We have not been convinced that all is right with the Bill,  despite the fact that &mdash; as Mr Shannon said &mdash; some of the proposed amendments  were defeated 2:1 and 3:1. We proposed amendments precisely because we were  unconvinced. When Members state that they will bring something to the Executive  &mdash; where the two parties that support the Bill have a clear majority &mdash; or before  the House &mdash; where, patently, those two parties have the votes to put anything  through &mdash; that belies the claim that everything is all right with the Bill.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Yesterday&rsquo;s voting pattern was informative. The three parties that brought  forward a raft of proposed amendments had difficulty in mustering the votes. If  this is such an important issue, why could they muster only around 50% of their  votes?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am not sure what the Member&rsquo;s point is. Given that we all know the political  reality &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Only 23 Members voted.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I have given the Member a chance to intervene.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Given that we all know the political reality &mdash; no  combination of votes from the UUP, the SDLP, the Alliance Party, the PUP, or  anybody else, can defeat the unholy alliance between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in &mdash; we  wanted to find a way forward.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There has been some suggestion that we should bury the  hatchet and move forward. I put it to the First Minister and deputy First  Minister that that will depend upon the style of government that they want to  engage in. Members proposed what they considered to be proper, well-considered  amendments. Whether the other parties disagreed with them is a matter of  opinion, although some claim it is a fact &mdash; that is fair enough. However, if  amendments are brought forward in the proper manner and all points of view are  debated, I fail to see the problem.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister said that he has no doubt that, in the  not too distant future, we will come across another unforeseen crisis that we  will have to deal with. I know of no bigger crisis facing the whole world than  the current economic crisis, and addressing it will require some form of unity.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Yet, what do we get? We get constant bickering and  admonishment from people who cannot do better. That does not build unity. The  two-party voluntary coalition is determined to have its own way, or no way.  Fair enough; it has the votes at present, so it can do that. However, if it  wants consensus, it is going the wrong way about it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party has always supported the creation  of a statutory mechanism to enable the Executive to provide financial support  in exceptional circumstances. It is of paramount importance that any Government  can pinpoint objective need and deliver relief effectively and efficiently to  people who face extreme situations. In that regard, my party supported the  accelerated passage of the Financial Assistance Bill, because we recognised  that it will be used in the immediate future to give relief to pensioners who  are suffering from fuel poverty. That action is to be welcomed. We look forward  to the scheme&rsquo;s introduction by the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister at the earliest opportunity.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party also supported clause 1 of the  Bill for the same reasons. However, the clause was seriously flawed because it  placed too much power in the hands of the First Minister and the deputy First Minister.  If they are serious about collective responsibility, they must promote it.  Clause 1 amounts to a power grab. The First Minister asked how OFMDFM can grab  a power that it has already. In that case, if OFMDFM already has that power,  why was there a need for this protracted wrangle? Furthermore, why did Martina  Anderson suggest that there was a sea change about the way forward?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Where is she?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  That is a good question.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My party made genuine attempts to amend the Bill in order  to make it more in tune with the power-sharing arrangements that are in place,  which should include every party. We sought to ensure that decisions would be  taken by the Executive and that individual Departments would not be overruled  by OFMDFM, because they must have control of their own budgets. Those are  perfectly valid reasons to question whether the Bill achieves what the Assembly  wants.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We opposed clause 2 because it deviates wildly from the  Bill&rsquo;s original objectives. It gives the First Minister and deputy First  Minister cross-cutting powers to dictate policy on poverty, social exclusion  and patterns of deprivation. Of course, people can say that that was in the  Belfast Agreement, the St Andrews Agreement, or whatever. However, the point is  that the Assembly has collective responsibility to work together on those  issues. The problems of social deprivation and poverty will be with us for the  foreseeable future. Departments that have policies to tackle such issues must  carry them out under the Programme for Government.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">OFMDFM has set a dangerous precedent by pushing legislation  through the Assembly by accelerated passage and by refusing even to countenance  amendments that have been tabled by other parties. One of the most disturbing  features of the debate on the Bill &mdash; and Members will know that I am not a  culprit &mdash; was that when Members wanted to express their points of view through  interventions when time was not limited, they were frequently met with, &ldquo;Talk to  the hand&rdquo;, and their points of view were not heard.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That is not about consensus Government, a shared future or  a way forward. That says, &ldquo;We are bigger than you, so shut up and sit down&rdquo;.  Given the challenges that face the country and the entire world, that is not  the way forward. Members who come out with trite words, who say that the  Assembly should do better and that parties must bury the hatchet, are those who  have votes and leadership and must, therefore, set the style. They have an  onerous responsibility because of the challenges that face each and every  person in Northern Ireland.  It is not our responsibility; it is theirs, because they have taken power. They  had better deliver.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will not labour the point that, previously, the Assembly  was warned on other serious issues, such as the proper definition of a victim,  and we ran into huge problems on that issue. The point is that if the accum&shy;ulative  mandate of parties in the Assembly is not taken on board &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. This is not a discussion about victims. I ask the Member to  stay close to the Bill.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Deputy Speaker. I made the point that I was only addressing the  modalities of why it is important that we take account of the views of all  people in the community in these debates.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We have our future to look forward to, and many people have  high hopes for the Assembly and that Members will work together. From what I  have seen and heard, I have grave doubts about whether this generation of  politicians has much to offer the people of Northern Ireland. The proof of the  pudding will be in the eating and, one year from now, I will be interested to  see whether the Bill has made any real difference to the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  At the outset, I thank the Assembly Bill Office for the help that it has given  to the SDLP in relation to the legislation; I am sure that that sentiment is  shared by many other parties. The use of the accelerated-passage procedure led  to the 14 hours of debate, which the First Minister referred to, and many  amendments being tabled. That placed pressures on all parties, but it also  placed pressure on Assembly staff, not least the Bill Office, and it measured  up to the task.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although there has been a lot of hot air and heavy words  spoken, the Chamber, in its own way, has measured up over the course of this  legislation. This legislation has been one of the more defining experiences of  the Assembly. It demonstrated that the balance of power in OFMDFM is very  firmly in Peter Robinson&rsquo;s hands. It also reconfigured the balance of power  between the Floor of the Assembly and OFMDFM.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Due to the content of the debate, the issues engaged, and  the conviction of people from all parties &mdash; and I do not demean people in the  way that the First Minister demeaned people on these Benches I recognise that  there are people in his party who are genuine and who believe what they are  saying &mdash; the balance of power was shifted back to the Floor of the Chamber. The  Chamber began to punch its weight and lay down markers in respect of the  authority of the First Minister and the deputy First Minister and the rest of  the institutions established by the Good Friday Agreement. It began to define a  culture of how politics should work in the North of Ireland, which is not  manifest in many aspects of this piece of legislation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP amendments were intended to probe, improve and  proof the legislation and, without exception, all were rejected. Similarly, the  amendments tabled by other parties, which, in my view, were also probing,  improving and proofing the legislation were also, without exception, rejected.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is not for me to offer advice to the First Minister, but  the experience of the SDLP and many others is that he and his colleagues are at  their best when they are being forensic and technical. Anyone engaging with the  DUP in this type of situation needs to be fit for purpose and as forensic,  technical and political as they are. What surprised me about the nature of the  debate was that over the past number of weeks, and again this morning, the  First Minister felt that he could not live merely with the protections of being  political, technical and forensic, he also had to be insulting, hostile and  aggressive to other Members of the House.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Let us look at some of the language that was used this  morning. Peter Robinson said that there are people in the Chamber who</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;care nothing about facts and accuracy&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">This morning, the First Minister defended the legislation  and said that other Members should:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;cease making claims &hellip; bereft of a sliver of  accuracy.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Furthermore, he accused Members of &ldquo;idle and  inaccurate speculation&rdquo; about his intentions that undermined their own  credibility.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That is some of the milder language that the First Minister  has used this morning and during the passage of the legislation. It surprises  me that someone who has such a grip on the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister &mdash; to the point that he is wiping other people&rsquo;s eyes &mdash;  feels the need to deploy such language, tone and content to Members. It  suggests that the First Minister has felt the pressure, because he knows that  during the course of the debate, he and the deputy First Minister have dropped  the ball in several regards and have said things that have let slip the  chilling truths behind this legislation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Four points need to be reiterated and emphasised. What does  it say about the parties in the Chamber and the nature of democratic debate and  discussion that all other parties&rsquo; amendments to the &ldquo;most important piece of  legislation&rdquo; to come before the Chamber &mdash; a fact that the First Minister felt  it necessary to repeat, without apology, this morning &mdash; can be dismissed  completely?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister&rsquo;s language towards the Alliance Party  was more protective than that used about the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP.  However, even the Alliance Party, which tabled reasonable and appropriate  amendments, cannot say that it has left its fingerprints on the Bill that Mr  Robinson described as the &ldquo;most important piece of legislation&rdquo; to come before  the Assembly. I do not understand how he can draw that conclusion when no  recognition has been given to other parties&rsquo; reasonable amendments. It provides  a chilling insight into how other people in the Chamber view the nature of  democratic debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">What does it say about the political culture of the Assembly  when no amendments are accepted and Sinn F&eacute;in finds it necessary &mdash; as it did  last night &mdash; to boast? The Sinn F&eacute;in Whip told the House to &ldquo;get used to it.&rdquo;  What does it say to the people of Northern Ireland about the culture of the  Assembly, when one party says that other parties should &ldquo;get used to&rdquo; not prevailing,  not having their views acknowledged and not having their amendments to the  &ldquo;most important piece of legislation&rdquo; to come before the Assembly accepted?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Basil McCrea characterised it well when he  said that they told us that they are bigger than us and that we should shut up  and sit down. That is a chilling insight into the mindset of at least one party  and offers a chilling commentary to the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First Minister</strong>:  Before the Member gets too chilled, will he take something else into account?  First, I made it clear at Consideration Stage that I accepted the spirit of  most of the 30 or so amendments, with the exception of one or two. Furthermore,  I accepted the spirit of the amendments that were tabled at Further  Consideration Stage. The question was not whether the points behind the  amendments were valid. The problem is not the content of amendments but the  party political trivia that is being pushed elsewhere. The amendments were  unnecessary because their intentions are already covered by the statute book or  by existing practices and procedures. We do not need to legislate for normal  procedural matters.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his intervention. I note that he was silent  about the very point that I was making about there appearing to be those in the  Chamber whose message to other parties &mdash; and to the community in the North &mdash; is  that we should get used to their power and to their way of doing things.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Replying specifically to the two points that the First  Minister made, you say that now &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I said it during Consideration Stage.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I know that you did, and you say it now, but in your closing speech, when you  had every opportunity to say more in order to try to bridge the divide that  exists in the Chamber over the Bill, you chose to go in a different direction.  I repeated earlier some of the language that the First Minister used in his  opening remarks; indeed, I repeated some of his milder language. Not once did I  hear in his words either any spirit of healing or reconciliation or any spirit  that reflected anything other than a continued aggression and hostility to  those in this part of the House who tabled those amendments. I must say to you,  First Minister, that those words this morning come a bit late. When you had the  opportunity for half an hour &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: You were not listening.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I ask the Member to please refer all his remarks through  the Deputy Speaker, and I ask the First Minister to refrain from having this little  conversation and to include everybody in the debate.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I apologise for not directing my comments through the Deputy Speaker.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In any case, the First Minister may not have been in the  Chamber last night during the concluding part of the debate on the third group  of amendments. I took up the point that Mrs Naomi Long of the Alliance Party  made when I said that I found it curious that the First Minister and deputy First  Minister were rejecting an amendment that would require them to report to the  Assembly once a year on any actions that may arise out of the legislation. I  made the point &mdash; and I make it again &mdash; that in my view that demonstrates that  the First Minister and deputy First Minister view themselves as somehow more  precious than every other senior official in public bodies in this part of the  world, across the island, in Britain, and elsewhere, who, as a matter of  routine and course, appear before a Minister or a Parliament at least once a  year, in one way or another, to give an account of what they have or have not  done.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I say to the First Minister and deputy First Minister &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I will give way in a second.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I say to them that in the spirit that the First Minister  referred to earlier, it seems to me that it would have been useful for two  reasons if the First Minister and deputy First Minister had agreed to amendment  No 13. The first reason is that a practice that is accepted in many other  places would have been established.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I suspect that the First Minister is about to say that  there are many other ways in which the First Minister and deputy First Minister  can be held to account, but when it comes to, for example &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: You are answering a question that I did not ask.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I referred already to this conversation that is going on  between the First Minister and you, Mr Attwood. I ask you to please take part  in the debate, to refer all your remarks through the Chair, and to include  everyone in the House.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  The point is that, curiously, in his reply to yesterday&rsquo;s debate on the third  group of amendments, despite the fact that the debate went on for around an  hour, the deputy First Minister took no opportunity to address any of the  points that were raised, except for one. That seems to me to be the minimum  response that the First Minister and deputy First Minister could have given in  order to narrow the gap that exists between their thinking and that of various  parties &mdash; that gap is clearly a chasm.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will now give way to the First Minister.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for giving way. He seems to be making  bricks without straw.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Can the Member tell us what is the process, from which the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister is exempt, that brings  other Ministers to the Assembly for annual reviews?</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  This is a very specialist piece of legislation. It provides you with enormous  powers and it requires that you undertake very substantial responsibilities in  the event of certain circumstances arising.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: That was not the question.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Pardon?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member should refer to the First Minister in the third  person, rather than as &ldquo;you&rdquo;, as he has been doing. He should also make all his  remarks through the Chair.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Consider an organisation such as the PSNI. Arising from the Patten Report, it  has a whole range of accountability mechanisms for how it conducts its affairs  in the North. I do not have to elaborate on what those are, because they are  well known. Those accountability mechanisms include a process of occasional  formal reporting. That is done at least annually, when the Chief Constable of  the PSNI circulates to every house in the North what is, essentially, his  annual report on how the PSNI conducts its affairs.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If an organisation such as the PSNI &mdash; not to mention many  other public bodies in the North &mdash; has that level of accountability, the Office  of the First Minister and deputy First Minister should have the same. In order  to create certainty and to avoid doubt, in order to build a bridge with other  Members, and in order to demonstrate &mdash; on that matter at least &mdash; that the First  Minister is not guilty as charged by some of the parties in the House, that  would have been a minimum step for the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister to take. In doing so, they could have demonstrated their better  intentions rather than realise the worst fears that have been outlined in the  Chamber. However, even that amendment, like all the others, was rejected.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The debates on the legislation demonstrate that a tension  lingers around politics in the North. The First Minister said that the Bill was  not a grab for power, but he also said that ministerial colleagues from the DUP  and Sinn F&eacute;in were under the &ldquo;control&rdquo; of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister. That tension, that slip of the tongue, that revealing comment &mdash;  however it is described &mdash; remains a central concern about the Bill. Even  reasonable amendments from various other parties were all rejected, in order to  demonstrate where control continues to reside.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As we know, Sinn F&eacute;in said that the legislation represents  a sea change. However, that should be symbolically &mdash; if not materially &mdash;  demonstrated by creating protections and guarantees around the legislation that  gave rise to that claim. Many of the amendments over the past week from the  parties to my left outlined those desired protections and guarantees.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, it is only appropriate that I have the opportunity  to reply to comments that the First Minister made on another matter during this  Final Stage debate; namely, that the Minister for Social Development allegedly  advised the Executive that her fuel-payment proposals were covered by  legislation. That issue forms part of the backdrop to the Bill and part of the  politics that informs it. It is clear that clause 2 contains an attempt to take  the ground of the Minister for Social Development.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Social Development Minister has demonstrated that she  is the champion of good causes for people in hard places, including those  suffering from fuel poverty, social housing problems and the loss of  construction jobs. She is the champion of good cause for people in bad places,  and I believe that the intention behind the legislation is, in part, to put her  in her place, given that she is the one who has been asserting her independence  in the Executive while remaining part of the collective responsibility.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has demonstrated that in asserting that  independence, she has not conceded what is the right approach for her on issues  and as a Minister. That is part of the backdrop to the legislation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">For some time, the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister have been going to some lengths to try to portray the Minister for  Social Development in a way that would not be to her choosing and, in my view,  would not be confirmed by some of the evidence. Earlier, the First Minister  outlined, at some length, how he saw the role of the Minister for Social  Development when it came to the issue of legislative cover for a special fuel  payments provision. It is the story of a letter, a statement and draft  legislation, as evidence to be measured against what the First Minister outlined  this morning and heretofore in the Chamber.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to put some evidence on the record. First is a  letter from Margaret Ritchie to the Executive. In that letter, on 2 October  2008, when the Executive were not meeting, the Minister for Social Development  circulated to her Executive colleagues her proposed fuel-poverty package.  Bearing in mind that it is now the end of January, the Minister was  highlighting the need for legislation for fuel payments as early as the  beginning of October. That letter, which was sent to all Ministers, stated:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Department for Social Development does not have  legislative authority to make such payments, and therefore, Executive approval  will be sought to take forward the necessary legislation in the Assembly  through use of the accelerated passage procedure.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Yet, on Tuesday 20 January 2009, the First Minister  informed the House:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Minister from her party told Executive colleagues  that she already had appropriate power and that legislation was not required.  Therefore, the legislative draftsmen were not alerted because the Minister  argued that there was no need for additional legislation because she had the  power to make fuel-poverty payments.&rdquo; &mdash;<span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; "> [Official Report, Vol 36,  No 7, Part 1 p335, col 1].</span></span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The second piece of evidence is a statement by Margaret  Ritchie to this Chamber on 6 October 2008, the Monday after she sent her letter  to her Executive colleagues. As part of her answer to a question for oral  answer from Naomi Long &mdash; and again stating the need for Executive clearance for  the package and that that might include the need for legislation &mdash; the Minister  for Social Development said:</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;I need clearance for the package, because although the  benefits of the proposals may not reach people until January 2009, the work &mdash;&rdquo;  &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Official Report, Vol 33, No 7, Part 1 p317, col 2].</span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That proves how far-seeing she was. She continued:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;including possible legislation &mdash; needs to start  immediately. Obviously, the package includes direct help for those most  vulnerable to fuel poverty, but it also includes a series of other actions  aimed at bringing more resources to bear on the problem. However, the issue  merits a full response from the Executive as a whole&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 33,  No 7, Part 1 p317, col 2].</span></span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My third piece of evidence is that during the course of all  that, as the First Minister knows, the Minister for Social Development was  attempting to prepare and draft legislation in order to provide her with the legislative  cover that she said &mdash; in those two statements to the House and in her letter to  the First Minister and his Executive Colleagues &mdash; would enable her to go about  her business.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are three pieces &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I have given the Member some latitude on this issue,  because the First Minister referred to it in his presentation. However, now is  the time for the Member to return to the contents of the Bill, as printed on  the Order Paper.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I appreciate that, Mr Deputy Speaker. That is the evidence, as I see it &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  That evidence confirms the situation that was developing in the period up to  Christmas, and beyond. In my view, the consequences of the exchange &mdash; and I  will finish my point here, Mr Deputy Speaker &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. You should be talking about the contents of the Bill, Mr  Attwood. There will be no further reference to what has gone before.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  The point has been made accurately and conclusively.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  It has been made partially.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I could invoke other evidence on the Floor of the House to confirm the point.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, there has been a clash of democratic  culture in the North around this issue. Nobody is denying that there should be  special legislation for fuel payments or that we need to look at legislation  and, if necessary, draft it appropriately to respond to particular situations.  However, the debate on the Financial Assistance Bill demonstrates that there is  a clash of culture. There is a clash of culture between those who are prepared  to have reasoned debate and to incorporate amendments into legislation, and  those who are not; and between those who want to control us and tell us to get  used to them being in charge, and those who want to live up to the standards of  democracy, accountability, oversight, co-operation and partnership that were so  long denied to many of the community in the North of Ireland, and who want to  move forward on a proper basis.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  will take up Mr Attwood&rsquo;s latter comments, and &mdash; you will be pleased to hear,  Mr Deputy Speaker &mdash; not his earlier comments.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It seems that we are discussing the willingness of parties  in this place to implement normal democratic procedures of debate. I want to  place on record the Alliance Party&rsquo;s position on the Bill as it has progressed  through its Stages and as it stands, because representations on my party&rsquo;s  position on the Bill from certain parts of Executive party Back Benches &mdash; DUP and  Sinn F&eacute;in Members &mdash; could be best described in parliamentary language as  terminological inexactitudes.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I also noted with some interest that there seems to be an  almost mathematically perfect correlation between the proportion of a speech  that a Member reads and his or her unwillingness to accept interventions or  willingness to misrepresent other parties. I acknowledge, in his presence, that  Jim Shannon takes interventions. He does not answer them or address the point  that is made, but he is willing to engage in open debate, unlike Members who  stand with their heads down and their speeches pre-typed; who make allegations  about other parties before those parties have even contributed; and who are  unwilling to take interventions in which they will be corrected. That behaviour  will have to be looked at by the Committee on Procedures, or as Stephen Farry  said a couple of days ago, we might as well resort to a position where  researchers email the speeches to the Office of the Official Report. That would  save a lot of time and effort in the House.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The position of the Alliance Party is simple: we accepted  accelerated passage because there was urgency in respect of the matters  provided for in clause 1 of the Bill. It is not a state secret that the  Alliance Party is not an enthusiast of accelerated passage. We have supported  it for parity Bills for social security and for Budget Bills, but, otherwise,  we have taken the view that the need for accelerated passage must be  scrutinised carefully.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">When one considers the Bills that have progressed through  the House with accelerated passage, one will see the evidence as to why a  Committee Stage is required on a range of matters. It is hoped that those  Ministers who continue to promise that they will not use accelerated passage will  deliver on those promises.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My party supported clause 1, because there is the need for  urgent business to be dealt with in exceptional circumstances by the procedures  that are provided for in that clause.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party also sought to make amendments that we  considered would improve the working of clause 1, but they were rejected.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We opposed clause 2 standing part of the Bill, not because  we oppose the principle or because we believe it represents a power grab &mdash; as  other Members pointed out, OFMDFM already has those powers &mdash; but because we  consider the powers to be potentially so wide-ranging that proper scrutiny is  required.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However many hours the two Stages in the House last, they  do not amount to the same level of scrutiny that would be carried out during a  proper Committee Stage. That Stage involves a proper examination of the issues  with witnesses, the taking of written evidence, the opportunity to question,  and the opportunity for negotiation between Departments and the Committee. That  is why something as exciting as the Taxis Act (Northern Ireland) 2008 was,  eventually, a good Act; it was discussed at inordinate length at umpteen  meetings to ensure that the work was done properly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, on some Bills that are more important to the overall  operation of Northern    Ireland, we are not getting any discussion.  Legislation is simply rammed through with a limited debate and without a  meeting of minds, nor any attempt from the other end of the Chamber to achieve  one. That is why I cannot accept this morning&rsquo;s statement from the First  Minister that the two Stages debated in the House represented proper scrutiny;  they simply did not.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Alliance Party supports the First Minister&rsquo;s  general contention that there is a need for joined-up government &mdash; indeed, some  of us have been accused of banging on about it to the exclusion of almost  everything else &mdash; there is no doubt that the imposition of the will of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister through clause 2 is not joined-up  government in the sense that it would be understood elsewhere.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I took some notice of the comments at the beginning of the  First Minister&rsquo;s statement. He thanked Members who had contributed to the  debate, particularly those who had supported his position. As he also thanked  those whose contributions had been &ldquo;constructive&rdquo;, he seemed to be looking at  this corner of the Chamber. I am not sure whether he was seeking to embarrass  me. Yesterday, Mrs Kelly suggested that the Alliance Party was being softened  up for some other reason by kind words from the First Minister and deputy First  Minister. That was a tad naive. Anyone who thinks that the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  price for playing a constructive role is having people be nice to it has much  to learn.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am sorry, but I will not give way to Mr McCrea on this occasion, because he  will probably make the same pointless intervention that he made during Dr  Farry&rsquo;s contribution last week.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: Go  on; give him a chance.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: Oh,  all right then.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  My point is not the one that the Member thought that I was going to make; I am  sure that that issue will come up another time. I simply want the Member to  appreciate how rarely the First Minister utters soft words. Perhaps the Member  is being unduly dismissive. It is not very many people who get kind words.  Perhaps the Member should appreciate them a bit more.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  That is not true.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  will have to wait to see what the future brings; I am sure that I can accept  the assurances of the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment that Mr  McCrea&rsquo;s statement is incorrect. However, I am not sure whether that applies to  private Executive or DUP party meetings.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I may be inclined to accept the compliment contained in the  nice things that the First Minister said this morning and the nice things that  the deputy First Minister has said about the constructive nature of engagement.  I recognise and welcome that, as recently as last week, the First Minister used  the term &ldquo;official opposition&rdquo; in reference to the Alliance Party. However, if  the First Minister and deputy First Minister were to go beyond saying that  amendments are sensible by accepting a few of them, or by engaging in  discussion with those who make constructive suggestions, that would be a much  greater compliment. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, as I hear a Member behind me say, and as Mr Attwood  said earlier, the acceptance of even one amendment would show a willingness to  accept that the Chamber is a place for debates and ideas, and that the  possession of insight and perfect wisdom is not entirely reserved to those who  sit at your end of the Chamber, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Sometimes, the small, or even obscure, points that can be  heard from all parts of the Chamber may contribute to the greater overall good.  If the First Minister and deputy First Minister wish to impress me, my party  and, possibly, Members who sit on either side of me, they should take on board  the simple notion that an occasional engagement, rather than regarding OFMDFM  as the all-seeing, all-wise Department that can solve everything, might  possibly help.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">One lesson that Members have learnt during the various  debates on the Bill relates to interventions. We have, in part, improved the  standard of debate and embraced the concept of taking interventions.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I noted the willingness of the First Minister and  the deputy First Minister to take interventions, sadly, they were not prepared  to take any notice of those interventions. However, at least there is a little  movement forward, and we should accept that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Even today, regarding the merits of amendment No 13, which  was proposed yesterday, the First Minister said that the first reason against  it was that it might mean that they would have to produce a report when they  had not done anything. Given that amendment No 13 simply called for a report:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;on the operation of any schemes made under this  Act.&rdquo;,</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">it is clear that if no schemes were made under the  Act, there would be no report. The Alliance Party was not imposing anything at  all. Nevertheless, that was the first argument made against the point that we  were making.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It seems that while some people &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I gave three reasons; were the other two all right?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Give me time; I was merely pointing out that the first argument that the First  Minister can think of showed that he did not have yesterday&rsquo;s amendments in  front of him and that he was not really with it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The suggestion that an issue such as a formal report being  tabled before the Assembly could be met by an offer to an opposition party to  table a debate during private Member&rsquo;s time, as opposed to a regular standing  proposal for something, does not meet our concerns. Therefore, although a  little listening has been done, there has been no willingness to look at the  matter.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in Members on the Front Benches &mdash;  and, indeed, their more intelligent Back-Benchers &mdash; have learned that open  debate is a good thing, there is an unwillingness to listen; there is merely an  opportunity to take an intervention and to ignore it, and set the steamroller  on its way.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Those issues apply to both those parties, which regard  themselves as taking the lead. They will continue to win the votes because they  have the numbers to do so. They may lose the arguments some of the time but  they will continue to win the votes all of the time, and to use Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n&rsquo;s  eloquent phrase &mdash; we will &ldquo;get used to it&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If Ministers wish to see improvements to legislation, and  if they wish to see things done properly, it would be nice if they would  consider whether matters such as clause 2 really need to be included under  accelerated passage and whether there would be opportunities to improve  legislation by listening to those of us &mdash; indeed, all of us at this end of the  Chamber &mdash; who have sought to be constructive.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. This stage of the debate is very  important. Although there has been a lot of banter about the reasons for the  Bill, it is important that we recognise the need for the legislation and for  accelerated passage. The documentation required has been responded to by the  First Minster and the deputy First Minister in a way that tries to move forward  the passage of the Bill.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members mentioned the compassion that they wanted  to see, but we also need to look at the real reasons for the amendments &mdash; were  they realistic and necessary, or were Members simply trying to put their  fingerprints on the Bill? If the amendments were realistic and required, I am  certain that the First Minister and deputy First Minister, and the legal  advisers, would have recommended that they be accepted. However, the fact that  the amendments were not required meant that they could not be accepted, and the  logical reason for refusing the amendments was ignored by those who proposed  them.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Basil McCrea said that the Assembly has a collective  responsibility, and that all parties must be involved. That works both ways. If  there is a reason why amendments should be accepted, it must also be understood  that they will not necessarily be accepted every time they are proposed.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am grateful to the Member for giving way. Does he understand that it is  difficult for people to agree that his argument is substantiated when it is  frequently the case that proposed amendments are praised, but none is ever  accepted?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  can understand that &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I was going to let the Member finish his point before I intervened, but Mr Ford  jumped in ahead of me. I listened most intently to what the Member said.  However, the First Minister said that he understood the intentions or sense  behind all the amendments &mdash; perhaps bar one &mdash; and that he had some considerable  sympathy with them. Surely it would have been better to have found some  consensus or form of words that the House could unite behind. If that had been  done, and some cognisance had been taken of the good points that had been made,  I can assure the Member that the time that it took for the Bill to pass through  the Assembly would have been considerably reduced.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We want to work together, but we have to know that some  cognisance has been taken of the significant points that we made. As Mr Ford  said, there is no point in being given a pat on the back and being told that a  point is good, but, by the way, it is going to be ignored. We must have some  form of genuine interaction if we are to make progress.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  To respond to Mr Ford&rsquo;s point, amendments may be accepted at times, and people  may give way and discuss the issues, but that does not necessarily mean that an  amendment is right.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  thank the Member very much for giving way. The Member said that some of us  perhaps did not listen properly to the logic that was being used to reject some  of the amendments. Among yesterday&rsquo;s amendments was one to make provision for a  report to be made to the relevant Committee after a scheme was in operation for  a year. The argument that the deputy First Minister used against that amendment  was that he would have more sympathy with the idea of a report being delivered  to the Assembly as a whole, rather than to the Committee. Yet, when a later  amendment made provision for a report to be provided to the Assembly, the  deputy First Minister rejected it, as did those on his Benches. Where is the  logic in that?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  First, I thank Members for the interventions. It is useful to hear them;  everybody has different ideas. When agreement to accelerated passage was being  sought in the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister, two parties did not agree to it &mdash; they did not object to it, but they  did not go along with it and state that it was required. The Bill&rsquo;s passage  began against a backdrop of paranoid thinking from the opposition that the Bill  represented a seizure of power, but let me ask this question: a seizure of  power for what purpose? Where is the power?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly must meet again to discuss all the issues, and  the Executive must agree on them. Mrs Kelly took great exception to my comment  that a majority would decide. However, all the Committees and the Executive are  made up of a proportion of members from different parties, and they will all  vote, and if there is a majority, well, that is the way it is. Unless, we are  saying that within every Committee &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Bring back Stormont.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: A  majority now, Mr O&rsquo;Loan, is different to the situation in Government here some  time ago.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member knows well, and perhaps better than anyone else  in the Chamber, that he must refer all his remarks through the Speaker.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  stand corrected, a LeasCheann Comhairle, my apologies to you. As Mr O&rsquo;Loan  knows, majority rule within Stormont was an entirely different situation to the  situation now whereby the two largest parties have a majority. Over the past  few days, we heard lectures on various situations, and it was Mr Durkan who proposed  some time ago that we return to majority rule.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  made no such proposal. Rather, I rightly accused Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP of  operating the new majority rule, with decisions that are made in Stormont Castle being railroaded through the  Assembly.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. It is time to get back to discussing the Financial  Assistance Bill, so I ask the Member to address his remarks accordingly.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  The point has been made.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The concerns that were expressed by those who proposed the  amendments centred on an alleged seizure of power. The amendments reflected  that and, instead of improving the Bill, were about preventing an alleged  seizure of power. The situation might have been different if the amendments,  rather than being protectionist, had tried to make the Bill better. The  amendments have come across as trying to protect a particular Minister. We  should all have confidence that the Executive will accept arguments made by any  Minister, regardless of party, because they want to do the right thing.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I totally reject the Member&rsquo;s assertion that the amendments were proposed to  deal with a seizure of power &mdash; they were about improving accountability and  scrutiny. To support the Bill, this side of the House must have confidence that  the needs of those who live in poverty, deprivation and exclusion will be met.  However, in the last Budget allocation, the Sinn F&eacute;in Agriculture Minister took  &pound;20 million for slurry tanks from the Social Development Minister&rsquo;s budget for  housing. Given that action and the fact that there are so many people who are  homeless and living in dire conditions across the North, the Member must  understand why we have no confidence that the provisions in the Bill will be  used for the right ends.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  do not accept that argument. The Bill has a new format and will provide  assistance for an extra 36,000 pensioners. That shows that the Executive were  concerned about the less well off, wanted to improve their position and wanted  to expand the allocation of payments. Therefore, one benefit of the delay is  that we have a better Bill.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the reallocation of money in the Executive,  one Minister was not able to spend all her money, which was put back into the  pot and used by another Minister who had an urgent demand. If Mrs Kelly is  saying that the farmers who had to fulfil targets that they were set by all  political parties were not entitled to that money, she is making a different  argument from those made by her party colleagues on the Agriculture Committee.  There are issues that must be dealt with, and it is important that we deliver  for those who are in most need.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The paranoia of those opposed to the Bill has centred on  the protection of the interests of Ministers. It is important, and assurances  have been given &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Member accept that all the amendments related to all Ministers, not  just one?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  The other Ministers did not feel concerned, did not feel intimidated and did  not feel that they were losing power &mdash; they were confident that they could  exert power in the Executive. I do not believe that the Minister for Social  Development felt concerned, intimidated or that she was losing power &mdash; it was a  political argument to get at the Executive. I accept that the former &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  will give way when I finish my point. At the weekend, the former deputy leader  of the SDLP, who is also a former deputy First Minister, advised parties to  engage in more effective debating in the Chamber. The SDLP should take some  guidance from its former deputy leader on that issue, get into the cut and  thrust of debate, and be confident that it can make arguments in the Executive  and have them accepted.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  do not want to get involved in an intra-nationalist squabble. However, the  Member said that all the amendments were designed to protect one Minister. How  was amendment No 13, which I proposed yesterday, designed to protect one  Minister, as opposed to ensuring accountability?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  said that some Members and some parties have particular issues and that the  First Minister and the deputy First Minister have responded to the amendments  and did not see the need for them. That argument was made and was responded to.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The debate has been useful in that sense. However, it does  not mean that because Members think that their amendments are important and  would be very effective, the proposers of the legislation will think the same.  That is the argument that Members have to win or lose. However, it was not, as  it has been interpreted, simply a matter of a block voting against it. We all  wanted to move forward in a clear way to get the legislation in place in order  to deliver on it as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There have been some delays, but we need to have the  legislation in place so that we can deliver on it. We will not have to go  through the entire procedure again, as the legislation will be in place, and if  there are any future crises, the Executive will be able to respond quickly to  the needs of the people at that particular time. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I thank Members for their contributions during today&rsquo;s debate and  in previous debates. I also thank the Committee in particular for supporting  the accelerated passage of the Bill through the Assembly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will now take the opportunity to touch on some points  that were made during the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the Assembly. I will start  with the comments made by the now absent Member for Lagan Valley Mr McCrea, who  said that, at the end of the day, the truth was still the truth, and the proof  of the pudding would be in the eating. Of course, he is absolutely right.  Indeed, that is what the deputy First Minister and I are relying on. When the  truth is seen, and the spurious and bogus intentions that he and others have  attempted to place upon &mdash; and to hang around the neck of &mdash; the deputy First  Minister and me have been proven to be inaccurate, will there be an admission  on the part of the Member for Lagan Valley and others that their fears have  been assuaged and that the Bill has not been used for the purposes and intent  that they indicated?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will now come to the issue that flows from that, which is  amendment No 13 in the Further Consideration Stage of the Bill. The Assembly is  master of its own House, and it can bring not just the First Minister and  deputy First Minister, but any Minister, before it and seek an explanation for  whatever the subject matter may be, including the issue of the working of this  piece of legislation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">For the very reason outlined by the Member for Lagan  Valley, the deputy First Minister and I will be very glad, if the Assembly so  wishes, to have OFMDFM representation in the House to give account for any  issues that flow from the implementation of the legislation. However, I say to  the Member for South Antrim, who is the leader  of the Alliance Party, that he should not forget that at each stage of  implementation, the Assembly has the opportunity to deal with any scheme under  clause 1 or clause 2. If a new scheme under clause 2 is being brought before  the House, it will be completely in order &mdash; subject, of course, to your will  and to that of the Speaker and the other Deputy Speakers &mdash; for a Member to  consider that particular scheme in the wider context of the overall schemes  that have been brought under this legislation. There, again, is a further  opportunity for Members to consider the provisions of the Bill and how they  operate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The other argument being advanced by the still absent  Member for Lagan Valley  was a gripe about the fact that he cannot win votes in the Assembly, just as,  no doubt, he gripes about being unable to win votes in Lagan Valley.  The problem appears to be that he does not seem to like democracy. The Member  for Strangford Mr Shannon pointed out that the votes were 2:1 and, on  occasions, 3:1, but the Member for Lagan Valley wants a system whereby, even if  the vast majority of Members believe that there is no need for a change in the  legislation, the minority should have its way even if it is deemed by the  majority to be unnecessary.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That is just not the way that things work. The leader of  the Alliance Party and some SDLP Members complained that, overall, they tabled  30 amendments that were not accepted. Should the deputy First Minister and I  accept amendments to the legislation that we believe do not merit inclusion?  The argument seems to be that certain amendments should be accepted because the  parties that tabled them considered them to have merit, irrespective of the  advice that we received, which was that we should not accept them, and that we  take those decisions ourselves.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Will the First Minister give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Let me finish the point; I will give way to the Member.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have already said that, overwhelmingly, we had much  sympathy with the spirit of those amendments. However, the fact is that in some  cases, they would have resulted in a duplication of what is already in  legislation, and, therefore, were totally unnecessary; in other cases, they  would have reflected the general and normal standard practice of the Assembly  and its Committees and the way in which we operate, and again, therefore, were  not necessary. The only amendment to which I would have objected on principle  was the amendment to drop clause 2 in its entirety, and I explained why we did  not wish to do that, because it is important that, as soon as we can, we put on  the statute book legislation that will provide the mechanisms to allow us to  take a joined-up approach to tackling poverty and hardship.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am grateful to the First Minister for giving way eventually.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Were he advancing the case that he is currently advancing  on the Consideration Stage of the first Bill to come from OFMDFM, it would be  entirely understandable. However, he seems to have missed the point that I made  to Mr Molloy, which was that when one is told, Bill after Bill, that amendments  are constructive and the spirit is understood, but every single one is  nonetheless rejected on every single Bill that is introduced, one can possibly  understand why paranoia is, perhaps, fed.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: It should not be, because the facts are not as the Member states  them. The facts are that we tabled four amendments to this piece of legislation  in response to concerns that were expressed to us. We listened to all those  concerns, considered those that had merit, framed amendments on the basis of  what we heard, and tabled them. It is not the case that the parties that are in  opposition &mdash; or those that are in the Executive but want to portray themselves  as an opposition &mdash; tabled amendments that were then ignored. In our opinion,  there were four specific amendments that had value and merit, and we,  therefore, changed the Bill in order to incorporate them.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although we agreed in many cases with the general tenor of  some of the proposed amendments to the Bill, we did not take them into account  because they were unnecessary. Many of the effects of those amendments would  have happened anyway, and they would not have changed the outcome or purpose of  the legislation.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for giving way.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the amendments that the First Minister has  mentioned were tabled as a result of representations that were made to the  junior Ministers at meetings of the Committee for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister. That is a clear indication that OFMDFM  responds to Members&rsquo; concerns.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: My honourable friend is right. We were responding not only to  members of Committees, but to Ministers from some of the parties who spoke  during the course of this debate and who made submissions to OFMDFM on the  legislation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I shall deal with another point that was made by the Member  for Lagan Valley Basil McCrea, who is still not present in the Chamber. He  asked why, if OFMDFM already had powers in the areas of concern, it was  introducing this legislation &mdash; why was it necessary, if OFMDFM already had the  relevant powers?</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Again, he seems to have missed the purpose of the legislation.  The legislation is not intended to bring new powers to OFMDFM &mdash; and I assume  that the Member is referring to clause 2 in particular. Rather, it is intended  to put in place a mechanism so that OFMDFM can properly implement the powers  that it has already in relation to poverty and hardship. Therefore, it is not a  power grab or an attempt to claim new powers for OFMDFM. Rather, it is to  provide a way to implement better the responsibilities that OFMDFM has in place  already.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for Lagan   Valley, Basil McCrea &mdash;  who has still not come into the Chamber &mdash; made another factual inaccuracy. He  seemed to think that by putting forward this kind of measure, we were setting  off on some new course or direction contrary to the Programme for Government.  The purpose of the Bill is to assist us to deliver the Programme for  Government, not to provide a course of action contrary to it. I made that point  at an earlier stage in the Bill&rsquo;s progress. Therefore, it is consistent with  the Programme for Government that we want to deliver the commitments that are  in the Programme for Government.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, I pointed out, specifically, that we had the  responsibility, with regard to cross-cutting issues, to deliver on a number of  the targets that were set down in the Programme for Government. However,  because it was cross-cutting, and other Ministers would have to drive them  forward, we did not have the mechanism to get Ministers to do what was required  in a joined-up way under the Programme for Government. The Bill provides us with  a mechanism to ensure that we can deliver the targets that the Assembly  endorsed in the Programme for Government. So, although he did not intend to do  so, the Member strongly made one of the points in favour of passing the  legislation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to points raised by the Member for West Belfast Mr  Attwood. I leave aside his view that there was a shift in the balance between  OFMDFM and the Assembly. The provisions of the Bill reflect the strong  preferences of the deputy First Minister and myself. There were no differences  between us with regard to bringing forward the Bill. The Bill, in its first  use, is to help those most in need. It might be worth pointing out to the  Member for West Belfast that had the purpose  and intention of the communication of 2 October 2008 been carried through by  the Executive, tens of thousands of senior citizens would not have benefited  from fuel-poverty payments. He said that the Minister for Social Development  was the only person in the Executive who is the champion of good causes for  people in bad places. Rather, the Executive were the champions of more people  in bad places than was the intention of the paper put forward by the Social  Development Minister.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The other issue raised by Mr Attwood was that I had somehow  been insulting to those who opposed some of the provisions of the Bill. During  the course of thanking Members, I defined categories: those who supported the  Bill and its amendments; those who were genuinely constructive in opposition to  it; and I gave no thanks to those who deliberately went out of their way to  distort the terms and intentions of the Bill. There is a saying: if the hat  fits, wear it. The Member clearly recognised the category into which he fell,  and felt that the finger was pointing at him. By his own admission, therefore,  he recognises that he belongs in the latter category. Ultimately, people will  judge his contribution on the outcome of the legislation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also spoke of the 30 amendments, and seemed  aghast that Members could bring forward amendments and them not be accepted. I  touched on that issue in relation to comments made by the leader of the  Alliance Party.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is not usual for the Opposition in the House of Commons,  and, I suspect, in other legislative Chambers, to propose amendments. Mr Attwood  said that the purpose of the SDLP proposing its amendments was to probe the  Government. On many occasions, opposition parties do not propose amendments  with the intention of getting them accepted &mdash; because they know that their  amendments do not have the merit to be accepted &mdash; rather, they do it to create  a debate on the issue and to allow a Minister to give undertakings.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If one examines the various debates that have taken place  at each Stage of this Bill, one will see that the deputy First Minister and I have  given a series of assurances and have lain out very clearly how we intend this  legislation to operate. I hope that Members will examine all the responses that  we have provided. If they do so, they will see that we have responded in a  positive way to the points that were raised during the course of the  discussions.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I thank the First Minister for giving way. During the course of  an undoubtedly important series of debates on this issue, words such as &ldquo;power  grab&rdquo; were used. Yesterday, Declan O&rsquo;Loan, although he had toned down his  comments, described this Bill as a dangerous Bill. Today, the Member for West  Belfast Alex Attwood used the word &ldquo;chilling&rdquo; several times in his  contributions. The First Minister and I have been accused of not supporting any  of the amendments that the SDLP, the Ulster Unionist Party or the Alliance  Party proposed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Like me, does the First Minister find it strange that when  it came to voting on those amendments &mdash; which were of such grave importance to  those parties &mdash; the Ulster Unionist Party, the Alliance Party and the SDLP, as  well as, I presume, the PUP, could not muster the support of up to half their  members? I find that quite incredible.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The deputy First Minister made two points, the first being that  this is a pot-and-kettle issue. The Member for West Belfast Alex Attwood  objected to some of the terms that I used during earlier debates on the Bill,  while he completely ignored the types of comments that the Member for North  Antrim Declan O&rsquo;Loan made. Mr O&rsquo;Loan, who must have searched the dictionary for  insulting terms that he could use during the debate, came up with &ldquo;obnoxious&rdquo;,  &ldquo;loathsome&rdquo;, &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo;, and some others, and yet, Mr Attwood made no  reference to those during his strictures.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I agree entirely with the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s second  point. I think that every Member in this Chamber recognises that Mr Attwood has  not quite got himself out of party conference mode and into the real world  again.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We, in the Assembly, must recognise that there are  occasions when we must take off our party-political hats and act in the  interests of the wider community. The public, quite frankly, are not following  some of the nonsense &mdash; the hair-splitting and the intricacies of the  unnecessary amendments &mdash; that has taken place in this Chamber. All that the  public want is for a mechanism to be put in place that can give some help to  those who face real hardship as a result of the economic downturn.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In that context, some Members should have shown a greater  degree of charity in trying to encourage this piece of legislation. As I  indicated earlier, anyone who listens to this debate will find it hard to  understand why the Member for North Antrim used the kinds of terms that he has  done, and how some of the arguments that particularly the SDLP and Ulster  Unionists have put forward could possibly be about a piece of legislation that  is designed to overcome poverty and hardship and to make payments to those who  are faced with emergencies or crises.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although Members feel that they have a role to play in  probing and opposing legislation, they also have a responsibility not to go  over the top.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will be very careful in this matter because I know that  the Deputy Speaker does not want any protracted debate about the issue of  delay. Members of the SDLP have spoken again about the paper of 2 October 2008:  if life had ended on 2 October, they would have a fine argument to present.  Life, however, did not end on 2 October. Further papers were generated after  that time. The Minister for Social Development indicated &mdash; after 2 October &mdash;  that she was looking at other ways of finding the powers that would not require  new legislation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The argument was made twice &mdash; and I have not referred to  this at all as yet &mdash; once by Mrs Kelly, and once by the deputy leader of the  Alliance Party, that the Minster for Social Development had produced  legislation. The Minister for Social Development has at no time produced  legislation in order to take this Bill forward. I have the letter with me. The  first letter, which &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. First Minister, you were quite right to say that I do not  want you to go down that route. I gave you latitude in your original  contribution to the debate, and I gave Mr Attwood leeway in responding to that;  however, I do not think that we need go any further. Please stick to the matter  of the Financial Assistance Bill.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I accept your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. However, there are  Members present who have criticised other Members for not listening to them,  and for not replying to points that they had made. I simply wanted to reply to  a point that I had listened to and could have provided information on, which  might have put the Member in a better position to deal with the issue.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Will the First Minister agree that when one is presenting written evidence to  support a case, one should give all that written evidence and, indeed, all the  oral evidence?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Yes, of course one should. However, the Member who first raised  the point did so on the basis of a selective leak from an irresponsible person  and was clearly not given all the evidence to bring forward. I accept the  Deputy Speaker&rsquo;s ruling, and will not &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Will the First Minister give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I will, providing it is not about that particular issue. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Unfortunately, I cannot promise that I will not stray &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I can promise you that you will not speak on that  particular issue. If it is not about that particular issue, you can intervene;  if it is, we will go back to the First Minister.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: As Members are aware, the catalyst for this Bill comes from the  need to have a legislative basis for making a one-off payment of &pound;150 to help  those households suffering from fuel poverty. That plan was announced by the  Minister of Finance and Personnel as part of the Executive&rsquo;s response to the  economic downturn.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I accept entirely the point made by the deputy leader of  the Alliance Party that this is the first use of the Bill. It is an enabling  Bill and does not, in itself, make that provision, but it was felt to be right  &mdash; and I think that the Alliance Party agreed with the decision that the  Executive took &mdash; that rather than coming forward each time with a piece of  legislation to deal with a particular Department&rsquo;s emergency, there should be  one piece of legislation that can be used in all cases. I think that that was  the right decision to take, but, again, I hope that it will not be used too  often.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill provides us with the basis on which to do that,  and it is, therefore, important that the Bill is passed by the House and  receives Royal Assent as soon as possible.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Subject to the Bill&rsquo;s becoming law, and to Executive  agreement, the deputy First Minister and I will immediately make a  determination on designation so as to enable a scheme to be developed for  making the fuel payments. Officials are considering the available options, and  their advice will help to guide Ministers in agreeing the most effective means  of getting payments to those households that need it most. The deputy First  Minister and I are agreed on the fact that we want those payments to be made as  quickly as possible, as they address an immediate need. The Executive will be  fully involved in that process. The relevant Committee will undertake its  normal scrutiny of the resulting regulations that outline the fuel-payment  scheme. The Assembly will have ultimate control of the continued operation of  the eventual scheme.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We look forward to working with Members on the first  outworking of the powers in this enabling piece of legislation. I urge the  Assembly to support the measure.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>

        <p class="H4StageHeading">Draft Energy (Amendment) Order &nbsp;(Northern Ireland) 2009</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">That the draft Energy (Amendment) Order (Northern Ireland)  2009 be approved.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">This statutory rule has been made under powers that are  contained in the Energy (Northern    Ireland) Order 2003, which prescribes that  the Order must be laid in draft for approval by affirmative resolution of the  Assembly. It amends existing provisions in the Energy Order 2003 that relate to  the operation of the Northern Ireland renewables obligation (NIRO), which is  the main support mechanism to encourage the development of renewables in  Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The debate could not be timelier as we look east to the  recent problems with the flow of gas from Russia and consider the  unpredictability of oil price fluctuations during the past year. It is vital  that we, in Northern Ireland,  do all that we can to increase the levels of our indigenous renewable energy.  That is important to secure the energy supply; to cushion the volatility and  impact of longer-term energy prices; and to tackle the challenges of climate  change.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Before I outline the amendment&rsquo;s key focus, I will explain  briefly the background of the Northern    Ireland renewables obligation. NIRO is the  main support mechanism for our renewables policy. I am pleased to note that it  has successfully stimulated large-scale renewables investment in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, the amount of electricity that is being generated  from renewable sources is double what it was when NIRO was introduced in 2005.  Almost 7% of electricity now comes from indigenous renewable sources, primarily  onshore wind, which continues to be the most commercially viable renewable  technology. I am confident that the current renewable electricity target of 12%  by 2012 will be met.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">NIRO provides the financial incentive that is needed by  eligible generators and renewables developers through a system of certificates  known as NIROCs (Northern Ireland  renewables obligation certificates), which are awarded for each megawatt hour  of output that is consumed in Northern    Ireland. Those certificates are, in turn,  needed by electricity suppliers to demonstrate that the proportion of their  sales that is specified in NIRO legislation for any particular year can be  accounted for by renewables generation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Otherwise, suppliers must pay a buyout fee in order to meet  their obligation under NIRO. The buyout alternative means, therefore, that  renewables obligation certificates have a tradable value, which is typically in  the region of &pound;40 to &pound;50 and which provides the additional revenue stream that  is needed by generators of green electricity.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">NIRO operates in tandem with similar obligations in Great Britain.  There is a single UK-wide market for renewables obligation certificates,  regardless of the obligation under which they are issued.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The primary purpose of the statutory rule is to amend  existing primary legislation to allow for the principle of banding in NIRO &mdash;  that is, to allow different renewable energy technologies to receive differing  degrees of support in order to take into account their relative costs. That  means that less well developed and more expensive technologies will receive  higher levels of support through getting more than one renewable obligation certificate  for each unit of output, while others will receive lower levels of support by  getting only a fraction of a renewable obligation certificate for each unit of  output.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Those banding proposals received broad support in the  public consultation exercise that was undertaken by the Department during  summer 2008. By increasing support for some technologies, the revised NIRO will  help to advance the development of other sources of renewable electricity, such  as offshore wind, wave, tidal, and some forms of bioenergy, while continuing to  provide a useful incentive for Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s valuable onshore wind resource.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Order does not set out the level of banding that each  technology or energy source will receive. Recently, that detail has been the  subject of further public consultation. Based on the outcome of that  consultation, I will bring forward shortly the second stage of legislative  changes that are needed to introduce the detailed banding proposals. That will  be the new Northern Ireland  renewables obligation Order, which the Department plans to implement by 1 April  2009.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">For the sake of clarity, I reiterate that today&rsquo;s draft  Order provides simply for the principle of banding to be introduced, not the  detail. However, it does provide for associated and consequential changes that  are needed to introduce the principle of banding. Specifically, the draft Order  provides for the principle of grandfathering to be introduced, which will allow  existing projects, or those near to coming on stream, to keep the levels of  support on which they relied in making investment decisions. That is especially  critical for technologies that will receive a lower level of support under the  new banded arrangements and had made their investments on the basis of  receiving one ROC for each unit of output.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Order also provides for the continued operation  of the NIRO in tandem with the Great    Britain obligation. That is particularly  valuable for us, as it not only provides the market size needed to make the  NIRO viable, but because it allows us, though being able to operate on a  relatively low obligation level, to reduce the impact on consumer costs.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Order introduces a provision for the NIRO  administration costs incurred by the Northern Ireland Utility Regulator and the  GB regulator, Ofgem, which administers NIRO on behalf of the regulator, to be  met from the buyout fund. All those changes reflect the recent amendments that  the Energy Act 2008 made to the equivalent primary legislation in Great Britain.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Before finishing, I will comment on the need to make late  minor drafting amendments to the draft Order as originally laid in November.  Those require laying a revised draft Order at short notice, which, although  unusual, is necessary in this case because of the time frames to which we are  working with the Department of Energy and Climate Change in London in order to have the banded  obligations in place by April.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The drafting amendments did not involve any change to the  policy intent of the draft Order. They were needed because Department of Energy  and Climate Change lawyers were of the view that the interaction between our  draft Order and the equivalent GB legislation would preclude the GB legislation  from issuing ROCs in respect of generation in Northern Ireland territorial  waters. That is a feature of the current obligations, and one that we propose  to continue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We may wish to secure that power for Northern Ireland  in due course, and I will consider that in the context of the outcome of the  strategic environmental assessment of our offshore renewable energy. In the  short term, however, the main imperative is to ensure that all eligible  projects that are located in Northern    Ireland territorial waters can benefit from  the increased level of ROCs for offshore generation. The late amendment to the  draft Order secures that position.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I know that many Members will agree with me that increasing  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s renewable electricity generation is critical, not just to  meet targets but to reduce our overly high dependence on imported fossil fuels,  to help to make our energy supply more secure, and to help to shield us from  the price volatility of world energy markets. I hope that Members will support  the amendment to the primary legislation to allow variations in the levels of  support that different renewable technologies will get. I look forward to  putting the detailed banding proposals before the Assembly in March.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Paul Butler.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Is the Chairperson or the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee not called first?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Paul Butler.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  statement on the draft Order. There were particular concerns about the expense  of investing in the marine power section of the banding system. What are the  incentives for people to invest in wave and tidal projects in order to meet  that part of the NIRO?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Jim Wells.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: We  are all somewhat taken aback by the fact that Mr Mark Durkan, Chairperson of  the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, is not present, and I understand that he had a statement  prepared. Perhaps I should give way to the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee,  because I believe that they take priority in such circumstances.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (Ms J McCann)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. About half an hour ago, I was asked to deputise for Mr Durkan. The  Office of the Speaker should have been informed that I, as Deputy Chairperson,  am standing in for Mark because he is unable to attend.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: We were not told. Your name is not on the list, and I must call  Members whose names are on the list. I can now call Jennifer McCann.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  That is two Shinners in a row.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I called Mr Wells, but was then asked to withdraw that decision on  the basis that the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee should be called first.  She has a statement to make on the Committee&rsquo;s behalf. That is what I am doing,  and that is why I am doing it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The  Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment has considered proposals to amend and replace the primary  provisions of the Energy Order (NI) 2003 in relation to the NI renewables  obligation. The Committee was made aware that local legislation is dependent on  primary legislation being enacted in GB. Therefore, we must make those changes  together in order to avoid distorting the market.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The NIRO works in tandem with the renewables obligation in England and Wales  and the renewables obligation in Scotland. There is effectively a  single market for renewable obligation certificates. That has led to concern  within the Committee that the Scottish Executive propose to award more ROCs for  tidal-stream and wave generation than the Department does here. That could mean  that wave and tidal device operators here would receive only two ROCs per  megawatt hour for the electricity that they generate, while their Scottish  counterparts, under current proposals, would receive three and five ROCs per  megawatt hour for tidal-stream and wave generation respectively. That  discrepancy has the potential to lead to underinvestment in marine renewables  here compared with Scotland.  The Committee will explore that matter further when it considers the SL1 for  the proposed 2009 NIRO.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is also concerned that the renewable obligation  certificates here and the renewable electricity feed-in tariffs regime in the  South are not compatible. It is somewhat tenuous to claim that a single  electricity market exists when the two schemes to provide incentives for  generating renewable electricity result in operators on one side of the border  being unable to avail themselves of incentives to provide electricity to  suppliers on the other side of the border. The Committee will watch that issue  closely.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">After consideration of the proposals at SL1 stage on 3 July  2008, the Committee subsequently considered the Energy (Amendment) Order (NI)  2009 on 20 November and 16 December 2008. Despite the issues that I have  raised, the Committee recommends that the Assembly affirm the Order.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Members might wonder why I was so taken aback when I was called previously; I  was relying on our Chairman, Mr Mark Durkan, to speak, and I had set aside 40  minutes for his contribution. Our Chairman is extremely diligent, and I am  certain that had he been in the Chamber, he would have read up and given an  excellent presentation on the important Order.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I support the Minister&rsquo;s Order, which will benefit Northern Ireland.  As I have told the Committee previously, I often think that people in Northern Ireland  are like the man who buys a new Range Rover in order to take bottles to the  recycling plant. We are prepared to take the easy options on renewables and the  protection of the environment. However, we baulk at the difficult decisions.  Sadly, there was a good example in the UK  recently in relation to the third runway at Heathrow Airport.  Our own Government have set a challenging target of an 80% reduction in carbon  emissions by 2050. Having put the rubber stamp on that decision, the Government  then baulked at the first major policy decision that affected them and decided  to go ahead with the third runway. It is clear that we will have to take some  difficult actions in the next few years if we are to meet that target.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Remember, the target of 80% reduction by 2050 is based on  the consumption rates of energy in 1990. Therefore, in order to reach that  target by 2050, we must, in effect, reduce our current energy use by 90%. That  will only be possible if there is a massive increase in the use of renewables,  not only in Northern Ireland,  but throughout western Europe. Therefore, any amendment to the legislation that  will facilitate that must be very welcome. The whole House should support the  motion.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I do not see the issue as being entirely negative. Renewables  offer a massive opportunity for the economy of Northern Ireland, because we have  plenty of sea, plenty of tide and plenty of wind. We are, therefore, in a  privileged position in comparison with other countries, as we have the basic  forces of nature, which can be harnessed to create renewable energy. We have  wind farms, and the tidal turbine at the Narrows  on Strangford Lough. Although my colleague Mr Hamilton maintains that that is  in Strangford, I maintain that it is actually in South Down. I am absolutely  certain of that. A pioneering effort in renewables is being made at Strangford  Lough, and the tests of the turbine have proven to be exceptionally successful  in generating a large amount of totally renewable power.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are many other sources of renewables that we in the  Province can utilise, but there must also be an opportunity for our beleaguered  industry to manufacture many of the items that are required to harness that  energy supply &mdash; turbines in particular. I believe that we are pushing an open  door.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am also delighted that, yesterday, the President of the United States,  Mr Obama, very clearly nailed his colours to the renewables mast as well.  Almost every Government Minister in every part of the world has signed up to  the need for an increase in renewables. I have no doubt that President Obama is  following our own Minister&rsquo;s lead in that respect.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have no problems whatsoever in wishing the Order a fair  wind, and I urge the entire House to vote for it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and Mr Wells&rsquo;s comments. The use of finite  resources was mentioned in President Obama&rsquo;s inaugural speech last Tuesday as  well, so it is an issue that is important far beyond here.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister made the point, which was supported by Mr  Wells, that it is not just a matter of meeting our targets in relation to  renewable energy. We can do more than that; we should be aiming to exceed those  targets. I referred to the issue in a question to the Minister of the  Environment at Question Time yesterday, and &mdash; as children sometimes say about a  reaction from parents or teachers &mdash; I got the head ate off me. I received a  lecture about how it was enough simply to meet our targets here in Northern Ireland.  I am glad to hear another voice in the DUP speaking more passionately about the  issue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I would like some clarification from the Minister in  relation to the ROCs and the single energy market. I take the point that she  made about the UK  implications. However, when the producers of renewable energy have surplus  electricity, the certificates are not tradable on the island of Ireland.  Therefore, some of that surplus electricity cannot be put into a single energy  market for the island. That is a problem here in the North of Ireland and,  equally, in the South of Ireland, because the system does not work the other  way around either. I raise the issue in case it has implications for  amendments. We should keep those options open, and work towards creating a  situation in which producers of renewable energy anywhere on the island can  feed their surpluses into the supply, North or South of the border, regardless  of where they are located.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That will improve the system and provide greater security  for the generation of electricity across the island.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  The draft Energy (Amendment) Order (Northern   Ireland) 2009 has been considered by the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment, and we are in support of it. Like other speakers, I remind the  Minister and the Department of the very powerful speech that was made by  President Obama last week. It is important that a man of his stature provides a  lead on such an important issue as the development of renewables.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Enterprise,  Trade and Investment Committee clearly needs to address the issue because all  of us now realise the difficulties that have been created by the global  recession and the instability of energy prices throughout the world. I urge the  Minister to speak to her counterpart in the Republic  of Ireland to encourage the greater  development of renewable sources throughout the island of Ireland.  The single electricity market provides an opportunity to create such  co-operation. The island   of Ireland has a huge  amount of natural resources to develop renewable energy through wind and tidal  power. The Ards Peninsula experiment is leading the way  in the development of tidal power.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">During lunchtime, we received a very powerful statement  from Douglas McIldoon, the former regulator. From what he told us, it is clear  that consumers in Northern    Ireland are paying too much for their  electricity. Hopefully, we will address that issue in future. In conclusion, as  a member of the Committee, I fully support the draft Order.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I thank the Members who took part in the debate for their  thoughtful contributions. I am pleased that the legislation is supported, and I  thank the Deputy Chairperson of the ETI Committee for outlining the concerns  and, ultimately, the support of the Committee for this legislation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will deal with a couple of issues that were raised during  the debate. The Committee will know that Faber Maunsell was appointed by the  Department to undertake a strategic environmental assessment of offshore wind  and marine renewables in Northern    Ireland waters. Mr Butler made that point at  the start of the debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">On completion of that strategic environmental assessment in  spring 2010, we will work with the Crown Estate &mdash; the owners of the seabed&mdash; to  develop the programme, which will involve a competitive application process for  commercial renewable energy projects in 2010. Several national and  international companies have already expressed an interest in generating  electricity in Northern    Ireland waters, which we very much welcome.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mention was also made of the Scottish proposals for a  higher level of support for wave and tidal technologies. I stress to Members  that those are only proposals at the moment &mdash; they have not been endorsed by Europe. I will evaluate whether that is the most  appropriate means of encouraging such investment for Northern Ireland. In discussions  with my officials and in responses to statutory consultations on the band of  NIRO, developers have indicated that ROC rates are not the only factor in their  investment decisions for offshore renewable projects.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Other areas, such as access to the grid and the ability of  projects to have their electricity taken when they are ready in the next few  years, are considered critical as well. Therefore, although I understand the  points that have been made, more work must be done on those matters.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The single electricity market is another subject that often  comes up, and it was mentioned by Mr Gallagher, Mr Neeson and the Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment. There has been much discussion because the Republic of  Ireland&rsquo;s system is different to the one in the UK &mdash; the Republic uses a  feed-in tariff, whereas, the UK deals in ROCs. That is a fundamental  difficulty. If we intend to change the system that we use, we must ensure that  we do not penalise people who have based investment decisions in Northern Ireland  on the renewable obligation certificate system.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, we must be mindful that chopping and changing  systems might point Northern    Ireland out as a risky place in which to  invest. We must project stability and say that this is our system, and we are  sticking to it. That does not mean that we are not examining the Republic&rsquo;s  feed-in tariff and attempting to work with our colleagues there on the matter.  We are doing so, and we will continue to do so.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Jim Wells indicated his support for the  motion, and he said that there is plenty of wind in Northern Ireland. He is right,  although most of it is in the west &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: It  is mostly in the Chamber.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: That is also right. Nevertheless, we must look beyond  onshore-wind power generation, and consider other technologies, such as marine,  wave and offshore wind. In addition, Mr Wells spoke about the third runway at  Heathrow; however, that subject is completely ultra vires with regard to the Department  of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, so I will make no comment about it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wells maintained that the SeaGen project on Strangford  Lough is actually in his constituency of South Down, but I think that the clue  is in the name of the lough. The success of SeaGen should not be  underestimated; it is a hugely successful pilot project, and it lends itself to  Northern Ireland  leading the way in marine technology. Although the Scottish Executive have made  a lot of noise about leading the way in marine technology, Northern Ireland is  the first place to have the type of technology that is being piloted in  Strangford Lough. We should be &mdash; and I am &mdash; particularly proud of that fact,  and I was able to point that out last week in Brussels, where I attended an energy  conference.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We should also take advantage of the green economy. Much  has been said about Mr Obama, the President of the United States &mdash; where this Chamber  leads, he follows. The potential exists for this Administration to bring many  green jobs to Northern    Ireland, and the SeaGen project clearly  demonstrates that point. Therefore, I welcome the scope for investment in that  area, which the Matrix report identified as a key sector, and my Department  will be working closely with colleagues in Invest NI to identify those  possibilities in the green sector.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I say to Mr Gallagher the Member for Fermanagh and South  Tyrone that climate change is not the only driver in the Bill; there are three  drivers: climate change; the need for a competitive energy market; and the need  for a secure energy market. We must consider all three elements.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although amending the support system to encourage the  development of new and innovative technologies is not the only thing that we  must do to ensure that Northern    Ireland benefits from increased levels of  renewable electricity, it is a vital measure, and the banding proposal will  ensure that our renewables policy remains robust and effective. Therefore, I  commend the motion to the House.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">That the draft Energy (Amendment) Order (Northern Ireland)  2009 be approved.</p>
        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="5"></a>Committee Business</p>
        <p class="H4StageHeading">Strategic Stocktake</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to two hours for the  debate. The proposer of the motion will have 15 minutes in which to propose and  15 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who are  called to speak will have five minutes.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: I beg  to move</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly takes note of the Executive&rsquo;s budget  position for 2009/10 and 2010/11, in the context of the strategic stocktake as  conveyed by the Minister of Finance and Personnel in the statement on 20  January 2009.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will begin by making remarks on behalf of the Committee,  and if time permits, I will make some personal remarks. I will make that  divergence clear, if it is not already so.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The debate follows on from last week&rsquo;s statement from the  Minister of Finance and Personnel on the strategic stocktake of the Executive&rsquo;s  Budget for 2009-2010 and 2010-11. I welcome the opportunity to debate the way  ahead, especially in the context of the current financial and economic climate  and the challenge that that presents for the Executive and the Assembly with  regard to their delivery of the priorities in the Programme for Government  (PFG) and to achieving maximum impact from our limited resources.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There has been some debate among Members in the Chamber and  in the Committee on the process that should be followed in advancing budgetary  matters in the upcoming period. In March 2008, the Executive decided that a strategic  stocktake would be undertaken in place of a comprehensive Budget process for  2008-09. On several occasions, the Committee considered the implications of the  Executive&rsquo;s decision in that regard. On 24 November 2008, the Committee  Chairperson and I met with the Minister to discuss the Committee&rsquo;s concerns.  Subsequently, we agreed that the Minister would make a statement to the  Assembly on the Budget position in the context of the strategic stocktake &mdash;  which he did last week &mdash; and that that would be followed by today&rsquo;s take-note  debate, which will provide Members with the opportunity to deliberate more  fully on the issues. At its meeting on 26 November 2008, the Committee  expressed its satisfaction at that approach and decided not to pursue other  measures.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Last year, the Committee published a co-ordinated report on  the future Budget process. In response to that report, the Committee will be  briefed soon by departmental officials on proposed arrangements for the future  Budget process. Therefore, the process is ongoing, and it is an issue in which  the Committee will take a continued interest.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee agreed its submission on the strategic  stocktake to the Minister on 3 December 2008. That included submissions that  were received from a majority of the Assembly&rsquo;s Statutory Committees. The terms  of reference for the stocktake included a review of departmental progress  against plans; the identification of reduced requirements and emerging  pressures for the next two years; and proposals for addressing the pressures  through adjustments to existing plans and priorities.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee raised concerns in its submission that  Departments had not met the stocktake&rsquo;s terms of reference. Members saw no  evidence of proposals for addressing new pressures through adjustments to  existing plans. That issue was highlighted in several of the submissions that  were received from Statutory Committees. Although that may have been as a  result of Departments being under increased financial pressure, it makes the  job of central finance group and, consequently, the Executive more difficult,  and I urge Statutory Committees to scrutinise that area in the coming months.  The Committee was more concerned about the apparent absence of a critical  review of progress against plans to date. The Committee was particularly  concerned by DFP&rsquo;s assertion that more work is required to provide the  necessary assurances that services are being delivered as planned and that the  majority of public service agreements require improvements in governance and risk  management.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee believes that more management analyses of  expenditure need to be undertaken in Departments and, centrally, by the  Department of Finance and Personnel, and it notes the view of DFP officials  that there is an information gap to be filled to enable such analyses to be  performed. In the current climate of pressure on our resources, it is even more  important that those are directed at the Executive&rsquo;s main priorities and  influenced by progress in achieving PFG targets. The Department of Finance and  Personnel is continuing to examine the arrangements to achieve PFG targets, and  it agreed with the Committee that that should be completed as soon as possible.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Finance and Personnel considers that a  performance management and monitoring framework for Programme for Government  targets will be an extremely important tool to improve analysis and should be  implemented as soon as possible. The Committee believes that failure to deliver  is the main reason for Departments returning reduced requirements in quarterly  monitoring rounds and for year-end underspend. Once established, regular  reports against that framework should be shared with Statutory Committees to  allow their scrutiny role to be enhanced.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">On 26 November 2008, the Committee was briefed by DFP  officials on the issues emerging from departmental stocktake positions. At that  time, the Committee expressed concern at the approximate &pound;1 million difference  between bids submitted and reduced requirements declared to date for 2009-2011.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee accepted DFP&rsquo;s assertion at that time, but  questions remain about the scale of some of the bids; whether they reflect  pressures and whether those making the bids are aware that difficult  negotiations between DFP and other Departments are ongoing. However, the  numbers have not improved since November 2008, and the tables attached to the  Minister&rsquo;s statement last week detailed a similar difference. Therefore, I  again urge Statutory Committees to increase their scrutiny of the proposed pressures  and to seek to prioritise them in conjunction with their respective  Departments. In the current climate of an economic downturn, it is crucial that  Departments do not merely submit wish lists but focus on the identified  pressures.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">DFP officials informed the Committee that they would have  expected more capital reduced requirements to be declared, given the lower cost  of taking forward capital projects as a result of the fall in property prices  and more competitive market conditions for public procurement from the  construction sector. The Committee believes that DFP must do more to identify  such capital projects as soon as possible.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Strategically, the Committee&rsquo;s view is that the economic  downturn and the emerging pressures on the Northern Ireland block grant over  the period of the stocktake mean that it is vital that maximum impact and value  for money be achieved from the available resources. The focus should be on the  implementation of last year&rsquo;s Pannell Kerr Foster (PKF) report, which aims to  improve financial management in the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS).</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">DFP is working on programmes of mandatory financial  training for senior civil servants and on a standard model of financial  information to be made available to Department boards. More must be done to  move from an incremental to an output-based approach to budgeting and  expenditure, as recommended in the PKF report. To that end, the Committee  received a commitment from DFP officials that they would begin a series of  rolling baseline reviews, with the aim of subjecting all departmental  expenditure to that zero-based analysis over three to five years. That analysis  will have a key role to play in future budgetary processes, and its output must  be shared with the relevant Statutory Committees.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the Committee was informed that the Northern Ireland  Civil Service accounting systems are not fit for purpose; DFP, therefore,  expects an improvement in its financial management when financial and  accounting services are provided through Account NI. That process will be fully  implemented by April 2009.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">DFP informed the Committee of the challenges that it faces  in meeting its own efficiency targets for 2009-2010 and 2010-11, and it is  aware that achieving efficiencies is posing problems for other Departments,  too. Statutory Committees&rsquo; scrutiny of efficiencies is not helped by their  outstanding concerns at the level of detail contained in the  efficiency-delivery plans of some Departments &mdash; even though they should have  been published in full early last year.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, DFP recently conducted a review of  efficiency-delivery plans and provided an analysis of its key findings to the  Minister. The Committee for Finance and Personnel has requested a copy of that  analysis, and I urge Statutory Committees to continue to scrutinise plans and  to seek assurance from their respective Departments that savings are being  achieved through carefully planned measures to improve efficiency rather than  through crude cuts in front line services.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The current challenge to meet efficiency targets may be  exacerbated by the Chancellor&rsquo;s announcement, as part of his pre-Budget report,  that efficiency savings for Whitehall Departments will increase by &pound;5 billion  for 2010-11. In November 2008, the Chancellor indicated that those additional  efficiencies will apply to Scotland,  Wales and Northern Ireland.  At an evidence session last week, DFP officials informed the Committee that  that will result in more than &pound;100 million of additional efficiency savings for  Northern Ireland in 2010-11 &mdash; on top of the current target of more than &pound;700  million.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has already said that he intends to challenge  that proposal before the Chancellor&rsquo;s Budget speech in the spring, and he can be  assured of the support of the Committee, and of the wider Assembly, in those  negotiations.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The main pressures on DFP&rsquo;s budget over the two years that  the stocktake covers were identified as relating to NICS reform programmes that  it is progressing on behalf of all Departments. In the Committee&rsquo;s report on  the Executive&rsquo;s draft Budget, published in late 2007, the Committee raised  concerns about the funding of those programmes. We were told that the intention  was to allocate the required money from the 2008-09 monitoring rounds. However,  bids submitted in June and September 2008 were not met, and the Minister  subsequently announced that the collection of rates arrears by Land and  Property Services (LPS) would be used to meet the residual cost of Civil Service  reform.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Given the Committee&rsquo;s continuing concerns about the  performance of LPS &mdash; concerns that Members around the House share &mdash; it will  continue to scrutinise that area to ensure that the cost of essential reforms  are met. Of all the NICS reform programmes, NI Direct probably has the most  impact on public expectation. The Committee has been briefed on that  programme&rsquo;s progress, and it was informed that the identified pressure of just  under &pound;9 million for 2009-2011 will be sufficient to address the total cost of  the programme of some &pound;17&middot;9 million, as planned in the final business case, and  thus ensure delivery of the Programme for Government targets for that  programme.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also notes that DFP did not identify any  reduced requirements as part of its stocktake submission and sees that as a  positive reflection that DFP will use its resources effectively to achieve  targets in that period and, therefore, minimise resources handed back due to  slippage.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee believes that the need to maximise impact on  value for money from finite resources requires DFP to take the lead on  identifying pre-emptive measures to safeguard against significant year-end  underspend. The pattern of Departments declaring reduced requirements late in  the financial year has resulted in unacceptable underspend and  ever-accumulating stocks of end-year flexibility, to which it will become  increasingly difficult to gain access. Given the current economic climate, it  would be intolerable if history were to repeat itself and we were in the same  position at the end of March this year.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee will wish to see continuous improvement in  the performance of the public sector in managing programmes, finances and other  resources and in achieving business targets. Individual Statutory Committees,  and the wider Assembly, have an important role to play in driving that  improvement forward.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, in the time left to me, I will make some  personal remarks on the strategic stocktake. Like many Members, I view the  strategic stocktake as a valuable exercise in theory, given the economic  climate. It was an opportunity &mdash; as it says on the tin &mdash; to take stock in a  strategic way and to assess the state of public finances in Northern Ireland.  Unfortunately, that has not necessarily been the case in practice in two  particular areas. First, as I said earlier, the terms of reference have, at  times, been ignored by Departments. There was little evidence that Departments  were seeking to identify pressures and consider how they could be met from  adjustments from their own plans. Secondly, Departments submitted what were, in  effect, wish lists. The process may have been concluded before Christmas, but  there was no excuse for some Departments submitting what were, in effect, Dear  Santa letters and demanding infinite amounts of money that simply did not  exist.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The figures show &pound;52 million of reduced requirements  against more than &pound;1 billion of bids. The monitoring round in December had &pound;70  million available and some &pound;300 million of bids. I have heard criticism of a  supposed black hole in the public finances of Northern Ireland. The more I hear  of that criticism, the more I am inclined to believe that there is a black  hole. However, it is not in public finances; it is in the heads of Members who  raise that issue. It does them no service whatsoever to start scare stories  about schools&rsquo; budgets being hit and money for education and other front line  services being affected. If those Members scrutinised what is going on, they  would see that that is not the case. The insinuation that there is a black hole  would suggest that it is somehow hidden. The Minister can confirm that he has  in no way hidden any of the pressures on bids that have come on our public  finances.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is a duty on those who say that there is a black hole  to look at the validity of some of the bids to see whether they are priorities,  whether they are absolutely needed, whether they are urgent, and whether they  are required at all in some cases.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Asking Ministers to submit bids for what they would like to  see implemented over the next couple of years is akin to my going home this  evening and asking Mrs Hamilton what she would like me to buy. I am sure that  she would say that she would like two new cars, five foreign holidays a year  and a brand new wardrobe.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span> She might  have to take a bit of a cut in what she would like. There are massive demands  on every domestic budget, but that does not mean that that expenditure is  necessarily valid, correct or right.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The behaviour of some Departments in respect of this  stocktake undermines the argument that some have made for a revised and new  Budget process as well. It is clear from the stocktake that these are difficult  economic times and that there is no new money available. A revised Budget  process would require taking money from other Departments.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have heard many demands for money, but I have not heard  any constructive suggestions from Members as to where that money should come  from. Those are important thoughts for Members to ponder; however, I am not  optimistic that they will be taken on board. I commend the motion to the House.</p>        
        <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to take  part in today&rsquo;s debate. The strategic stocktake offers us the opportunity to  have some input to the budgetary process, and it allows us to highlight some of  the priorities that have been affected by the serious economic decline.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am a member of the Committee for Social Development, which  has supported increased expenditure for a social housing programme to deal with  the ever-increasing numbers of people waiting for a home. In fact, Sinn F&eacute;in  has argued that to invest in social housing is to invest in the future of those  who are most in need in our society. Having a home raises our quality of life  and impacts on our educational attainment and health. We in the Chamber have a  duty to ensure that citizens who find themselves without a home can feel part  of this new dispensation, and that can be done only by providing a home for  them to live in.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Over many monitoring rounds, the Executive have shown their  commitment to the provision of a social-housing newbuild programme. The  Programme for Government set out the commitment to provide more than 5,000 new  homes over the next three years. Any slip in that schedule would have a  devastating effect on those waiting to be housed. The Minister for Social Development  must realise that everyone in the Chamber is a supporter of providing an  effective social housing programme. In fact, we have congratulated Ministers on  providing additional moneys for housing in most of the monitoring rounds that  have taken place since the Assembly was restored.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, rather than arguing a case with her ministerial  colleagues, the Social Development Minister has chosen to attack them, even  though she supported the package of proposals &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. I welcome his support for the provision of the  money that is necessary for social housing. Can the Member be explicit: is he  encouraging the Minister of Finance and Personnel to make good next year the  deficit in the housing budget this year? Furthermore, is he asking the Finance  Minister to ensure that the money that was allocated for social housing for the  next two years will, in fact, be handed over?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention. The Minister argued that the December  monitoring round was a smash-and-grab raid on her budget, when, in fact, not a  penny was lost from her social housing budget. When we consider the previous  three monitoring rounds, we can see that the Minister has underspent her  budget. In June, she surrendered &pound;50 million from social security, which the  Executive allowed to be transferred to a social housing development programme.  In September, she bid for &pound;68&middot;4 million, and she was given &pound;15&middot;5 million, plus  &pound;15 million from sales. In December, she surrendered over &pound;31 million from  social security, which went into the pot to tackle the serious economic crisis  that we face.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>:  No.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Could that money not have been used to bring forward  newbuild programmes planned for social security offices? That would have  provided a much-needed injection of resources into the construction industry  and would have dealt with the serious morale problems among social security  staff.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We could be forgiven for thinking that housing is the only  brief in the Minister&rsquo;s Department, but she is also responsible for dealing  with need and social deprivation. At a time when many community and voluntary  groups working on neighbourhood renewal across the North are under severe  financial pressure, the Minister gave back &pound;1&middot;6 million from that budget in  December. Why was that money not reallocated to halt the job losses in that  sector or the closure of projects?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>:  No.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The strategic business review is another example of  proposed changes and potential job losses, and I ask the Minister to consider  that again, and then do the decent thing and scrap it. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith  agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I wish to inform the House that the motion has been tabled without legal advice  being given to the Committee for Finance and Personnel. In November, a proposal  to seek legal advice was voted on, but because two parties can outvote four  parties &mdash; and did so by five votes to four &mdash; the proposal to seek legal advice  on the strategic stocktake was summarily rejected by the DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in  coalition that operates here. That begs a question: did DFP take legal advice  on the introduction of a strategic stocktake in the first place? Perhaps we are  on shaky ground, because last week in the House, the First Minister told us of  the rock-solid commitment to the Programme for Government and its link to a  three-year Budget.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, according to the Finance Minister&rsquo;s remarks on the  same day, it seems that all is not so rosy. His concerns are not alleviated by  unified corporate ministerial action. On the contrary, the Finance Minister is  petrified to find himself entirely at the mercy of arrogant and ruthless Ministers.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Talking of which, before I set the First Minister aside,  how is it that despite having fewer staff than it did five years ago and the  smallest of budgets, his Department has increased its monthly payroll by more  than &pound;330,000 in five years, to a staggering &pound;1,395,448? Why is it that, as of  last week, OFMDFM was the only Department yet to return a report on its  efficiency savings? How many times have Members been berated in the Chamber by  OFMDFM about efficiency savings?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, the media headlines agreed with my assertions  about the existence of a billion-pound black hole &mdash; it even got its own cartoon  in the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo;. The media cannot all be wrong. Yet, the Minister  denies that such a hole exists. How deep, and what colour, is the pit? Is it a  vivid red to match the forecast figures that he cannot see? What will he do  when it dawns on him that the strategy behind his strategic stocktake was  flawed in the first place? The Minister talks of pressures like an inventive  diversion, because he is dependent on underspending to reduce those pressures.  On the one hand, he pleads that there is a difficulty in predicting and  measuring pressures, yet on the other, he boldly states that recent history  shows that whatever the pressures are, they are manageable. In other words, the  Minister hopes that underspending will save his bacon.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We know that the hole was created long before the downturn  kicked in &mdash; it was always going to manifest itself. However, its impact will be  worse in the current circumstances, and only DFP, Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP argue  otherwise. We are left with a Minister who is stuck with an inherited economic  landscape and glued rigidly to yesterday&rsquo;s plan. He seeks salvation through  in-year monitoring, but shakes at the very thought of Ministers spending every  penny of their budget allocations and having nothing left on the books. That is  a very risky high-wire strategy, which, if unearthed and proven &mdash; and it may be  soon &mdash; is nothing short of negligence and incompetence.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">What are we taking note of today? Is there some type of  poker game in progress, in which Ministers hold or fold? If so, the Minister is  sticking with an outdated and ineffective Programme for Government and the  corresponding Budget that he was dealt. We will be back in the Chamber soon for  a proper debate, on which there will be a vote to test the two-party coalition  and, not least, the nerve of the Assembly. It is crystal clear that we must  rewrite a new creative action that fits today&rsquo;s circumstances. It is time to  take note of those requirements and to remove the old remedies.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  To summarise the outcome of the strategic stocktake, the Minister has sat long  and produced a mouse. Incredibly, the Minister&rsquo;s statement did not offer a  single new initiative or change of direction, yet it is called &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; &mdash;  that is an affront to the English language. At most, this statement was a  survey of the financial and economic landscape. It is a bleak landscape, and  there is no chart of it. The Minister is certainly no Shackleton.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We all know that we are in a very serious economic  situation, and there have been major changes since the three-year Budget was  created in autumn 2007. Every day, we hear reports of job losses. Also, there  is a credit crunch, and businesses cannot get the money to invest. There is a  lack of confidence and uncertainty. The business world is looking to the  Executive for leadership, but it is not getting it in the Minister&rsquo;s statement.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members might have seen an article by John Simpson in  yesterday&rsquo;s &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo;. I do not think that many people regard him as  polemical or as an anti-establishment commentator, but he agrees very much that  the Minister needs to do more. His article is headlined: &ldquo;Time to reshape  budget to tackle the downturn&rdquo;. In it, he states that the Executive need to  move on with plans to revitalise the local economy. I could not agree more.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">John Simpson is very specific. He advocates shifting a  further &pound;50 million to &pound;100 million within the Budget. His first focus is on  enhanced skilling and retraining.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I can anticipate where the Member&rsquo;s speech is going. If he is advocating moving  &pound;50 million to &pound;100 million, will he tell us which Ministers will be told that  their budgets are going to be slashed by that amount?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: There  is no question that in calling for a revised Budget, all of that would have to  be looked at. I am saying that the Executive, through the Minister of Finance  and Personnel, must reconsider their priorities. I am perfectly open about that  when I make that statement.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Moving &pound;50 million to &pound;100 million into enhanced skilling  and retraining would be a meaningful response to give when many people around  us are losing jobs. However, the Minister has not responded in such a way.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">John Simpson has also called for the capital programme to  be confirmed and enhanced. From where will the money come when capital  realisation has dried up? People are aware that there is a problem with the &pound;260  million acute hospital in Enniskillen and that HSBC has pulled out of the PFI  scheme, but the Minister has told us nothing of such problems or of the  remedies for them. In fact, he has said nothing at all on such matters.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s officials agree that something needs to be  done about the Budget. At the Finance Committee last week, a senior official  said:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Some spending programmes initiated a year or more ago  were valid spending programmes in the context that applied at that time. In the  different economic and political context that now exists, some of those  programmes might have run their course.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">There is no better argument than that for a revised  Budget. That is what the Minister should be presenting, but he has not done so.  The Minister has failed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Officials have told us that the major pressures on the  Budget are water charges and equal pay. In relation to water charges, the  Minister has lost &pound;200 million from his Budget for the next two years. The  total pressures on the Budget are &pound;1 billion over two years, and what is the  Minister&rsquo;s answer to that? Incredibly, his officials told us clearly that his  answer is to ignore half of that, as it is just bluff from the Departments,  which are simply fluffing up demands into material that is not real.  Nevertheless, that leaves a substantial amount. However, half of &pound;1 billion is  &pound;500 million, over two years, so what is the answer to that? The Minister&rsquo;s  officials told us that there are always reduced requirements year on year &mdash;  they say that what they call the &ldquo;churn&rdquo; will deal with it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That is all that the Minister has to say in response to the  biggest economic crisis in our lifetimes. The Minister&rsquo;s response is this:  something will turn up.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  I wish to address some comments that were directed previously at our party  colleague and Minister, Margaret Ritchie, from Members to the right  geographically, in the Chamber, and politically, in terms of the Thatcherite  right. They supported a Budget that will ultimately lead to cuts in childcare  and that made no provision for an anti-poverty strategy, which we have heard  much about today.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In other words, the Budget that they brought about and  supported is leading to the underprovision of resources and is counteracting  the measures that deal with poverty.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  will pick up where Mr O&rsquo;Loan left off. The point is well made, if I may speak  on behalf of the SDLP &mdash; I was amazed that Sinn F&eacute;in signed up to the Budget  last year.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The stocktake has exposed serious problems in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  public finances. Although it is relatively easy to point the finger at the  economic downturn, in the sense that it is a convenient scapegoat, the reality  is much different, because the problems are in some way self-inflicted. At the  outset, many questions were asked about the Budget and whether it was capable  of meeting all its stated objectives. Since then, further wounds have been  caused by Executive decisions.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The existing budgetary framework in Northern Ireland  is already very tight. Members would expect me to say that the cost of division  causes difficulties in that major opportunity costs are incurred because  resources are tied up in providing duplicate facilities. However, I will not  labour that point; it has been well made many times in the past. On top of  that, we had to deal with the UK Treasury&rsquo;s difficult and tight comprehensive  spending review. When that is coupled with the existing structural problems in  public expenditure, the situation gets even more difficult.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive&rsquo;s decisions have drawn the Budget even  tighter, leaving little room for manoeuvre and large expectations with regard  to efficiency savings and asset sales. Efficiency savings are a popular topic  of discussion across the country. To me, efficiency savings are about changes  in policies and practices &mdash; we should do things differently and more  effectively. Far too often, efficiency savings are becoming simple cuts in  public services, with the result that we are just doing less, and the reaction  across the board to that is extreme.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I note that the DUP has tabled a motion about the Health  Service in which it calls for proper efficiency savings rather than cuts. You  reap what you sow, and the DUP has a barefaced cheek to table that motion. The  situation in the Health Service is a direct outworking of the Budget that the  DUP designed and supported, and it should not be surprised by what is happening  in the Health Service.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Populism has been placed ahead of prudence, and that can be  seen in the number of big announcements and headline figures that the Executive  have produced. There is a revenue funding gap of &pound;450 million over the next two  years, more than half of which is due to the decision to defer water charges.  Furthermore, there is a capital funding gap of &pound;610 million. I appreciate that  the Minister said that those gaps can be closed via underspends in previous  years, but even if we take the midpoints of those underspends over the past two  years, that still raises only &pound;740 million, leaving a gap of &pound;360 million. We  must acknowledge that we are in a sui generis situation and that past  assumptions about under&shy;spends may not come to pass. Beyond that, Departments  are required to surrender money in a timely manner if the gap is to be plugged  and if they are to avoid losing funds at the end of the year. Other demands to  spend money will emerge over time; this stocktake has not foreseen all the  challenges that will arise.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister and his party colleagues made a point about  lecturing MLAs for making proposals for funding without identifying where the  money will come from. That is a perfectly fair point to make, but I would turn  that back on to the DUP and point out that in making its decisions, it has done  exactly that which it preached against. The decision to defer water charges for  two years cost well over &pound;200 million, but the resources to facilitate it were  not in place. That decision may be right and it may be popular, but it has been  made without regard to the available resources. The same thing applies to the  health budget, which has first call on the monitoring rounds.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The real damage to the Budget may not be the effect on our  ability to plug gaps &mdash; I am sure that those can be patched over in some shape  or form &mdash; but to the opportunity costs of investing in our economy at a time  when Governments around the world are seeing the need, not just to mitigate the  effects of the downturn, but to invest for recovery. Northern Ireland is standing still  because our Budget is not capable of producing the necessary investments that  must be made in order to rebalance our economy.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Is the Member aware of the financial mismanagement by the Minister of  Education, the result of which is that the schools capital programme will be  &pound;90 million out of line with the resources needed for the 100 major schools  projects that are in the pipeline? Failure to secure additional resources will  mean that some projects must be slowed down or stopped, at a time when children  need the best possible learning environments and when the building industry could  do with the work that those projects would mean.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  concur with the Member. I know of huge frustrations across the board with  respect to capital spending on education projects, which should be going ahead,  but are not for various reasons. That points both to the challenge of current  capital spending, and to that of bringing forward proper investments. We have  had a useful debate on the green economy and renewables, but we are not doing  enough on those matters. The action does not match the rhetoric.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hilditch)</strong>: I wish  to comment, on the Committee&rsquo;s behalf, on certain aspects of the strategic  stocktake. The Committee considered the Department for Social Development&rsquo;s  strategic stocktake submission at its meetings on 16 and 23 October 2008.  Additionally, the Minister for Social Development briefed the Committee on the  funding issues relating to the social housing development programme, and other  Housing Executive programmes, on 15 January 2009.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The public service agreement targets for housing include  the provision of 10,000 additional social and affordable homes by 2013, and the  improvement of energy efficiency and other standards in existing social  housing. To achieve those goals, the Department set itself annual targets for  new house starts and improvements to existing social housing. In the current  financial year, the new house starts and the new home improvement targets are  likely to be missed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Those outcomes, should they arise, would be most unwelcome.  Such a setback at such an early stage of the new housing programme is  regrettable, and it will be important that the Department makes up the housing  stock over the next 12 months. The possible failure to achieve social housing  improvements is also most undesirable. However, the Committee understands that some  &pound;10 million has been identified to ease the problem.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The problem is funding. Social housing programmes were to  be funded by land and property sales but, as everyone knows, land and property  throughout Northern Ireland  have been seriously and significantly devalued. As a consequence, the  Department&rsquo;s housing programmes face a shortfall of around &pound;140 million.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We all recognise that there will always be more pressures  than easements. Why, when funds are so limited and when there is such a  significant economic downturn, should precious resources be redirected to  housing programmes? The Committee for Social Development suggests that housing  represents a special case. Additional social and affordable housing will not  only serve a social purpose, but will provide additional economic benefits. New  and improved social and affordable housing will mean building activity, jobs,  and spending in the construction industry and in the local economy generally.  Investing in housing is therefore a value-added spending option.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Social Development Committee agrees unanimously that to  deliver on the public service agreement targets for housing, the Department  will require additional financial support. There are other social pressures on  the Department, which include the mortgage-rescue and mortgage-interest-support  schemes. Both provide an important safety net for homeowners who find  themselves unable to pay their mortgages. The extent of the financial support  that may be required for those schemes over the next two years is, unlike the  sums required for the housing programmes, hard to predict. It is important that  future monitoring rounds include some flexibility to support those schemes over  the next two years.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Notwithstanding what I have said, the Committee supports  the view, expressed by the DFP Minister, that the Department should consider  all funding options and meet resource requirements, where possible, from  internal sources.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">All the Committee Chairpersons who speak today will welcome  the DFP Minister&rsquo;s exhortation that Committees should challenge Departments&rsquo;  spending plans and priorities. On behalf of the Social Development Committee, I  assure the House that we will continue to make suggestions, and scrutinise and  challenge DSD spending plans and priorities during these difficult times.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Ms S Ramsey)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I will speak to this motion as Chairperson of the  Committee for Employment and Learning. I thank the Chairperson and the  Committee for Finance and Personnel for bringing this vital issue to the House  and giving Members the opportunity to debate and discuss it. It is important  that the Committee created this opportunity for issues to be discussed in the  House.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The strategic stocktake must be seen against the backdrop  of the growing economic downturn in which we, like so many other parts of the  world, find ourselves. This situation cannot be said to be of our own making.  This downturn is not the same as those of the boom-and-bust cycles of previous  decades. This downturn is a result of an adjustment to the global banking and  credit system, and creative solutions are required in order to bolster the  local economy and to protect the most vulnerable in society. We must also  continue to invest in skills, training and innovation so that we are well placed  to make progress on jobs and the economy when the downturn ends.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Those issues must not be forgotten in our consideration of  the strategic stocktake. The Committee for Employment and Learning has been at  the forefront of highlighting the effect of the economic downturn here. The  impact of the redundancies about which we seem to hear on a daily basis will be  felt by the Department for Employment and Learning, which provides a range of  demand-led skills and training-focused initiatives. Those programmes will see  increased uptake as the economic downturn continues to bite, and the Committee  signals its approval of the uplifts in the Department for Employment and  Learning&rsquo;s budget over the remainder of this financial cycle. That is not to  say, however, that the Committee will not be scrutinising the fallout of the  Department&rsquo;s reduced requirements.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has consistently promoted the message that,  in this time of hardship, it is vital that investment in up-skilling and  re-skilling workers continues and expands, and that those who are made  redundant are not left idle and without hope. The Committee for Employment and  Learning will also follow the progress of the considerable capital investment  set out by the Department over the remainder of the financial cycle. We urge  other Committees to ensure that capital projects are not allowed to slip,  because they will bring much-needed jobs to our beleaguered construction, and  allied, industries.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We should be assessing the up-and-coming industries now,  and putting in place training that is appropriate to those industries. That  will allow us to be quick off the mark when the upturn finally comes. We will  be first in the queue with a skilled workforce, and to capitalise on any  opportunities that come our way. The economic downturn makes the sensible use  of our budgets all the more important. On behalf of the Committee, I again  thank the Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel, and the  Committee itself, for giving Members the opportunity to say a few words. Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to speak in this important debate. Every Minister has  a very difficult period ahead as a result of the economic downturn, and all  Departments will be under pressure.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to concentrate on the public housing sector. I  understand that the Minister for Social Development has a problem in that the  income that the Department expected from the sale of property will be reduced  because of the current economic climate. However, the Minster of Finance and  Personnel has made great efforts to assist her by providing an additional &pound;20  million as part of the in-year monitoring process. That should address the core  function of any Government in ensuring that people have decent housing and  affordable rent. On a more positive note, however, the economic downturn  presents an opportunity for the Minister to get more for every pound that she  spends on social housing. I urge the Minister to ensure that that is a reality.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members have decided to twist the facts to try to make  out that the Minister of Finance and Personnel has deprived the Department for  Social Development of funding. Every Member and every Minister knows that the  Department submitted bids for funding way in excess of what was going to be the  reality. Those seven bids were, I believe, for almost twice the moneys  available. Therefore, I hope that members of the Minister&rsquo;s party will come  clean and admit that the Department for Social Development and social housing  are very much a priority for the Executive.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that there are still tough choices to  make, but they must be made based on fact, not on speculation and political  agendas. There is no doubt that the economy will take time to recover, and that  it will, effectively, budget plans for some time. Therefore, all Departments  must make their core targets those that were set out in the Programme for  Government. However, it is a relief that we have a steady hand on the financial  wheel at the Department of Finance and Personnel to ensure that those targets  are met without lumbering future generations with debts, which some Members  think that we should take on and expect our children and grandchildren to pay  for. I support the motion.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  The Committee has considered the Department of the Environment&rsquo;s submission for  the strategic stocktake, and I am stating Committee members&rsquo; concerns that the  Department anticipates relinquishing more than &pound;185 million in this budgeting  period. That is a significant expenditure.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department made a bid for &pound;200 million for the  budgetary period 2008-2011 to provide funding for councils to cover up to 50%  of the overall capital costs of compliance with the EU landfill directive  targets. The Committee has been advised by the Department that the three waste  management groups established to address the waste management needs of the  North&rsquo;s 26 councils have not been in place long enough to be able to use the resources  that have been made available by the strategic waste infrastructure fund. The  Department now wants &mdash; on its terms &mdash; to re-phase the money into the next  budgetary period.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Dodds referred to that unspent money in his strategic  stocktake statement last week. He stopped short of giving a commitment that  sufficient funding would be found for waste management in the next budgeting  round. That is particularly worrying when considered alongside the fact that  there is likely to be a net reduction in the block grant &mdash; relative to the  position when the budget was agreed last January &mdash; over the period 2009-2011.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The importance of waste management must not be  underestimated. We are obliged to meet statutory targets to reduce the impact  of our waste. By 2020, 50% of our household waste must be recycled, and the  amount of biological municipal waste going to landfill must be reduced to 35%  of that produced in 1995. Those targets will not only be challenging to us over  the next decade, there are obligatory intermediate milestones to be met in 2010  and 2013, which will be used to indicate that we are moving in the right  direction to meet the goals set for 2020.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The three waste partnership groups have told the Committee  that there is a long and complex road ahead to establish the structures and  policies necessary for the North to meet those waste management commitments. It  is essential that reassurance is given that the necessary funding will be  available in the next budgetary period in order to facilitate that. Without it,  we will create difficulties for our local councils, which are responsible for  waste management; for our citizens, who are trying to deal with their own  waste, and for the long-term financial position of the North should penalties  emanate from Europe for failure to comply with  the EU waste directives.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My Committee has also scrutinised the emerging pressures  identified in the strategic stocktake by the Department of the Environment. The  inescapable requirements of just over &pound;11 million for a range of issues were  deemed to be necessary and were supported by members. The Committee believes  that the reallocation of the Department&rsquo;s underspend is very unfortunate, and  should have been avoided.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee urges the Minister of Finance and Personnel  to recognise the importance of reinstating the necessary funding in the next  budgeting period. It supports the Department in the recognition of the emerging  pressures of &pound;11 million and accepts those as valid and necessary.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will now speak in my capacity as a constituency MLA. The  Executive, as a responsible Government, must start to prove themselves by  supporting increased investment in our construction industry. We are  experiencing growing homelessness and Housing Executive maintenance needs.  There is a growing need also for increased investment in newbuilds. We need to  ensure that people, many of whom are living in inadequate housing at the  moment, have proper and decent homes, and that there are proper maintenance  budgets. We need to get people, many of whom are now unemployed for the first  time, back into work.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I have listened very carefully to what the Member has said about housing in  particular. Does he agree that, over the next two years, there will be a  shortfall in the region of &pound;200 million in the housing budget? Does he also  agree that it is therefore necessary that the Budget be revisited and that  there should be a major reprioritisation of the Budget objectives?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment</strong>: I agree with my colleague: it is a  no-brainer. Everybody &mdash; from those in the various construction organisations,  to tradesmen, suppliers or builders&rsquo; merchants &mdash; is saying the same thing to  us.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A less difficult way to kick-start any economy is to invest  in construction and maintenance. People are crying out for housing and for  work. Let us make the investment and get back to basics by doing what any other  Government would do, which is to respond immediately, albeit in a relatively  small measure in world economic terms. If that starts the process of bringing  people &mdash; be it those now doing part-time work, claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance,  or forced to take sick leave &mdash; back into meaningful full-time work, as they  understand it and see as traditional, it is not only the right thing to do  economically, it is the right thing to do morally.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  We are all familiar with the story of the farmer who, when stopped by a group  of tourists and asked for directions, said, &ldquo;Well, if I were you, I would not  start from here.&rdquo; The Minister of Finance and Personnel probably feels like  that farmer; if he wanted to try to put Northern Ireland on a particular  economic footing, he would not choose to start with the hand that he was dealt.  Rather, he would choose to start with a clean slate and from a better economic  basis.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Let us be clear; absolutely no one predicted the economic  downturn &mdash; no one in the House and no one in the Executive, least of all the  Minister for Social Development. That is what amazes me about the points that  have been made by the party opposite; those Members claim that we could find a  way out of the crisis in Northern    Ireland if only we had a different Budget  settlement. The fact is that the Minister for Social Development helped to  negotiate the Budget; she endorsed it at Executive level, in private  conversations around the table; and she walked into the Lobby in support of it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That is why we have an economic plan for the next three  years that will allow us to take on board a strategy that will help Northern Ireland  get from where it is to where it wants to be. Everyone accepts that the Finance  Minister&rsquo;s room for manoeuvre is limited; however, I commend the excellent job  that is being done.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the contributions to economic debates in the House  have been very good. Unfortunately, however, there are some Members who persist  in scoring cheap points or in defending their Minster as the only person who  can sort out all the problems in Northern Ireland &mdash; that is rather  juvenile. I am a member of the Committee for Finance and Personnel, and, week  in, week out, instead of hearing a strategic argument to resolve Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  problems, I hear a single argument &mdash; a mantra &mdash; from the SDLP: build social  housing. In other words, give Margaret Ritchie more money, because she  mismanaged the money that she had. That is the bottom line, and that is all  that we hear from the SDLP.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  No.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Pengelly came to the Committee for Finance and Personnel  last week, and I will quote his words from the Hansard report, instead of the  paraphrased remarks that some Members have given us. He said:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the Budget ... was agreed by the Executive and  approved by the Assembly in January ... The downturn in the market, when it  happened, took us all by surprise. With the benefit of hindsight, most people  can offer a full and detailed articulation of the whys and wherefores of a  situation.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I think that we see that to be true today. Everyone on the  other side of the House has, with hindsight, the answer to resolving the  situation. The problem is that they did not predict it, or support the  policies, at the time.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Now, at a time of crisis, they panic. The only way out,  they claim, is to renegotiate the entire Budget. How stupid would that be for  the Heath Service, and for every other Government service? The only thing that  the SDLP wants to do is build social houses. With a trowel in one hand and a  brick in the other, Minster Margaret will solve the problems of the world. I  almost believe that all it would take to fix the damage to the ozone layer  would be for Margaret Ritchie to write to Al Gore and suggest building social  housing. She is Minister Habitat for Humanity; the Minister of building houses  to solve problems. We need more than the SDLP&rsquo;s sub-kindergarten approach to  those matters.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that that approach will start to be taken, rather  than the nonsense that has been talked about.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, I heard commentators run away with themselves  and say that there is a billion-pound black hole in the economy. That  characterisation of our Budget is nothing short of a black lie, because there  is no such black hole. A strategy is in place to address the problems in the  economy, and it must not be forgotten that the total amount of capital  expenditure and investment this year will be around &pound;1&middot;5 billion. That is the  largest amount in a single year in the history of Northern Ireland. Some of us are  trying to see that the economic problems are addressed, and addressed properly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If a black hole exists in any economy, it is south of the  border, where the Celtic tiger has become the Celtic pussycat. In the weeks  ahead, I hope that more people come from the South to spend their money in our  economy and on driving our country forward.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to  participate in the debate. The main purpose of the strategic stocktake was to  assess the overall financial position in advance of the 2009-2010 in-year  monitoring process. It considered several issues, including departmental  progress against action plans, the identification of reduced requirements, and  emerging pressures for the next two years. Over the past few weeks, some of  those issues have been discussed in the Assembly. The need for financial and  project management in Departments, which would help them to meet their targets,  has been discussed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly has also discussed the need for Departments to  identify the reduced requirements early, in order to ensure that the  end-of-year accumulation can be redirected and spent on other priorities. The  economic downturn and the mounting pressures on end-year flexibility are  elements of concern, and, as was said earlier, a big pot of money is not  available. Therefore, the money that is available must be used as carefully as  possible, and we must identify where to prioritise the money &mdash; collectively.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">No Member can fail to have been affected by the current  economic downturn, the sharp rise in unemployment and the number of businesses  that has had to close or go into receivership. Although it must be recognised  that that big pot of money is not available, people still have expectations of  the Assembly to deliver the changes that are necessary to try to offset some of  the difficulties that they are experiencing.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in believes that the block grant from the British  Government is inadequate, and, in the context of that financial shortfall and  in the absence of a developed all-island economy, we will continue to carry the  burden of trying to match limited resources with the increasing needs of people  until we have control over our own fiscal powers.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The recent injection of public money to steady the banks  has not cascaded to businesses or the consumer. Some banks are now under public  ownership, and many others are being supported by millions of pounds of public  money. I know that some Members have met representatives from the banks to try  challenge that, and that must continue. Money is still not readily available,  particularly for businesses.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have already set out their commitment to seek  to maximise social and employment opportunities for everyone, particularly  through their public-procurement process. That is an essential part of the  investment strategy, because it is now more important than ever that that  opportunity be grasped. Existing jobs must be secured, and new jobs must be  created for the people who have lost theirs. Public procurement in works,  services and goods, equality of opportunity and value for money can all be  incorporated into contracts to meet conditions, including good wages and  employment of apprentices. That will contribute to local economic welfare and  growth.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Small and medium-sized enterprises account for almost 99%  of businesses in the North, yet almost three quarters of them, including those  from the social-economy sector, do not even apply for public-procurement  contracts, because they feel that the tendering stage of the process is stacked  against them and weighted firmly in favour of larger companies. An opportunity  exists to develop on that. The advancement of capital-build projects for which  Departments have already budgeted must also be a priority.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">During this debate, and during debates over the past week,  it has become clear that some parties are adopting narrow party political  agendas, as well as a silo mentality in which Ministers seek to protect their  party&rsquo;s interests.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In doing so, they abdicate their collective  responsibilities as part of the Executive &mdash; an approach that has already been  evidenced in the House by the behaviour of Ministers whose parties have  publicly adopted oppositional roles. Other Ministers, however, set a good  example by demonstrating that, if the political will, leadership and skills  exist, it is possible to achieve results outside their party constraints.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Is the Member aware that the Minister of Education has, to date, failed to  budget for teacher redundancies, to the extent of &pound;20 million? That means that  the education and library boards, as the compensating authorities for teachers  in controlled and maintained schools, do not have the resources to facilitate  redundancies. If those resources are not secured, schools will be plunged into  crisis, and teachers will face the spectre of unplanned, compulsory redundancy,  with all the consequent disruption to schools. Is that the type of good management  to which the Member refers?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That was quite a long intervention. The Member can have an extra  minute. However, I encourage Members to keep their interventions short.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention in the form of a prepared speech.  However, Ministers must not be allowed to abdicate their responsibilities by  insisting that they simply do not have enough money. We face many tough  choices, and unless we develop greater fiscal freedom and strengthen the local  economy, many difficulties lie ahead. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Much criticism has been levelled in the debate at my party over its stance on  the strategic stocktake, which is little more than a descriptive exercise. It  certainly has no serious prescriptive element. On that basis alone, it is right  and proper to criticise that particular exercise by the Minister of Finance and  Personnel. Furthermore, none of us in the Chamber could have predicted the  radical change in economic and financial circumstances that has taken place  since the Assembly approved the original three-year Budget.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We regard our position as being very reasonable. First, I  reiterate that we, quite rightly, opposed the Budget for reasons that we  outlined at the time. Secondly, it contained various flaws, but one of the main  criticisms of the Budget was that it was based on the realisation of capital  assets. We do not resile from that position. However, even were we to do so &mdash;  we will not &mdash; it remains necessary to revisit the Budget.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot think of any other legislature on these islands or  in Europe that does not have an annual Budget  process. It is most unusual and abnormal not to have such a process. I say to  the Minister of Finance and Personnel, and to colleagues in other parties, that,  sooner or later, we will revisit the Budget, because of the dire economic and  financial circumstances in which we find ourselves.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">On 23 January, Mr John Armstrong of the Construction  Employers Federation warned that we are facing a serious crisis. He stated that  the depth of that crisis could be measured by the fact that, in all  probability, there will be 30,000 people unemployed in the construction  industry by the summer.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Mr Paisley Jnr, in an attack on my colleague Margaret Ritchie for daring to  care about people who are homeless, for daring to care about those 30,000  people potentially out of work &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.] &mdash; </span>Mr  Paisley Jnr finds the matter enjoyable and laughable, which is disgraceful. He  should apologise to homeless people and to people who face potential  unemployment. His behaviour in the Chamber is an utter disgrace.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I must reiterate what I said to Mr Bradley. The Member will have  an extra minute added to his time.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I welcome the timely intervention by my good  friend Mr McGlone.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Armstrong maintains that 30,000 construction workers  will be unemployed by summer 2009. He has said on behalf of his organisation  that the Government must take immediate action, which he characterises as  &ldquo;urgent and unprecedented intervention&rdquo;, which is required to safeguard the  industry.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If people do not accept my party&rsquo;s critical view of the housing  sector and, indeed, of the wider construction sector, I urge them to listen to  the views of Mr Armstrong and the Construction Employers Federation, which is  clear and which happens to correspond closely with the view that the SDLP has  expressed in the Chamber during the past several months.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My party has taken soundings from people throughout the  North of Ireland. We have listened to builders, tradesmen, suppliers, engineers  and professional people who are involved in the construction industry. They are  crying out for Government intervention &mdash; whether it be in Derry, Fermanagh,  Armagh, mid Ulster, or  anywhere in Northern Ireland.  They want to see significant investment in social housing. That is the demand  from people who know what is required to revive the economy and for society to  climb out of the depths of recession.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, the old Budget must be revisited. The  Assembly cannot rely on Micawber&rsquo;s approach and hope that something will turn  up. The fact is that action is required and that the Budget process must be  revisited in a radical way. If people do not believe me and my party  colleagues, they must listen to the Construction Employers Federation.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The Assembly has been asked to examine budgets and identify pressures in order  to determine whether there is a problem. When I examine the stocktake, I see  that there is severe pressure on the Department of Education in particular. I  accept that the material is published and that people are aware of it.  Nevertheless, all Departments have pressures. In respect of the Department of  Education, there is pressure of &pound;50 million during the coming year, and &pound;45  million next year. There are also difficulties with phasing capital  expenditure.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister of Finance and Personnel pointed out in his  statement, the key point is that resources are tight and if the Assembly cannot  persuade the Prime Minister or the Chancellor to honour the CSR, there will be  serious problems. There are serious problems already. Services are at risk if  money cannot be found. I understand that every other Department has similar  pressures. I understand that instead of getting &pound;80 million from land sales in  2008, DSD received only &pound;10 million, and will receive only &pound;10 million in 2009.  I understand that there is pressure throughout Departments. However, many of  the figures in the Department of Education&rsquo;s budget are inescapables. They  relate to reviews of job evaluations, pensions, and so on. That money must be  found &mdash; if it is not, it will mean cuts in services.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am particularly concerned about provisions for pensions  and early voluntary redundancy. Previously, around &pound;60 million was paid in  respect of those provisions. That figure is now around &pound;20 million. If teachers  cannot be incentivised to take voluntary redundancy, efficiency savings of 3%  will not be made.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Worse than that, the latest census figures tell us that  pupil numbers have not fallen as we had thought. Indeed, those figures are  higher that we thought, meaning that we will not be able to get rid of the  teachers who want to go &mdash; we will certainly not be able to pay them. In considering  the challenges that face us, the education and skills authority budget  proposals factor in a wage inflation of 25% over a three-year period, albeit in  only a small part of the education budget. That 25% figure reflects the  reality, but it is only 2% in our budget in the CSR.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are other issues that I hope that the Minister of  Finance and Personnel will be able to address. One of those concerns the  much-touted problems that are associated with the framework arrangements, the  cost of which I understand to be some &pound;4 million. Does the Department of  Education have the authority to spend that amount? Will it be left with the  Department of Education, or will it be taken on by the entire Executive? Significant  problems will arise if that does not happen.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want a co-ordinated response to the economic crisis  facing us all; that is the real issue that needs to be tackled. It is right and  proper that we look at our figures, and I have done that. However, I think that  the long-term future of our society depends on our education system. I join  other Members in saying that we must find a way of increasing funding for  schools in the primary sector. All Members have agreed on that point.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Yet, as Mr Hamilton rightly pointed out in his introductory  remarks, if more is to be spent in a particular area, a decision has to be made  about which Department that money should be taken from. It is the Executive&rsquo;s  corporate and collective responsibility to sit down and work out &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am quite happy to take an intervention from Mr Storey if he wishes to make  one.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  When it comes to the Ulster Unionist Party, my mathematics is sometimes a wee  bit confused. Is the Member talking about a four-party mandatory coalition or  the two-party coalition that was referred to earlier? How does the Ulster  Unionist Party pick and choose when there is collective responsibility?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member will be given an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am glad that Mr Storey highlighted that point. I call it as I see it: there  is no four-party coalition; there is a two-party coalition in which the two  parties carve up whatever it is that they want to do. I can speak only for our  party, but we are prepared to be responsible and to work collectively with the  Member&rsquo;s party in order to tackle the problems facing all the people of Northern Ireland.  We need to find a way out of this mess, and party-political bickering is not  the way to proceed. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That response merely exemplifies my point; those Members  are not listening carefully to what I have to say. The Chairperson of the  Committee for Education should know about the pressures that exist, and he will  assess them and be as concerned as I am about whether we will be able to balance  the budget. I do not think that we will be able to do that. I am not pointing  the finger of blame at anyone, because we find ourselves in a dire situation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I bring these matters to the attention of the Minister of  Finance and Personnel with due respect and humility, and I ask whether we can  we find some way of working through the problems collectively. As I have said  in the past, we will work with him, but we need to take corporate and  collective responsibility. That is not an unreasonable position to take.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr Storey)</strong>: In order to ensure that the  Deputy Speaker does not reprimand me for things that I may say later, I will  make the point that I will make only the first part of my speech in my capacity  as the Chairperson of the Committee for Education.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will inform the House of the position that the Department  of Education registered in the stocktake exercise. A total of &pound;60 million of  resource pressures were identified for 2009-2010, and some &pound;50 million of resource  pressures were identified for 2010-11. The Department also registered a capital  bid of &pound;90 million for the schools capital programme for 2010-11.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In late November 2008, the Committee received a briefing  from senior departmental officials that detailed those pressures, and we  questioned officials again at last week&rsquo;s Committee meeting.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The details of the bids have been posted on the Committee&rsquo;s  website should Members wish to consider and examine the make-up of those  significant budget pressures.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As Basil McCrea said, key resource pressures arise from the  cost of job evaluations, pay reviews, teacher pensions and redundancy costs,  and rises in energy and utility costs, which are all classified as inescapable  pressures. A bid to address a shortfall in the extended schools programme is  also included. The Committee is concerned that such pressures need to be met  but recognises the need to explore fully the scope to reprioritise spending  within the &pound;2 billion education budget.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will outline an example of an initiative that is under  way, for which the Committee pressed the Department during the second half of  2008. It should bring &pound;27 million into mainstream funding to support primary  schools from April 2009. Funding support for the new curriculum under the  Making a Good Start scheme and foundation-stage funding together with funding  for primary-teaching principals&rsquo; release time should be fully delegated to  primary schools under the common funding formula allocations rather than being  earmarked budgets. That will allow primary-school principals and boards of  governors to use their funds more flexibly in line with their needs and  priorities and will reduce the Department&rsquo;s administration costs.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department and the Minister must proactively explore  such initiatives and innovations on the use of finite education resources. The  Committee for Education will continue to scrutinise the education budget  through its processes and through the system that the Committee has established  and will press for ways to use education funds more effectively and  efficiently.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was alarmed to find a &pound;90 million shortfall &mdash;  or long fall, depending on how one interprets it &mdash; in the capital budget for  2010-11, which, apparently, goes back to the Budget settlement of 2007. The  Committee was told that some projects, particularly PPP projects, will have to  be slowed down or halted. We will question officials on the implications of  that matter at next week&rsquo;s Committee meeting.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will now speak as a Member of the House rather than as  Chairperson of the Committee for Education, and I would be interested to hear  the Minister&rsquo;s comments on whether it is not regrettable that the three  Departments that did not identify, reprioritise or assist in releasing  additional resources during the exercise that we have undertaken in recent  weeks and months were the Department of Education, the Department for Regional  Development and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development? It is  worth noting that the Ministers of those three Departments are members of the  same party.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  The Minister of Education claims to be the champion of the socially  disadvantaged. Does the Member agree that her handling of the budget for the  extended schools programme will result in a &pound;6&middot;4 million shortfall in that  budget this year, and that that will lead to a significant loss of momentum in  that programme and occasion a stop-go approach that will not serve the socially  disadvantaged very well?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  The Member has identified another problem with how the Department and the  Minister address those particular needs. Everyone talks about priorities and  the importance of placing children &mdash; in an education context &mdash; at the centre of  all that we do. However, the Department&rsquo;s priorities do not always reflect that  notion. The Committee has accepted &mdash; and, as a Member, I accept it, too &mdash; that  there are inescapable pressures. However, if we are unable to prioritise a &pound;2  billion budget in order to deliver for extended schools and all the needs of  our education system, then that surely questions the Minister&rsquo;s ability, on  that issue and on many others, to do the job that she was elected to do?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: As  a member of the Committee for Finance and Personnel, I welcome today&rsquo;s debate.  Although a lot of what has been heard today has been heard before, some novel  remarks have been made. I was particularly taken by Stephen Farry&rsquo;s acknowledge&shy;ment  that the decision on the deferral of water rates may even have been the right  decision. At the very least that is progress on behalf of the Alliance Party.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the debate because I think that a strategic  stocktake is the way forward. Unlike the amateur astronomers in the Assembly  and the media, who seem to be finding black holes around every corner, I think  that, although the finances are very tight, they have been soundly handled by  the Finance Minister. There are undoubtedly issues in the Departments over how  that has been handled, as has been indicated on a number of occasions, and  those are under ongoing examination by the various departmental Committees.  However, given the tight financial circumstances, it is right that we should  have a sharp, focused debate. That is why a strategic stocktake is the right  way forward.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There have been proposals from Mr McNarry, Mr Maginness and  others, who have spoken of the legal advice and the inappropriate nature of the  process. I have a twofold reply. First, in regard to the issue of legal advice,  for all that that has been brought up, there has not been any attempt at a  legal challenge to the process, and that is because the process is utterly  robust in that respect, and any legal challenges would be without foundation.  Secondly, on the fundamental issue as to whether there should be a stocktake or  a Budget process, there is an element of navel-gazing with some in the  Assembly, which focuses &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  will in a moment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That navel-gazing focuses on process above delivery and  examination of the best way forward.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Although I am broadly supportive of what the Member says, there are certain  technical problems with the process. In relation to education, we rely upon  in-year monitoring to fund extended schools, but the education and library  boards need to make decisions now. There must be some way of providing reassurance  that we can protect vulnerable programmes; there must be a way of dealing with  that.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: We  should always be looking at how we protect vulnerable programmes. The point I  am making is that, from a process point of view, there are better ways in which  the money available to the Department of Education could have been spent. The  point is that if we are hung up on the process, and the issue of whether there  is a Budget or a strategic stocktake, we miss the real point.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the remarks made by Mr McNarry, I was  slightly perplexed &mdash; not for the first time &mdash; by the Ulster Unionists. When the  Minister made a statement last week, it seemed that some were welcoming the  direction to be taken, and yet Mr McNarry now says that we are on the wrong  track. The somewhat schizophrenic attitude of the Ulster Unionists is perhaps  not surprising, given the fact that Mr McNarry&rsquo;s attitude seems to be &ldquo;spend, spend,  spend&rdquo;, whereas the attitude of his Conservative overlords is &ldquo;cut, cut, cut&rdquo;.  We have to see where the balance lies.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan reflected the general obsession of the SDLP with  social housing as a means to solve all ills in our society, but when pressed,  could offer no solution as to where the money should come for that.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Yes, briefly.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Regardless of the SDLP&rsquo;s view of social  housing, will the Member comment on the Construction Employers Federation&rsquo;s  grave concern about investment in social housing and other infrastructure?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  Executive have committed to hundreds of millions of pounds worth of  construction, which goes beyond social housing. That includes record amounts on  hospitals, schools and roads. There is therefore a strong commitment, and I am  sure that the Minister will deal with that in more detail. The Member&rsquo;s party  has this narrow obsession with social housing. There would be more sympathy for  the Minister for Social Development were it not for the fact that, in the most  recent monitoring round, her Department was allocated an additional &pound;20  million, yet on a number of occasions she has been unable to spend her budget  in the first place.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan said that the Finance Minister was no Shackleton.  I am a great admirer of Ernest Shackleton &mdash; not least because of the fact that  he stood as a unionist candidate in Scotland in the early 1900s.  Despite his many qualities, however, he failed in his objective to reach the  South Pole on his first expedition; his ship sank on his second expedition; and  he died before his third expedition began its work. We should not emulate that  example.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I consider our Minister to be much more like Roald Amundsen  &mdash; professionally dealing with a range of challenging circumstances, and  overcoming those odds and delivering. The strategic stocktake is an important  and worthwhile exercise for the Executive. There has been change, and there is  a commitment to capital investment. I commend the work that has been done, and  I welcome today&rsquo;s debate.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: A key  priority for the Department for Social Development is building social housing  to solve the serious problem of housing shortage. There is no doubt that we  have a huge housing need &mdash; nearly 40,000 people are on the housing waiting  list. The Housing Executive faces a dire shortfall in its building programme in  this financial year. The target of building 1,500 new homes is unlikely to be  met; the Housing Executive proposes to build only 400 new homes at the start of  the next financial year &mdash; April 2009.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Approximately one third of the Housing Executive&rsquo;s spend is  dependent on revenue from house and land sales &mdash; a system that is bound to be  affected by economic fluctuations, of which we have very clearly seen evidence.  The 2007 budget allocation was based on significant receipts from house and  land sales for the Housing Executive programmes and for newbuilds. The forecast  level of receipts was based on the trend of pervious years during the economic  and housing boom. They were, therefore, agreed before the recent downturn in  property values and the credit crunch.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is now projected that house and land sales that are  required to fund Housing Executive programmes will drop by &pound;60 million in  2009-2010 and &pound;50 million in 2010-11. In addition, as a result of the economic  downturn, there will be a shortfall of &pound;55 million in 2009-2010 and &pound;35 million  in 2010-11 from land sales, housing association borrowing and contributions  from developers that are earmarked for the newbuild programme.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the &pound;31 million that the Minister for Social  Development gave back during the December monitoring round would have went some  way towards addressing the problem that has just been outlined?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: It  would have helped, but a lot more is needed in order to meet the targets that  were set in the Programme for Government.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive endorsed the Department for Social  Development&rsquo;s housing agenda. They saw it as a priority for all our communities.  Housing is a big issue for all communities in Northern Ireland. The downturn in  the economic situation here should not penalise those communities by not giving  the Housing Executive the required allocation to build the necessary housing  units.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Does the Member accept that there are innovative ways in which to assist the  construction industry and other firms by allowing contracts that are already  agreed to commence immediately, and by allowing payments to be deferred until  the next financial year in order to safeguard employment and the stability of  firms that are currently looking for work?</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Given that we are running out of time, I remind Members that  interventions must be short.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>:  Absolutely; the construction industry is crying out for such measures, which  would ensure that people do not lose their jobs left, right and centre.  Therefore, I urge DFP to review its Budget allocation to the Department for  Social Development, taking account of the severe slump in land- and house-sale  receipts, so that the Department can meet its objective of providing decent  homes for all citizens.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr Dodds)</strong>: I welcome the opportunity to participate  in this debate on the strategic stocktake of the Executive&rsquo;s plans for the  financial years 2009-2010 and 2010-11, following my statement to the Assembly  last week.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although I would hope that my ministerial colleagues and I  already have a strong understanding of the issues and of the concerns of Northern  Ireland people, and I believe that we have demonstrated that understanding,  this debate is important because it provides the Executive with an opportunity  to hear the Assembly&rsquo;s opinion about the public-expenditure position for the  next two years. However, it is equally important that that is a two-way process  and that Members now have a better understanding of the constraints facing  Ministers. Moreover, I hope that they will take that into account when carrying  out the vital role of scrutinising the public-expenditure plans of Departments.</p>
        <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In that context, I wish to record my gratitude to the  Committee for Finance and Personnel for its contribution to the strategic  stocktake process, and, in particular, to the Chairperson of the Committee for  tabling the take-note motion.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, I am grateful for most Members&rsquo; comments about  the strategic stocktake, and I shall attempt to respond to as many as possible  of the points that they raised. In doing so, I shall focus on several matters  that were raised after my statement, and which some Members raised again today.  Those matters relate to the desire &mdash; as Members put it &mdash; for a more fundamental  review of the Executive&rsquo;s spending priorities, as well as the misunderstanding,  and in some cases, the deliberate misunderstanding, that has arisen about the  scale of the issues raised by Departments in their strategic-stocktake returns.  However, I am glad that the fact is finally getting through to some Members  that a strategic stocktake is precisely that &mdash; a stocktake of strategic issues,  and not an in-year monitoring process. Therefore, I am grateful that, slowly  but surely, some Members are beginning to catch on to what is happening.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am, I suppose, caught between the argument, on the one  hand, that the Executive are spending too much and, on the other, that too  little has been allocated to Departments. Sometimes, one is tempted to say that  perhaps one has got it just about right.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I shall begin with the review of spending allocations. No  one could disagree &mdash; and Ian Paisley Jnr, in particular, emphasised the point &mdash;  that circumstances have changed significantly since the Budget was agreed and  that several Departments have been particularly affected by the downturn in the  local property market.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the points raised concerning the Department  for Social Development, we all recognise the importance of social housing to  the people of Northern    Ireland, as David Hilditch highlighted in  his remarks a Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development. That  recognition is reflected in the investment strategy for Northern Ireland  allocations for the next three years: &pound;612 million is allocated for roads; &pound;647  million is allocated to developing water infrastructure; &pound;565 million will go  to primary healthcare and hospital modernisation; and &pound;855 million will go to  schools and colleges.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that every Member will agree that those are  substantial sums. For housing, however, the allocation is &pound;925 million, and that  is, I believe, testimony to the massive investment and priority that the  Executive put on social housing in Northern Ireland, and anyone who  says otherwise is simply not in command of the facts. However, that would come  as no surprise to most of us who regularly follow these debates.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The proposal from the local commentator John Simpson for  the Executive to increase their response to the economic downturn by up to &pound;100  million was mentioned, and I have carefully considered that. Obviously, that is  an important matter, and I have the utmost respect for commentators. However, I  feel that different conclusions would have been reached had people been fully  aware of all the factors that lie behind the approach agreed by the Executive  in the strategic stocktake.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Reference has been made to the &pound;50 million to &pound;100 million  reallocation. I said it last week, and I repeat it today: if we are to have a  fundamental review of the departmental allocations, and if Members want more  money for a particular service or Department, they will have to state from  which existing service the money should be taken. To be fair to Basil McCrea,  he acknowledged as much in advance of making a plea for the Department of  Education. I also heard a plea from Mr McGlone in relation to the Department of  the Environment. Pleas were also made for the Department for Employment and  Learning, and even more were made for the Department for Social Development.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We did not hear anything for the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety. Basil McCrea talked about the collective  nature of the Assembly. Almost half of the total expenditure has been allocated  to the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. If we are going  to reallocate resources, a primary source of those reallocated moneys would  have to come out of the big-spending Departments, such as the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the Department of Education.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">When Members are making challenges, they say that these are  matters for the Executive to resolve or that somebody else should come up with  a solution. They never say that what they are actually advocating are cuts to,  primarily, health and education services. Let them be honest and admit from  where the money will come.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Later, I will talk about the work that is being done in  those vital areas, but Members must remember that capital spending in those  Departments is helping the construction industry. To cut money from the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the Department of  Education would be to attack the construction industry as well as cutting  health and education services.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members need to be realistic in this debate and use some  common sense. They must not adopt the immature position that, somehow, there is  extra money out there. The money has to come from somewhere. The entire Budget  has been allocated over a three-year period and with the Programme for  Government, has been agreed unanimously in the Executive. There are no extra  resources coming from Westminster;  in fact, if anything, the Labour Party and the Conservative Party are vying  with each other to see who can make the greatest cuts. I heard what Mr McNarry  said in the debate, but, unfortunately, he is absent from the Chamber and will  not hear my response to his contribution. He did not mention that his new party  masters in the Conservative Party would, if they were in power, implement  massive cuts in public expenditure in Northern   Ireland and across Whitehall  from April this year. Even greater cuts are planned by the Labour Party for  2010-11.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Let us have some realism in the debate. To blame everyone  else and to refuse to take responsibility &mdash; as Mr McNarry does with regard to  his Conservative colleagues and masters&rsquo; approach to public expenditure &mdash; is  the height of irresponsibility. There is no doubt, however, that that issue  will come back to haunt him and others.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to increasing the scale of the investment  programme, I remind Members that the downturn in capital receipts has impacted  on the whole Executive. However, we have to deliver on our ambitious plans. I  mentioned the importance of the investment programme. We hear talk about  intervening to help the construction industry &mdash; currently, there are seven  major projects under construction in the Health Service. Back in December, we  announced that &pound;400 million worth of projects would come to the market before  the end of the financial year, and that &pound;115 million would be taken out of the  frameworks to be allowed to be procured project by project &mdash; so ensuring that  none of them would be stopped. We also ensured that the work of the Planning  Service was being done more quickly as a result of performance and efficiency  delivery unit working with the Department of the Environment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are plans for investment of &pound;1&middot;4 billion to &pound;1&middot;5  billion for this year, and that will rise to &pound;1&middot;7 billion next year and &pound;2  billion the following year. That is &pound;265 million in the Health Service towards  the building of important health facilities at the Royal  Victoria Hospital,  the Ulster Hospital,  Downe Hospital,  Altnagelvin Hospital and in Portadown. From which of  those areas in the Health Service &mdash; and the associated construction work &mdash; do  the Members who propose that money be taken from one area and reallocated think  that that money should be taken.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Let them tell us which of those health or road projects  should be cut. Members talk about social housing being the only means of  stimulating construction, but I had a meeting with the quarry producers the  other day, and they identified road maintenance and development as the way  forward.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A point was raised about referring to the opinions of expert  commentators. The CBI&rsquo;s submission in October 2008 mentioned social housing,  but also raised a host of other ways to stimulate the construction industry.  All those issues are important, but they are all competing demands. Members who  made critical statements during the debate failed to suggest any solutions,  other than wish lists based on the economics of fantasy rather than reality.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members should look at what has been achieved: &pound;127 million  has been invested in the Belfast sewers project; &pound;89 million in waste-water  treatment projects; &pound;83 million in four major projects in the Department for  Employment and Learning, and &pound;200 million in 14 projects being constructed by  the education and library boards. Which of those projects should be halted? If  the issue is to be addressed seriously, those questions must be answered.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Reference was made to a so-called black hole in the  economy. Not long ago, the Assembly was being told about a &pound;500 million black  hole in this year&rsquo;s Budget. That has now disappeared and is no longer  mentioned, because it was subsequently seen to be completely wrong.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry is not present to hear my response to his simply  incredible allegations. The basic thrust of his argument was that it is  fundamentally wrong to rely on in-year monitoring and overcommitments. He  argued that taking such an approach is dangerous; other Members, although they  were not explicit, hinted at that, too. However, on 15 December 2008, his  colleague Mr Beggs, during the debate on the monitoring statement, said about  me:</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;that in extending belatedly the amount of overcommitment, he  is reversing the decision of his predecessor and that he will be implementing  one of the ideas that was suggested by the Ulster Unionist Party in its  submission on the draft Budget&rdquo;. &mdash; <em>[Official Report, Vol 36, No 3, p115, col  2].</em></p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Mr McNarry is now criticising what his party  colleague, on 15 December, praised as being part of the UUP&rsquo;s submission on the  Budget.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Another idea that has disappeared down the black hole of Mr  McNarry&rsquo;s imagination is the proposal that he made before Christmas for an  equity release scheme. Members will recall that he produced, with a great  fanfare, his idea that the Treasury would somehow give the Assembly an  interest-free loan on the basis of valuing all its assets, and when prices  subsequently rose, the Assembly could sell all its assets and pocket the  difference. That proposal does not feature at all now; it was just another of  Mr McNarry&rsquo;s typical crackpot schemes that he thinks up on the back of an  envelope; none of them address the issues.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is our sensible, logical and rational approach that is  delivering the way forward. It seems that Mr McNarry has never heard of  pressures; he needs to take a crash course in economics. The logic of his  proposal to meet in-year pressures and reduced requirements, and the  alternative to in-year monitoring, is to tell Departments that DFP will slice  off 2%, 3% or 10% from their capital budgets and transfer the money into a  central fund. To ensure that every single demand for money would be met, DFP  would then sit on that money until the Departments needed it. The inevitable  outcome would be that, at the end of the year, DFP would have tens or hundreds  of millions of pounds that were unspent, and it would have to give that money  back to the Treasury.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The reason why we adopt the approach that we do, which has  been tried and tested over the years, is because it means that Departments can  continue to spend money, but, if in-year pressures emerge at the centre, any  money that does not need to, or cannot, be spent, can be reallocated. If  Members are saying that they want a fundamental review of the Budget, they must  agree to put all the money on the table. As the amounts spent on education and  health are by far the largest, that would, effectively, mean removing money  from those two areas and reallocating it.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We heard today that, when that starts to happen, not only  will the Department for Social Development be in there but so will Mr Basil  McCrea and others on behalf of the Department of Education. The Department for  Employment and Learning and, no doubt, the Minister of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety will also have something to say. Mr McCrea said that a  collective decision is needed. I would very much like to hear what the Minister  of Health would have to say about any suggestion that his budget be cut. I  would be interested to hear either the Minister for Social Development or the  Minister of Education suggest that something in their budgets could be cut.  However, I do not hear that suggestion from any Minister. All I hear is that  budgets cannot be cut. Therefore, let us have a degree of realism.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As far as the investment strategy is concerned, the  Executive have announced capital projects and investments throughout Northern Ireland  &mdash; for schools, healthcare, hospitals, housing and the environment. We are  spending 40% more than was spent in 2007-08. We are spending &pound;1&middot;4 billion to  &pound;1&middot;5 billion this year. Under direct rule in 2003-04, that figure was &pound;670  million. The Executive have been asked about what they are doing for the  construction industry. We are already pumping in far more capital investment,  which will help the construction industry, than was ever done under direct  rule, and we are planning to do even more next year, when the value of capital  expenditure will rise 6% or 7%. There will be even greater rises in the following  year. Members must recognise all of that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If I have time, I will deal with several other issues.  Jennifer McCann raised the issues of fiscal powers in Northern Ireland  and our receiving the block grant from the UK Treasury. It must be recognised  that Northern Ireland  benefits significantly from being under the UK public-expenditure system. That  is ever more illustrated when one looks at what is happening in the Irish Republic.  I did not hear much reference in the debate to the glowing example of the Celtic  tiger economy down South. If we were in the same position as the Irish Republic,  we would have to make massive cuts to existing spending programmes. However,  not one Member from the SDLP, or from Sinn F&eacute;in for that matter, cited the  wonderful example of what the Irish   Republic is doing with  its economy. Significantly, not a single reference has been made to the Irish Republic  or its handling of the economy, and that speaks volumes for our being under the  UK  public-expenditure system.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We heard the issue of annual Budgets raised again and  again. When those Members talk to their ministerial colleagues, they will tell  them that they want certainty on funding and more effective management of  public services &mdash; at least that is what they tell us. That is reflected in the  general UK  approach to a three-year spending review. Northern Ireland is not unique in  that respect.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">One or two Members picked up on the more important emerging  pressures, such as efficiencies that the Chancellor suggested in the pre-Budget  report. It is important to note that in my recent discussions with the Scottish  and Welsh Finance Ministers, we picked up on that issue, and there is much  common ground on how we address that issue and other issues. I was struck by  the large degree of commonality in our approach.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, I, and, I hope, all Executive colleagues,  recognise that we must continue to bear down strongly on the difficulties in  the economy, and we must continue to help local businesses, local households,  people and families at this difficult time. That is why we included support for  families and businesses over the next three years, and that is why we decided  to freeze domestic regional rates over the Budget period, marking a clear break  from direct rule, when rates bills increased, on average, by around 10%. That  is why we have taken measures to bring rate relief to senior citizens and  vulnerable households, such as the lone pensioner allowance, the right to defer  rate payments and the reduction in maximum capital values.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is why we recently announced a package of &pound;8 million  over the next year to help local councils make up a deficit caused by a  shortfall in rates revenue. It is why we have also taken measures to defer  water charges for a further year. It is why I negotiated a &pound;900 million  financial package with the Prime Minister to meet the pressures of water  charges, among other issues. It is why, just last December, we allocated extra  money &mdash; &pound;20 milllion &mdash; for social housing, and &pound;10 million for health and  social care services, as well as for a range of other issues as well. It is why  we addressed issues to help the construction industry, the Department of  Agriculture, the Department for Regional Development and the Department of  Education. It is why we took the decision to bring in a small-business  rates-relief scheme and to freeze business rates in real terms. It is why the  Executive decided not to proceed with the direct rule policy of introducing  industrial rating at the level on which the direct rule Administration had decided.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Therefore, we will continue to work hard to deliver  for businesses, households and hard-working families in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McLaughlin)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank Members for their contributions and the  Minister for setting out the context of, and the rationale behind, the  strategic stocktake. The debate has generally been constructive and useful.  Some 18 Members contributed, and they raised a number of issues. Members will  be relieved to hear that I do not intend to give a blow-by-blow rehearsal of  each contribution. However, like the Minister, I shall reflect on some of the  key themes that emerged in the debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We heard different views from Members on the merits of the  approach taken to the stocktake, and, in particular, on whether a new formal  Budget process should be embarked on. On the one hand, the argument has been  made that the changed economic climate warrants a reopening of the existing  departmental allocations through the period up to 2011, with a formal process  to realign and reprioritise resources to meet current pressures. The  counter-argument is that given that there is no prospect at all of significant  additional resources, the present focus should be on the delivery of the  Executive&rsquo;s priorities, and on ensuring maximum impact from the finite  resources that are available, with reallocations taking place through the  in-year monitoring process. That view was underlined by the fact that no member  of the Executive came forward to surrender elements of his or her budget. The  Minister reiterated that point very powerfully. There was no identification of  where resources could be taken from one budget to strengthen or develop  another. That all means that we must deal with the resources that are  available, through a collective approach by the Assembly and the Executive.  That point was developed in discussions that my Committee had with senior  officers of the Department of Finance and Personnel last week.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Opening the debate, the Deputy Chairperson explained that  the Committee gave careful consideration to the implications of the Executive&rsquo;s  decision that the strategic stocktake would be undertaken in the context of the  three-year budgetary process. That included a consideration as to whether the  Committee should explore the legal position in that respect. The Committee  eventually decided against that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s debate and last week&rsquo;s ministerial statement  represent part of the outcome from the Committee&rsquo;s deliberations on the matter  and the representations that we made to the Minister, to which I believe he has  responded. Those discussions were scheduled for the purpose of providing  Assembly input into the overall strategic stocktake process. A further outcome  was the co-ordinated submission to the stocktake, which the Committee compiled  on behalf of the Statutory Committees.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At this point, it would, I believe, be useful to refer  briefly, as did the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee, to the terms of  reference from the stocktake. They include a review of departmental progress  against agreed plans; the identification of reduced requirements and emerging  pressures for the next two years; and proposals for addressing pressures  through adjustments to existing plans and priorities.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to put on record that the Committee and  departmental officials were very concerned that it would appear that some  Departments, in their responses, had ignored or not fully addressed those terms  of reference. The level of professionalism and competency is an ongoing concern  for my Committee with regard to underspend, financial projections and project  management, and that is an urgent requirement for departmental budgets.  Whatever about economic downturns, there were already pressures for  Departments. However, if we do not use the most efficient and effective  delivery mechanisms, and measure progress throughout the year, we end up with the  nonsense of end-of-year underspend and the surrender of money to the Treasury  and to the end-of-year stocks &mdash; and, of course, we now face significant  difficulties in accessing those stocks.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members mentioned the plight of the local  construction sector. In his response, the Minister set out in detail the action  being taken. The Committee considered the measures that have already been  agreed at Executive level as well as other possibilities. As Members know, the  Executive have already taken steps to speed up the payment of invoices, thereby  helping with cash flow for small and medium-sized enterprises.  Public-procurement policy and practice can be re-examined to maximise the  opportunity for local businesses. I raised that matter with the Minister at Question  Time yesterday, and the Committee is engaged on an inquiry on that issue, which  will hear the views of small and medium-sized enterprises and social  enterprises.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of greater flexibility has also been discussed  with the Committee with regard to the interpretation or application of  procedures in order to cut out unnecessary bureaucracy. As the Minister said,  my Committee raised that issue with him with regard to the recent proposal from  the Quarry Products Association. That proposal concerned bringing forward  roads-maintenance schemes immediately in order to maintain and sustain work  crews and workforces, and an agreement by association members to defer submitting  invoices for work carried out until the incoming financial year. Although I am  mindful of the importance of the accounting rules, the Department should look  for flexibility &mdash; if necessary, by the Minister raising the issue through  urgent direct negotiations with the Treasury &mdash; so that the Executive can  respond positively to such proposals in the context of the exceptionally  difficult economic circumstances.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I also hope that DFP opens up negotiations with the  Treasury to enable the Executive further to increase capital spending to boost  the building industry. The Committee has been told how Treasury rules prevent  the Executive from bringing forward capital spend from one year to the next,  despite a three-year CSR settlement being in place. However, it was mentioned  in the debate that the Scottish Government have brought forward &pound;230 million of  capital projects into 2009-2010, which demonstrates flexibility being explored  to the optimum. There is also a question as to whether additional borrowing  powers can be accessed in these circumstances, on which a collective judgement  would be helpful.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In short, these are exceptional economic circumstances,  which require exceptional responses, and I hope that the Minister proactively  pursues all available options further to support our local construction  industry.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members addressed the issue of competing budgetary  demands and the funding gaps caused by what can be best described as the  aspirational bids that were made by some Departments and Ministers.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister dealt quite powerfully with the question of  what can be done, as opposed to marking out in an aspirational way what the  Departments would like to do. There is the issue of capacity and of finite  resource. It has been pointed out that, for many years, Departments have had a  track record of putting forward unrealistic bids without identifying how they  will be met from within existing departmental allocations. Indeed, they may not  have any real expectation of them being met in the final analysis. DFP officials,  in their evidence to the Committee, agreed with that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members have made cases for priority in individual  departmental portfolios. That is inevitable, even in the tenor of this  afternoon&rsquo;s discussion. It is obvious that competing or partisan positions  would inevitably be presented. However, we heard arguments for additional  resourcing for social housing, enhanced skilling and retraining, healthcare,  schools capital projects, the construction sector and waste management.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Leaving aside the partisan element, those are priorities  for the Assembly and the Executive, and the real issue is how the competing  demands can be prioritised and funded. We should all recognise that the present  funding arrangements under the Barnett formula &mdash; coupled with very limited  powers available to raise revenue, except from rates &mdash; means that there is a  limited pot of money to go around, and constraints exist on the Executive&rsquo;s  ability to generate additional or new finances.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The allocations received under the Barnett formula do not  take account of our local needs. All parties have made that point from time to  time, and, in fairness, Ministers have also made it. Therefore, we have to  divide the cake as equitably as possible, and we have to take account of  existing pressures. Hence, there is a need to prioritise our spend, to  continually raise the performance of the public sector, and to maximise the  impact on the value for money to be achieved from the available resources.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister pointed out that overall the level of resources  available over the next two years is expected to reduce, rather than increase,  as a consequence. However, Departments and Ministers are making bids for  significant and unrealistic sums of additional spend, which raises the question  of whether people have grasped the value of having carefully thought out and  costed Budget proposals in the first instance, and, secondly, in terms of the  strategic stocktake, taken account of changing circumstances, economically and  otherwise.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The role of Committees and the wider Assembly in actively  scrutinising in-year departmental expenditure, including efficiency delivery  plans and investment delivery plans, continues to take on more significance  every day in the current climate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We should be mindful that Departments have considerable  scope to reallocate resources within their existing baselines to meet new and  emerging pressures. Again, Committees have an emerging role &mdash; which was there  all along, but it is now coming sharply into focus &mdash; to ensure that Departments  are actively pursuing it. Committees are proactively examining the Departments&rsquo;  activity in that regard and setting out the priorities for the Departments,  which, in effect, represent a mature and considered response to existing  circumstances.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that many pressures declared by Departments for  2009 must be dealt with in subsequent monitoring rounds provides the  opportunity for the Executive to consider the importance of the monitoring  round system. Some Members were critical, but I did not hear proposals about  how that could be improved. There are four such monitoring rounds in any  12-month period. It is possible that there might be a more focused approach if  there were fewer rounds, because some of the earlier rounds are, in fact, just  a numbers game.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is no realistic possibility of either definitive  patterns of underspend emerging that would be of assistance, or of any  Department giving up resources in the earlier part of a financial year. It  might be more productive if we were to reduce our expectations and ensure that  we have a much more transparent and accountable approach to the issue of the  monitoring round process. In the current circumstances that might take on even  more significance, given that the global economic downturn will continue to  affect us for the next few years.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The severity of the economic downturn surprised many  economists and commentators, including, with all due respect, John Simpson.  That means that the Executive are now faced with the challenge of achieving  targets in an environment that is markedly different from that which existed  when the Programme for Government and the investment strategy were agreed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I take some reassurance from what the Minister said today  and what senior departmental officials are telling us about the strategic  investment programme. Completing that programme will be a difficult, but not  impossible, task. Those Members who take the approach that a huge black hole is  opening up are, perhaps, not fully exploring the substantial power over  expenditure that is available to the Committee for Finance and Personnel.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must draw his remarks to a close.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Given the restricted Budget, let us work together, support each other and allow  all Departments to produce a spending programme that will sustain our local  economy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly takes note of the Executive&rsquo;s budget  position for 2009/10 and 2010/11, in the context of the strategic stocktake as  conveyed by the Minister of Finance and Personnel in the statement on 20  January 2009.</p>
        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="6"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
        <p class="H4StageHeading">Shared Future</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes to propose the motion  and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members will have five  minutes. One amendment has been selected and published on the Marshalled List.  The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes to propose and five minutes  to make a winding-up speech.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly states its concern at the failure of the  Office of the First and deputy First Minister to meet its own deadlines for the  publication of a draft strategy for Cohesion, Sharing and Integration,  incorporating the Racial Equality Strategy; expresses its concern at the  marginalisation of the existing Shared Future Framework and Action Plan and the  resultant absence of a clear policy on community relations; and demands that  the Department urgently brings forward detailed proposals for addressing the  continued problems and consequences arising from division and segregation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I shall begin by declaring an interest as a member of the  Community Relations Council (CRC). My colleagues and I are happy to accept the  SDLP amendment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The motion encapsulates the frustration that is growing in  many quarters of the House &mdash; though not as many as I would like, given the  attendance of some parties in particular &mdash; and in wider society, about the  absence of a credible policy for community relations, good relations or a  shared future, call it what one will, in Northern Ireland. That absence is  growing and is becoming embarrassing. The Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister has given us a litany of promises about when we can  expect a draft strategy to be published for consultation, never mind a  finalised policy document. Those promises keep falling, and the gap is  widening.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We can all speculate as to why that may be, and we can come  up with different theories, such as the differences between the parties that  occupy the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, or, indeed,  major issues of substance. It is to be hoped that the reasons for the delay can  be properly elaborated on by Members as the debate continues.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In some respects, CSI (cohesion, sharing and integration)  may be an appropriate acronym for the draft strategy, because the way things  are going, we might need a crime scene investigator to find it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Was that a joke?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: If  the Member wants to laugh, he can.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The question of whether we should have a policy for  community relations in Northern    Ireland is something that we must face up  to.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">This is not a luxury that we can choose to have; it is not  an optional extra. It should be central to any consideration of the future in Northern Ireland.  The Executive talk of prioritising the economy, and there are many questions as  to whether their actions match their rhetoric. We will judge them on that  commitment. However, one cannot grow the economy in Northern Ireland without  considering a shared future. Similarly, it is difficult to build and  consolidate a shared future unless you have a growing and prosperous society.  Those two aspects of policy go hand in hand; that is the incentive for the  Executive to get on and produce something.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">This delay is not new to devolved government; it is a  paradox of Northern Ireland  community relations policy that most progress has occurred under direct rule.  That is something of which the Assembly should be ashamed. Ultimately, we have  responsibility for the nature of our society and should not rely upon a  Government accountable to people outside Northern Ireland to produce solid  policy consequences. We must face up to that reality. A Shared Future stalled  under the first mandate of the Assembly; only when suspension occurred in 2002  did action and documents follow. With the restoration of devolution, a Shared  Future and the action plan were sidelined by the incoming Executive, which  promised to produce their own policy, which they have called cohesion, sharing  and integration.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have no difficulty whatsoever with a local devolved  Administration, particularly when different parties come in, taking on lead  responsibility and producing their own alternative strategy in which they have  a greater sense of ownership. That is their prerogative, and we respect it.  However, we cannot respect a failure to produce. A Shared Future was a good  strategy, though it may not have been perfect. If the Executive want to try to  improve upon it, we will welcome anything along those lines that they produce &mdash;  but, yet again, there is a vacuum.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The rationale for having a policy on community relations or  good relations is perfectly clear. Continued divisions in our society, the  problems of sectarianism and other forms of prejudice, and the ingrained  patterns of segregation all carry major costs that we have to bear. They affect  us all. None of us can isolate ourselves from those problems. There are major  financial implications, but I will not go back over that territory. There are  also major economic considerations.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Divisions cause problems for labour market mobility, deter  inward investment and affect where investment goes in Northern Ireland  once we manage to attract it. We need to face up to those problems. Segregation  has major human and social implications; one has only to look at the area of  education, where there is not only a cost, but an opportunity cost which arises  when children of different backgrounds are denied the opportunity to mix with  one another.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is no coincidence that the most deprived areas in  Northern Ireland that suffer most acutely from poverty are those that are most  segregated. When we talk of dealing with poverty in the Assembly, let us look  at segregation and the impact that it has.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, we cannot forget the environment. Divisions  impact upon the nature of our local environment. The Royal Institution of  Chartered Surveyors has proven that divisions lead to a heavier carbon footprint  in Northern Ireland.  If we are to tackle climate change, we must address the divisions and build a  shared future.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">From that analysis, it is clear that community relations  cuts across all aspects of government and cannot be placed in a small silo. Things  may be getting better; there are indications from across the board that people  from different backgrounds are more willing to mix, share and integrate from  one another. We are also becoming a much more diverse society, and that is  something that we should warmly welcome. The diversity that is coming to Northern Ireland  enriches us all, and we stand to benefit from it. A well-known academic Richard  Florida points out that cities and regions that are able to attract a diverse  population are better able to nurture creativity and, therefore, greater  prosperity. That should put in context the remarks made by one member of the  Executive over the weekend.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At the same time, we must realise that many people in Northern Ireland  are missing out on the opportunities that are available to others. There is a  real danger of a two-speed Northern Ireland emerging &mdash; one in which an  underclass is marginalised and lives in a ghettoised environment and,  consequently, misses out on opportunities. That situation is perhaps most acute  in our two main cities, Belfast  and Derry/Londonderry. However, it is also a problem in rural communities. A  very good report that was produced by Katy Radford, among others, illustrates  that situation extremely well.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Looking to the future, obviously we want the draft strategy  for cohesion, sharing and integration to be published as quickly as possible so  that consultation can get under way, because it will take some time for the  policy to be put in place.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, we are also concerned about what will be included  in the strategy. It is important that we do not slip backwards from &lsquo;A Shared  Future&rsquo;. That document was good in the sense that it recognised that &ldquo;separate  but equal&rdquo; was not a viable way forward and that benign apartheid is a fallacy.  It also recognised the importance of cross-cutting actions among Departments  and that community relations cannot be held in the silo of OFMDFM only. There  are fears, however, that the draft strategy might create a situation in which  we slip back to those ways and in which community relations goes back into the  silo of OFMDFM, because no real burden is placed on the other Departments.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">On one hand, more money will be made available in departmental  budgets for community relations; however, OFMDFM will have control over that.  Therefore, other Departments, such as the Department of Education, will not be  under pressure to introduce their own policy initiatives.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP&rsquo;s amendment focuses on the issue of housing. I pay  tribute to the work of DSD. At present, it is perhaps the only Department that  is moving matters forward and trying to build a shared future, particularly at  the housing level by taking forward shared-future housing initiatives and  examining the number of the urban regeneration programmes.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, a major problem exists with the way in which the  Housing Executive approaches mixed housing. That must be exposed and  challenged. The Housing Executive&rsquo;s policy is to allow people to choose whether  they live in a mixed area or a single-identity area. On the face of it, that  may seem perfectly benign to some people.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, the implications of that policy are not benign,  because single-identity areas will have to be maintained, thereby denying  people the ability to live where they wish. I do not believe that that is a  tolerable way forward. Certainly, if that policy were based on race, as opposed  to religion, it would be condemned internationally. Although I welcome the  amendment, the matter of mixed housing is one that the Minister for Social Development  and her Department must address.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: At end insert</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;; and further calls for these detailed proposals to  be fully budgeted and to recognise the potential of social and affordable  housing initiatives aimed at tackling sectarianism, promoting reconciliation  and advancing the creation of a shared and integrated society.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge the presence of junior Minister Kelly in the  Chamber this afternoon. It is much appreciated that at least one member of the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister is present for this debate.  Given junior Minister Donaldson&rsquo;s concurrence with the comments that Minister  Wilson made at the weekend, he, too, ought to be here to hear the content of  this debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">During an earlier debate, the Minister of Finance and  Personnel said robustly that no ideas were being suggested as to where cuts  could be made. If he were to examine the &lsquo;Cost of Division&rsquo; report &mdash; which was  published but subsequently binned by members of Sinn F&eacute;in at the Committee for  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister &mdash; he would find that  Northern Ireland, at its upper limit, spends an additional &pound;1&middot;5 billion per  annum on a per capita basis on its public services. That includes direct costs  and costs arising from duplication.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, it is incumbent upon all Ministers in the Executive  to examine the issues of sectarianism and how we might tackle the biggest  challenge that continues to face our society &mdash; racism &mdash; which has become an unfortunate  trend in Northern Ireland now that it is more diverse in nature. That cannot be  left unsaid.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is most regrettable that, since April 2008, Members, including  Mr Molloy, Mr Dallat, Dr Farry and me, as well as the Committee, have been told  that OFMDFM&rsquo;s programme for cohesion, sharing and integration will be with us  shortly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We were told that the strategy was at an advanced stage of  development and would be brought before the Committee, which junior Minister  Kelly said would happen before the Hallowe&rsquo;en recess. We are now at the end of  January 2009, and we still have not seen any detailed programme.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">One of the points that I want the junior Minister to respond  to is that what is now referred to as a programme was initially referred to as  a strategy. I would like reassurance that a programme is not a lesser commitment  than a strategy. I acknowledge that there is a clear pledge by OFMDFM to  achieve reconciliation and integration, no matter how it is presented. Although  action to tackle sectarianism remains the biggest challenge, action to tackle  racism is most welcome.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The motion tabled by the Alliance Party appears to accept  that a racial equality strategy should form part of a cohesion, sharing and  integration strategy. There are two good policy initiatives there, and there is  a danger that, in trying to put everything in the one pot, things will get lost  and confused. Although we accept that a cohesion, sharing and integration  strategy should tackle sectarianism and racism, we do not want to see the DUP  and Sinn F&eacute;in duck the challenge or their responsibilities for tackling sectarianism,  promoting reconciliation and building a better and shared society.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The sharing of power in Stormont cannot be the end of the  journey towards a reconciled society. If anything, the recent DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in  attempt at a carve up of power highlights that there is still some way to  travel. In its amendment, the SDLP remains committed to a shared future and the  promotion of reconciliation and good relations in our society. The amendment is  evidence of that, as was our motion of 6 October 2008, which called for the  immediate publication of the CSI strategy. The motion was accepted unanimously  at that time.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There has been, and continues to be, a lack of progress,  despite lip-service by the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in in October. As well as committing  to delivering detailed proposals in support of the creation of a shared future,  any such proposals must be clearly budgeted and money ring-fenced. I  acknowledge that additional funding was set aside at the outset of the  comprehensive spending review towards the shared future strategy. It is  noteworthy that in the monitoring rounds over the past year, money has been  returned unspent and reallocated to other Departments because there has not  been a robust action plan and the new programme has yet to be introduced.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In &lsquo;A Shared Future and Racial Equality: Good Relations  Indicators Baseline Report&rsquo;, published in 2006, one of the priority outcomes  for OFMDFM is:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Northern    Ireland is a place where people of all  backgrounds work, live, learn and play together.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">One wonders how hollow some of those words ring  today. However, the baseline report also stated:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;More than half of the population (55%) believe that  better relations will come about through more mixing.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Those people said that shared housing in particular  was one of the ways in which that could be done. The regeneration of the  Girdwood and Crumlin Road  prison sites offers huge potential to enable that to happen. Many of our people  desire and want to be a part of that as we move to a new, better and shared  future.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Such a commitment will require a budget, and I believe that  there are opportunities to ring-fence such spend. Clarity and commitment need  to be built in. Without them, there is a risk that any proposals to promote  cohesion, sharing and integration would not be fully and effectively  implemented.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that the SDLP fully supports measures  to encourage mixed housing; that is clear from Minister Ritchie&rsquo;s  prioritisation of housing as an important route to a shared future in Northern Ireland.  In Banbridge in my constituency such a pilot scheme was launched several months  ago and has been tremendous success. Fortunately, unlike the days when I grew  up, there is now a greater acceptance of mixing across the two main communities  in the North. That is to be encouraged. People who want to live together should  be enabled to do so.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Over the next three years, DSD plans to develop at least 30  shared-future housing neighbourhoods within existing Northern Ireland Housing  Executive estates. However, the recent smash-and-grab from DSD&rsquo;s budget is  clear evidence of how little importance other parties give to investing in a  shared future. Although Members might spout platitudes about a shared future,  the facts speak for themselves; money was taken out of DSD. Before Members say  that the Minister could not spend the money, let me explain: the Minister  sought that money, but was required to get Executive approval to reallocate it,  even within her own Department. She had ideas for doing that which would have  led to better outcomes for those most marginalised in society and would have  gone some way toward the creation of a better and shared future.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Across civic society there is some doubt as to how  inclusive and participative a democracy this Assembly seeks to be. I note that  the DUP has tabled a motion calling for the removal of the Civic Forum. The  Civic Forum was always viewed as a vehicle to take forward the debate on a  shared future. It is a body that can work without the silos of Government  Departments and can add real value and fresh perspectives to the challenges  facing Northern Ireland  as a post-conflict society dealing with issues such as sectarianism, inward  migration and interfaces.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier today, at a meeting of the all-party Assembly group  on ethnic minority communities, some members expressed concern about the Civic  Forum. They had put a lot of work into developing proposals and hoped that  their voices would be heard. Representatives from ethnic minorities were very  concerned about the comments, which, over the weekend, emanated from  representatives of OFMDFM and the Executive. Perhaps junior Minister Kelly will  have an opportunity to refer to those comments. If not, I look forward to  junior Minster Donaldson&rsquo;s comments later today. There must be leadership and  outright condemnation of such remarks.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We all know, only too well, the causes of the conflict in  our society over the past 40 years. If we do not stand up for the Poles and  Lithuanians, for equal opportunities for all and for a fair and diverse  society, today&rsquo;s Pole could be tomorrow&rsquo;s Catholic.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  There is an old proverb, which illustrates that, at times, we are so caught up  in the individual threads that we cannot see the piece that is being  embroidered. The Alliance Party wishes to see a better Northern Ireland,  and I am with it on that. That is my goal, and the goal of a lot of the parties  in the Chamber. I understand the Alliance Party&rsquo;s reason for pushing the issue.  However, as a member of the OFMDFM Committee, I am in a position to see the  individual threads and how they contribute to the end product that we desire.  We are aiming for cohesion, sharing and integration &mdash; CSI. Probably all Members  are aware that I am a &lsquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&rsquo; fanatic; I watch it  every night when I get home. I am not really into forensic science, and I  cannot explain how they always get the end result within an hour. Nevertheless,  they always do.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We are committed to cohesion, sharing and integration.  Although, as yet, there may not be a final product, the DUP is committed to  producing a strategy that provides the right results &mdash; a peaceful and  prosperous Northern Ireland.  That commitment and that work ethic are already in action through the OFMDFM  Committee; projects are in motion, and the Committee is responding to them.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Richt noo OFMDFM haes a&rsquo; guid freenly unit, whuch brings  tha tither woark fae aw iver tha Proavince sic as woarkin wi&rsquo; groups fae aw  sieds, as weel as yung yins an&rsquo; ethic minority groups.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">This soart o&rsquo; woark is oan gaun an is weel abel tae staun  oan it&rsquo;s ain, an isnae dependin oan a&rsquo; puttin tha tither o&rsquo; a paper dokumint. An  as we spauk it is poorin it&rsquo;s woark intae fowks lievs</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At present, OFMDFM has a good relations unit that  co-ordinates work across the Province by working with community groups, youth  teams and ethnic minority groups.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That work is ongoing and steadfast, and it is not reliant  on the production of a paper document; it is poring into people&rsquo;s lives as we  speak.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">OFMDM also works closely with the Community Relations  Council and funds the work that it does in the community. CRC works with local  councils on projects that enhance and encourage communities to live peaceably  with each other and to work within a framework that breaks down community  divides while allowing each community to retain its independence and cultural  identity.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">OFMDFM has constantly promoted the ideal of a shared  future, and it is certain that we are seeing the fruits of the efforts that  have been made by hundreds of people. For example, North   Belfast has benefited from the youth work that has been carried  out there and the work that has been done to reduce interface violence in that  area. My colleague Nelson McCausland will probably wish to speak about that  later in the debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Ethnic minority groups have received funding of almost &pound;1  million in order to promote integration. In my constituency of Strangford,  community groups have received funding to put on international days, during  which residents of all the ethnic minority groups in the Ards borough can build  bonds with their neighbours. Those schemes have been successful in my own area  and throughout the Province.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Personally, and as a DUP Member, I welcome much of the &lsquo;A  Shared Future&rsquo; document; it has a role to play in moving Northern Ireland  forward. However, its ideas are already being integrated into community life,  and although the documentation has not been completed, the work has not  stopped.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That is not to say that things are perfect; they are not.  One need only look at the attacks on Orange Halls to see that things are not as  they should be. Those attacks are damnable, and it is imperative that they are  stopped immediately in order for us to move on. It appears to me that projects  that work with affected people and young people are the best way of ensuring a  better future for everyone. That is the reason why OFMDFM &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Given that we are talking about true integration and full equality, will the  Member then call upon his colleague Minister Wilson to withdraw his remarks  that people who have roots here and live here should have preference for jobs  over others?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  He will have to answer for himself, but I have no issues with that. I am happy  to promote jobs for everyone, and I make that my business wherever I am.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are better ways of ensuring a better future for  everyone, and it is for that reason that OFMDFM has been working and will  continue with its work and provide funding.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP amendment refers to housing. Tomorrow morning, the  Minister for Social Development and I will speak about a new housing scheme  that involves 40 units in Newtownards. That shows that we are working within  the process.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP wants a resolution to the problems with getting the  document finalised, but, in the interim, no one is sitting back on their heels;  we are on the ground and doing the business. We are at the beginning of a long  road towards a shared future, and we will see the journey through to the end.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I oppose the motion and the  amendment. In common with the proposer of the motion, I want to see the publication  of a cohesion, sharing and integration document. However, that must be a  programme that delivers, and any attempt to eradicate the twin evils of racism  and sectarianism must be based on true equality and inclusion. It is only when  that foundation has been laid that the kind of shared and better future that  everyone wants &mdash; in which everyone is regarded and treated equally &mdash; can begin  to be built.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the proposer of the motion and the proposer  of the amendment will share my hope that the CSI framework will act as a road  map towards that society. I welcome the commitment that the deputy First  Minister made to provide the necessary financial resources to roll out the  programme, and I am sure that the First Minister would also make that commitment.  I also acknowledge the ongoing work and the ongoing funding arrangements that  are in place to promote equality and good relations while we await the  publication of the document.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister was informed that funding to support the integration of  minority ethnic groups rose from around &pound;600,000 in 2007 to &pound;1 million in 2008.  It was also told that the budget for the good relations programme rose from &pound;21  million in the previous Administration to &pound;28 million, an increase of 33%. As  was mentioned earlier, &pound;500,000 was committed to youth interface projects.  Nevertheless, I understand people&rsquo;s frustration at the delay in publishing the document.  However, millions of pounds of public money have been poured into failed  strategies in the past, and many of those strategies have changed nothing.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A Shared Future, which is a legacy policy, ignored the  reality that the past structures of the unionist regime and British state  actively promoted sectarianism through a wide range of direct policies and  deliberate outcomes.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  No, you will have time to make your point later.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Divisions in our society, such as sectarianism and racism,  manifest themselves in several different ways &mdash; as individual or group actions  and attitudes or through processes. However, sectarianism and racism also  occur, and thrive, within structural inequalities. A Shared Future did not  acknowledge that fact, let alone do anything to address it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We have also witnessed the creation of a quasi  good-relations industry in which all kinds of groups and quangos have sprung up  to take advantage of the public money that was being thrown into the  shared-future agenda. However, that did little to change the reality on the  ground. Therefore, although I share concerns over the delay, Sinn F&eacute;in cannot  support any motion that defends the failed and flawed legacy of the old,  shared-future agenda. Lessons must be learned from the mistakes that have been  made or we are doomed to repeat them.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The new good-relations approach must be different. It must  change outcomes, and if that means taking time to get it right, then, despite  the frustration, that approach is correct. There are already many good examples  of genuine cohesion and integration at community grass-roots level; one need  only look at the joint-community initiatives that are taking place between the  Falls and the Shankill, and elsewhere.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The CSI approach must build on those examples, and on the  existing legal framework and practices, which are designed to deliver equality  for all. There can be no hierarchy of equality. Any good-relations document  must be based on due regard for the promotion of equality of opportunity and on  addressing relations between all section 75 vulnerable groups.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Social need is also closely interrelated to cohesion,  sharing and integration. Both the St Andrews Agreement and the Programme for  Government set the context for tackling poverty through the criterion of  objective need. Therefore, in rejecting the amendment, I hope that the  determining factor for the allocation of houses is need rather than creed. That  should, of course, be the case across all programmes and policies. At present,  meeting the needs of people is being undermined by the pursuit of a flawed  shared-future agenda that prioritises the social engineering of mixed  communities over the objective need of those who are homeless &mdash; shame on it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that it is not the case that the proposer and  supporters of the motion talk about how much they want a shared and better  future while wishing to maintain the same structures, patterns and outcomes of  deprivation that make people&rsquo;s lives a misery. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Unlike Mr Shannon, I have no proverbs to quote. However, I will point out that  the Ulster Unionist Party has a commitment built into its constitution to seek  a shared society based on pluralism and a respect for diversity; values that we  in the Ulster Unionist party bring to the debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It was interesting to hear Ms Anderson talk about the old  shared-future agenda. I wonder what that was. Was it the bombing, shooting and  murdering of people in this Province? I am not sure whether that was what she  was referring to. Certainly, shared-future values are not blind to some of the  harsh realities that we have lived through in the past 30 years of violence  that has, inevitably, left a painful legacy of division, which must be  approached with sensitivity and care.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">No Government can make people tolerant or respectful of  each other. However, it is the Government&rsquo;s solemn obligation to uphold and  promote respect, tolerance and pluralism. That does not mean that we can be  forced together. People in this society cannot be forced together. There is a  responsibility to build relationships, which have not been good over the past  30 years.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  understand the Member&rsquo;s point about not forcing people to live together, and I  do not support any degree of social engineering. Does he agree that there is a  demand from a large section of the population for mixing in education, leisure,  workplaces and housing and that the state does not provide the facilities that  will allow people who want to integrate to do so?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I accept that in many respects. The Member is quite right, and I thank him for  his intervention. The difficulty is that people cannot be forced together in  circumstances in which they do not want to be together, whether it be living,  being educated or socialising together. However, the Assembly, as society&rsquo;s  political leaders, has a responsibility to attempt to build those  relationships.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Since the return of devolution, however, the two main  parties &mdash; rather than genuinely trying to share power &mdash; have held each other at  bay in what has, basically, been a mutual stand-off of mutual loathing. Rather  than making decisions that are based on co-operation and a genuine belief in a  normalised and shared future for the people of Northern Ireland, they have carved  up power and retained a them-and-us mentality.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: Get  used to it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  That is a fact that we heard yesterday: get used to it. Certainly, we in this  party will not get used to it just like that, and I am sure that that view is  shared by others.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, we witnessed Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Education Minister  praising a convicted terrorist when she was speaking to children. We have  witnessed the deputy First Minister describe the democratic political beliefs  of over half the people of Northern    Ireland as evil. The real evil in this  society is the people who murdered, bombed and shot this Province almost to a  standstill for over 30 years.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, people have criticised organisations such as  the Orange Order. The Orange Order has been to the fore in promoting civil and  religious liberties for all in this society. Mr Shannon spoke of Orange Halls  being attacked, just as GAA halls have been attacked. I condemn all such  attacks on not only individual organisations, but on this entire society.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">This society must be built on mutual respect. Although I do  not agree with all the GAA&rsquo;s ethos, rules and regulations, I have a respect for  those who do and who want to promote that organisation and play its sports.  What I ask for is mutual respect from those same people for the organisations  in which I believe and of which I am part. I want them to respect that and to  show me the same understanding that I show them. That requires co-operation,  listening to each other and being confident in one&rsquo;s own organisation and  argument.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">This week, the Assembly witnessed the two main parties  accept none of the amendments to the Financial Assistance Bill that other  political parties tabled in genuine faith. The Ulster Unionist Party believes  in a Northern Ireland  that is based on tolerance and respect. Those values are core to the British  identity. The United Kingdom  is a genuinely pluralist place that thrives on its diversity. That is evident  in everyday life, and is becoming more evident in this Province of Northern    Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We must strive to develop respect in such a way that  different cultures and traditions can be celebrated in a shared Northern Ireland.  We must strive to learn more about our differences and to recognise that from  those differences emerges genuine interdependence. Everyone in this society  must learn to have genuine respect for one another.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I very much believe in a shared and better future, as is stated in the  Programme for Government. Much is being done to move in that direction. The  Department of Finance and Personnel has set aside &pound;30 million over the next  three years, which is a significant increase on previous funding, to make  progress in that direction and to promote cohesion.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A good-relations group is chaired by the junior Ministers  and involves people from the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Community  Relations Council, and others. Work is being targeted specifically towards North Belfast, which, again, is chaired by the junior  Ministers. Recently, additional funding was directed towards other measures,  such as bonfire initiatives and re-imaging communities, in order to help to  improve community relations.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, much work has been done on a shared future, and  the DUP is ready to make further progress on the issue.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, I must respond to Martina Anderson&rsquo;s point. She  seems to believe that British and unionist rule is behind all the sectarianism  and division in our society. Let me say clearly that that is a thoroughly  sectarian analysis in itself. An honest assessment is that there is a problem  with sectarianism in our society but that it is not restricted to any one  community. Sectarianism is an issue across the board and, indeed, across the  border in the Republic   of Ireland. I suggest  that it ill-beholds someone with Ms Anderson&rsquo;s record to lecture anyone on  matters of sectarianism. I believe in a shared and better future, but I often  wonder whether some of those who proclaim that message genuinely believe in it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Does the Member accept that Ms Anderson was perhaps talking about the old  shared future agenda in which the west bank of Londonderry  was disseminated and almost all the Protestant community left the area?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. We have seen ethnic cleansing in areas  around the border and in North Belfast;  however, I will speak about one of those areas in a moment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I noted Dolores Kelly&rsquo;s comment about Crumlin Road jail and Girdwood, and I  agree that the project there must have a shared site and be a shared initiative  if it is to succeed. However, the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in regard that site as one  that would accommodate single-identity and specifically nationalist housing.  Indeed, Alban Maginness, who I am glad is here today, once described it as a  &ldquo;windfall site&rdquo; for nationalist housing. He also described Torrens  as a &ldquo;windfall site&rdquo;, even though Protestant families were forced out of the  area by a sustained sectarian campaign of intimidation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">On the issue of shared housing in North   Belfast, the Housing Executive helped the local community of  Carrick Hill to erect an arch over the entrance to the estate. Over that arch  are a United Irishmen badge and a welcome sign in Irish. I wonder how many  people from the unionist community will seek housing in that area. That must  also be a shared site if it is to succeed, but it does not seem that that is on  some people&rsquo;s agendas at the moment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to the issue of education and particularly teacher  training, there are teacher-training colleges at St Mary&rsquo;s and Stranmillis.  There is justification for having only one teacher-training college, yet there  is a mixed college at Stranmillis and a Roman Catholic college at St Mary&rsquo;s. If  we are really interested in saving money, I wonder how much could be saved by  amalgamating those colleges. Dolores Kelly and Stephen Farry spoke about  opportunities and the need to save money. I wonder whether Dolores Kelly, in  particular, will step up to the line on that issue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Following on from Tom Elliott&rsquo;s point about the Minister of  Education, there is even a primary or nursery school &mdash; I am not sure which &mdash; in  West Belfast that takes its name from Bobby Sands&rsquo;s pen name so that he could  be held up as an icon to the children in that school; indeed, someone  associated with the school said that he was a &ldquo;role model&rdquo;. If that is the view  that some people have of a shared future, I am greatly concerned.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Much can be done, even without waiting for strategy to be  implemented. I ask people to examine the figures that the Equality Commission  published recently about its own employment pattern. About one third of the  Equality Commission&rsquo;s staff come from the Protestant community and almost two  thirds come from the Roman Catholic community. Indeed, the Equality  Commission&rsquo;s employment pattern has worsened year after year for the past five  years. The Equality Commission is happy to lecture everyone else, including  Sammy Wilson, on those matters, but it is time that such organisations put  their own houses in order.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I intended to raise a whole range of other issues, but  given that my time in which to speak is drawing to a close, I will finish with  one passing comment. I commend the Irish Football Association&rsquo;s work in  tackling sectarianism. Once again, I encourage and urge the GAA to move forward  into a shared future by abandoning the nationalist elements in its constitution  and the republican trappings that are in the names of some clubs, grounds and  trophies. That would open the GAA&rsquo;s doors to unionists as well as nationalists,  which would be a step towards a better and shared future.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before calling Jennifer McCann, I ask Members to make their  contributions address the motion as much as possible.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to speak  in this debate. Divisions in society take on many forms in respect of the  individual, the group and structural inequalities.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">For me, one of the biggest flaws of &lsquo;A Shared Future&rsquo; is  that it still fails to recognise the state&rsquo;s role in creating those structural  inequalities. Tom Elliott and Nelson McCausland deliberately did not mention  the violence of the state, which was directly or indirectly responsible for  murdering hundreds of Irish citizens. It is a bit rich listening to them  lecturing Members on this side of the House.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Does the Member accept that the DUP&rsquo;s position on violence has been consistent  and is rather different from that of the two Members from the same party who  spoke and who both have a record of violence?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  No; I do not accept that point.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The documents focus on the role of individuals and groups  and are weakened by their failure to challenge institutional discrimination and  by their lack of emphasis on the need for a national reconciliation unit to  drive good relations on the island. It is not only about shared space or  understanding; it is about tackling inequalities and discrimination, no matter  what quarter they come from. We must challenge existing patterns of  disadvantage and need in areas across the North, and we must challenge in particular  the underinvestment in certain disadvantaged areas that has resulted in people  living in need and in greater disadvantage.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">&lsquo;A Shared Future&rsquo; must tackle all forms of inequality,  including discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, sexual  orientation and disability. Diversity in society should be seen as something  that enriches, rather than divides, communities. As some Members said, the  community and voluntary sector plays a key role. In West   Belfast, local community organisations work with people in  interface areas. Those representatives can teach local people how to tackle  sectarianism, racism and other inequalities.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The North of Ireland must be viewed as a changing society.  An increasing number of families from all backgrounds and ethnic minorities  live and work here. It is incumbent on leaders here, especially political  leaders, to show those groups that they are welcome, given that they contribute  positively to life here and work in hospitals and so on. That must be  recognised.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Programme for Government calls for the North of Ireland  to become a peaceful, inclusive, prosperous and stable society that is founded  on the achievement of reconciliation, tolerance and mutual trust with the  protection and vindication of human rights for all. Everyone in society needs  to enjoy equality of opportunity and be valued and respected. Equality is the  key to building a shared future, and no one in the Chamber &mdash; or outside it &mdash;  should be afraid of equality for all. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  At the outset, I declare an interest as a member of Limavady Borough Council.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to contribute to the debate. A shared future  is one the key indicators of true progress to a peaceful and stable future.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In the foreword of the document &lsquo;A Shared Future&rsquo;, the then  Secretary of State, Paul Murphy MP, said that a move towards &ldquo;relationships  rooted in mutual recognition&rdquo; is an important part of creating a shared future.  I cannot disagree with that view. The document also outlines the:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;desirability of promoting good relations between  persons of different religious belief, political opinion&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Furthermore, it says:</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="font-size:8.5pt; ">&ldquo;it will be incumbent on every individual and organisation in Northern Ireland to play their part to promote a  shared Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I can see the benefits that meeting those  aspirations will bring to the people of Northern Ireland and to the Budget.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Part 1 of &lsquo;A Shared Future: First Triennial Action Plan  2006-2009&rsquo; states that all individuals should be treated equally. I believe  that many people in our communities are doing just that: treating each other  equally. However, a major stumbling block exists to the desirability of  promoting good relations between persons of different political opinion.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">You may well ask why I see a stumbling block, and I am  happy to supply an answer. As an example, on Limavady Borough Council, where I  have served the entire community for 24 years, the six unionist councillors are  treated as second-class citizens &mdash; with complete disrespect, and what borders  on contempt. As long as that behaviour continues, the Utopia that the Members  opposite say they want as a shared future is nothing but a pipe dream.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  No, I will not.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">On 24 June 2008, junior Minister Kelly stated that he is:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;committed to the principle of equality for all  citizens.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Perhaps that junior Minister and his party leadership  should tell some of their party&rsquo;s local councillors that that is party policy,  because they do the exact opposite. They cause division, they cause distrust,  and they do not seem to care.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It also must be said that some of their SDLP colleagues continually  support them, and cannot escape their share of blame for the distrust caused.  On 30 May 2008, junior Minister Donaldson said:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Social cohesion is based on changing mindsets.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Those are the most practical and sensible words  that I have heard for a long time in relation to this issue. When Sinn F&eacute;in and  the SDLP show respect for their unionist opponents in all elected bodies, we  will be setting an example for the change of mindset that is required, and not  before.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  It is easy for people to offer words; sometimes words can be used to benefit  and sometimes to disadvantage. I heard Jennifer McCann talk about the need to  see some leadership and to work together. She spoke about everywhere else  except this place. I will take no lectures about a shared future &mdash; either from  that side of the House or from the opposite side &mdash; when every time we try to  put forward constructive proposals, we are cut down. There is an opportunity to  avoid going back to the past.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Last night, I spoke to a group of young people of mixed  backgrounds, aged 16 or 17, along with a panel of other folk. They got  extremely exercised about the topical issue of the Eames/Bradley report. What I  saw was that those young people, who know nothing of the past 30 to 40 years of  bombing, shooting and maiming, have not learnt the lesson. They all want to go  back and rake up coals, to poke their fingers into places to see what is there.  If we continually rub salt into wounds, we are not going to move forward. There  are people deliberately, in my opinion, misrepresenting the comments of others.  They seek to take party-political advantage of things, and to say that they are  right and everybody else is wrong. How can there be a shared future without  some form of respect for another point of view?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Does a shared future have any credibility? Look at the  sectarian carve up that happens in nearly every part of our society. Is there  some agreement on a common identity; some sort of unified vision; some sort of  commonality that would bind us all together? Talk about who has been to places  &mdash; I have been to a GAA match; I have been to the SDLP conference; I have been  to the Gay Pride parade. I have been to those events, because tolerance is not  something that is preached, it is something that is shown. I see precious  little of it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Yes, I will give way, but it is not something that comes easily, because any  time I try to make an intervention it is not accepted. I will accept the  intervention.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  The Member sits on Lisburn City Council; would he say that there is tolerance  in that council for the Sinn F&eacute;in members? Unionists have deliberately excluded  them from committees for years. Discrimination has gone on for years on that  council.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  One can take any particular set of circumstances and find fault almost  anywhere. The challenge for us here is to find a way of showing some  leadership. I am not sure that I see it. There is talk of some sort of mythical  people, and of people from working-class communities getting together, and  everything is fine.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I do not see that &mdash; because I see the problems here in the  Assembly. People are looking to the Assembly to keep up with the moves that  they have made. I have a real fear that if we do not start putting emphasis on  building a shared future, or a common future, or whatever one wants to call it,  we will, at some stage, return to the trials and tribulations of the past.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I think that the Member will get an extra minute &mdash; I am sure that everybody  will be pleased to hear that. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Member for giving way. Martina Anderson said  that the strategy A Shared Future was set up under direct rule. It now  transpires that Sinn F&eacute;in is adopting the Lifetime Opportunities strategy,  which it binned, because the party could not come up with anything better in  its absence. It was not the SDLP, the UUP or the Alliance Party that promised  such a strategy &mdash; it was the two parties in OFMDFM that promised the strategy  and failed to deliver it. Does the Member agree that Sinn F&eacute;in should look for  the beam in its own eye?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Member for her intervention. It is good that I have an extra  minute, because she took one minute and 30 seconds to tell me. It demonstrates  that a certain amount of humour can go a long way. We sometimes point out the  ridiculous position that others adopt, as she has just done.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have had my fair share of people putting me right on a  thing or two today&mdash; mainly when I have not been in the Chamber. I find that  really disappointing, because I will take on anybody. I accept that there are  people of good intent on all sides who want to produce a strategy on which we  can work.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will probably get it in the neck for saying this, but I  sometimes wonder what OFMDFM is for. It is so bereft of ideas that it tries to  grab powers from other Departments. If building a shared future is the central  issue, let us get on with it. Let us have genuine engagement and mutual respect  for all the good points that were made on all sides of the House. It is a  fundamental challenge, and this Assembly must show leadership. As my colleague  Tom Elliott said, it is fundamental to the approach of the Ulster Unionist  Party. We will continue to defend civil liberties.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The wording and intent of the  motion need to be examined. I want to look at particular aspects of the motion  and &mdash; like my colleagues who spoke previously &mdash; the framework for a shared  future. I will also talk about community relations, division and sectarianism.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">&lsquo;A Shared Future&rsquo; was a direct rule and NIO strategy  document that this Assembly inherited, and it consistently failed to address  the reasons why people have been &mdash; and continue to be &mdash; excluded. The emphasis  of the analysis has always been on the need for people&rsquo;s attitudes and values  to change &mdash; that everything could be different if the two problem communities  could be brought together. That has been the message that community relations,  and shared future, enthusiasts have peddled, and it needs to change.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The emphasis of a new strategy must be that it has the  principle of equality at its very core. We need to incorporate the structural  and historical inequalities that have led to deprivation and marginalisation in  all of our communities. As an elected representative for North Belfast &mdash; and  like many others who live in the area &mdash; I work each day to try to make a  difference for the people who live there.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The problems of sectarianism, homophobia and racism must be  tackled head on. The task of building and developing good relations needs to  take place on our streets, and that will continue to be one of the biggest  challenges that I will face as an elected representative. I have no difficulty  with that &mdash; in fact; it is a privilege to face that challenge. However, it is  imperative that we get the CSI strategy right.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I do not believe that anybody will ignore, ridicule or duck  the challenges of national reconciliation, building good relations and having a  shared and better future for all Irish citizens. In the past, there was too  much of a negative agenda concerning equality matters and objective needs.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Interface violence and sectarianism cannot, and should  never, be tolerated. We must tackle sectarianism head on and investigate its  root causes, not just its symptoms, which is what the existing shared framework  does; that is why we must ensure that we get any new CSI right.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have no doubt that the proposer of the motion wants the  same as I do, and most Members agree with the intent expressed by Basil McCrea.  However, I disagree with some Members&rsquo; analysis, and that is what political  debate is about &mdash; it is my prerogative to disagree with people. I do not  disagree with those Members&rsquo; intent or with their principled positions; I  disagree with their analysis.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: If  I recall correctly, when this matter was debated in a slightly different form  in October 2008, the Member and her colleagues did not disagree with statements  of principles or intent. Can she tell us what has changed in the past three  months?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Can I assume, a LeasCheann Comhairle, that I will be allowed an extra minute?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson</strong>: Yes.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Thank you, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I totally disagree with the existing  shared-future framework, and I have made that clear. Nevertheless, I agree that  we must have a shared, and a better, future. However, in all seriousness,  debates such as this must take place on the streets where people live, and as  elected representatives, we must be aware of what it is like for families to  live in fear or to have three generations living under one roof.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. I was interested to hear her refer to the  rights of every Irish citizen and say that debates must happen on our streets.  Does the Member accept that there are those who do not consider themselves to  be Irish citizens? Furthermore, the history books tell us that when partition  occurred in Ireland, 12% of  the population in what is now the Irish   Republic were  Protestants; today, that figure is 2%. At the time of partition, nationalists  made up 20% of the population of Northern Ireland; whereas, they now  make up more than 40%. Can the Member explain why the Protestant community was  excluded in the Irish   Republic?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention; however, I will not go into the annals  of Irish history to explain what happened. I accept that the Member considers  himself to be British, but as an Irish republican, I consider myself to be  Irish.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has revealed its hand; rather than deliver on  objective need, it proposes that shared-future housing be built on the Girdwood  site in North Belfast, so I thank its Members  for clarifying that point. In order to implement equality measures, we must  consider targeted outcomes on the basis of objective need, because only then  will we have a shared, and a better, future for all. We must get used to  democracy and to the cut and thrust of debate; however, I will not get used to  accepting historical and structural inequalities for ever more. Go raibh maith  agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Ulster Unionist Party believes in a Northern   Ireland, and, indeed, a United Kingdom, based on respect  and tolerance for all. It believes in a shared future for everyone, and if that  is to happen, politicians must take great care with their language, which can  affect those who are less articulate or less able to reason. If we behave  intolerantly, there is a danger that others may follow our lead.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Let us remember that, for many years, when the economy was  successful, Northern Ireland  employers struggled to fill vacancies, and without skills and labourers from  other parts of the European Union, companies such as Moy Park  might have moved its employment elsewhere. Indeed, in my constituency, Schrader  Electronics found it difficult to fill some skilled engineering posts.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Without the skilled engineers who came from other parts of  the United Kingdom and the  European Community, companies in Northern Ireland might have been  unable to fill their customers&rsquo; demands and, subsequently, they would have lost  market share.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members need to be careful in what they do and say and  recognise the skills that have come here. We need a shared future for everyone.  Eva Grossman, a self-employed entrepreneur in my constituency &mdash; and someone for  whom I have a great deal of respect &mdash; is quoted in the Morning View item in  yesterday&rsquo;s &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo;. She said:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Any form of discrimination is not good especially now  during the time of difficulties and hardship for everybody&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">She went on to ask:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Would the hardship experienced by a person born in Northern Ireland  be any different from those from outside?&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">She is saying that everyone is affected in times of  economic hardship. We are suffering an economic downturn, and jobs are being  lost.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Another factor that has contributed to the situation is the  decline in the value of the pound against the euro. Many people who have come  here to take up jobs have found that they are working for much less money than  they had been previously, and they have less to send home or to save and take  home.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members and Ministers should be careful and tolerant in  their language. Everyone hopes that our economy will improve and that we will  return to full employment. Perhaps, some time in the future, we will be  dependent once more on those who are willing to travel and fill our job  vacancies.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">One must remember that Northern Ireland companies are  successful in winning work elsewhere. Farrans and Grahams have won a &pound;100  million contract in Scotland.  How would we feel if their employees &mdash; many of whom come from Northern Ireland &mdash; faced prejudice as they move  to other parts of the United    Kingdom to work? We should ensure that we  are tolerant in all that we do.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">When local politicians use language that is similar to that  used by the BNP, they start to set themselves, and Northern Ireland, apart from  national British public opinion. Such language can appeal to the worst fears  and prejudices of some.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We need a shared future if we are to maximise any economic  opportunities that arise. If we are to obtain the best value from our Budget,  we need to look at shared services and how we can position key public  infrastructure in locations that everyone can use safely so that savings to our  Budget can be made. We cannot afford large duplication in our services.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Martina Anderson ranted against unionists; however, she  overlooked her own personal history and the pain that she has caused to  individuals. Furthermore, she failed to recognise that actions by herself, her  party and their colleagues in arms who used violence against their neighbours,  helped to create barriers in Northern    Ireland. They prevented a shared future, and  they are trying swiftly to distance themselves from those events.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Jennifer McCann also failed to acknowledge those actions.  Provisional Sinn F&eacute;in was responsible for a vast amount of violence and deaths  in Northern Ireland;  it was responsible for the majority of violent events. It is, therefore,  important that a shared future is recognised and that people do not have double  standards.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  On a point of order. On several occasions, the Speaker has ruled on the term  &ldquo;Provisional Sinn F&eacute;in&rdquo;. I also take great exception to the Member&rsquo;s comment  that Sinn F&eacute;in was involved in the killing or murder of anyone or violence  against anyone.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I understand that there is no party called Provisional Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  think that I referred to their colleagues in the Provisional IRA, to which few  doubt they are closely linked. It is important that they recognise their  failings of the past and move forward together.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Will it always require someone from  this party to raise the issue as a point of order without the Speaker or Deputy  Speaker dealing with it?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Is the Member questioning my ability to chair the meeting?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  I certainly am not.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Thank you. I was about to speak, but your colleague intervened  before me.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: It  is important that people recognise &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> I  call the junior Minister Mr Gerry Kelly.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr G Kelly)</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. A series of criticisms have been  made about the delay in bringing forward a policy on cohesion, sharing and  integration. That is a fair criticism. OFMDFM is trying to bring forward a  strategy that will right the wrongs of the past and that will help to heal the  many divisions in our society, which many Members referred to. There is no easy  way or quick-fix solutions to those problems. OFMDFM wants to get it right, and  it is committed to bringing forward that strategy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The previous Shared Future framework was a direct rule  strategy, and it was from a different time. The Assembly and the Executive are  now working, and we have enhanced equality measures designed to protect all  members of our community. We also have a growing and welcome number of ethnic  minority communities. Therefore, we need to bring forward a new strategy now.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As a representative of North Belfast  &mdash; a constituency bisected by interfaces and which has suffered from thousands  of sectarian attacks &mdash; I accept the legitimate criticism about the delay. I,  along with others, have worked to reduce the tension and end violence. I see  the work being done continually by many people who work on the ground at night  and during the weekends. I, and OFMDFM, support all that work.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to provide a direct challenge to the proposers of  the motion. I am concerned about the accusation implicit in the motion, which  claims that the vision of a shared and better future for everyone no longer  matters to Ministers in OFMDFM and the parties that they represent. I want to  emphasise in the strongest possible terms that that is completely untrue. It is  not unreasonable to criticise and question. However, the issue is too important  to play party politics with.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is almost two years since I took up office. During that  time I, and others, have been proud to have played a part in taking practical  steps to nurture the positive progress being made on the ground to build strong  cross-community relationships. Dealing with the debate on the basis that does  not recognise the reality of the situation is disrespecting the substantial  progress that is being achieved.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I said already, our priority is to be active in  practical ways, so that we can be judged on our record, and not by what others  say. I remind Members what the Programme for Government for 2008-2011 states about  our vision for achieving a shared and better future for all:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;equality, fairness, inclusion and the promotion of  good relations will be watchwords for all of our policies and programmes across  Government.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The promotion of good relations cannot be divorced or  separated from equality. Equality is the foundation and prerequisite for  building good relations. To that end, the Executive have made equality central  &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Will the junior Minister confirm that the statement about equality is the  considered opinion of OFMDFM, rather than his personal opinion?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: As the Member will know, these speeches are  generally passed through the First Minister and the deputy First Minister. I am  speaking as a junior Minister for the Executive.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The motion asked Members to express their concerns about  the marginalisation of good relations. Let us examine our track record and  analyse the validity of that marginalisation claim. Let us examine whether we  have been true to that vision.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Through the 2007 spending review, we successfully increased  OFMDFM&rsquo;s budget for good relations and good race relations from &pound;21 million to  &pound;28 million over the CSR period, which has been referred to by several Members.  That is a 33% increase on the funding made available by the previous  Administration. Are we marginalising a shared and better future? I do not think  so.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Funding to support the integration of minority ethnic  groups into communities increased from approximately &pound;600,000 in 2007 to &pound;1  million in 2008, and will continue at &pound;1 million for 2009. That is a 66%  increase. Are we marginalising the importance of new communities? Hardly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Funding for targeting resources at on-the-ground projects  for young people to prevent them being drawn into interface disturbances over  the summer months increased to &pound;500,000 in 2008. Are we marginalising at-risk  or high-risk young people? Absolutely not.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We successfully piloted schools projects in association  with Rangers and Celtic, who acted together to address sectarianism,  specifically in sport. Therefore, the criticism that we have put sectarianism  to the side is also wrong. We have commissioned a short, sharp research project  to identify effective longer-term intervention and support ideas for at-risk  young children.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Perhaps the junior Minister could share those statistics with his party  colleagues, who seem to be at a loss to understand that the Shared Future  framework and action plan, although flawed, is delivering on some of its  priorities?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: I am giving the statistics to everyone. Anna Lo did  not get a chance to speak, but she knows that when the issue of subsuming the Shared  Future policy arose at the commemoration of the Chinese new year last night, we  said that we are building on it. We are making a massive improvement on that,  and the work is being carried out by Ministers and Departments.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We have also worked proactively with all relevant agencies,  local councils and the PSNI to address key problem areas. We have provided over  &euro;50 million to match-fund Peace III funding for measures that OFMDFM is  accountable for &mdash; that is not a marginal contribution to financial resources.  Although some may claim that they have heard that before, others must not have  taken it in. I say again, especially to Dolores Kelly, that it bears repeating.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Rest assured that we have a joined-up approach to ensure  that people in communities with needs see that they are not on the margins of  our work. Some projects were mentioned earlier, so I will explain what goes on,  regardless of whether it is for people in Dungannon, Craigavon, Derry or North Belfast. Our job is to resource and empower people  who work for the benefit of their communities and their neighbouring  communities. When I talk about our record, I am not trying to claim credit for  what those dedicated people do. However, talking about our role is the way to  counter the message that we are marginalising such work, which is the criticism  that is implied by the motion.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As a Minister, I am also financially accountable &mdash; I must  prove that the large amounts of money to which I refer actually make a  difference to how we all live. I have evidence to show Members that we pass the  financial accountability test. My evidence, which is based on independently  sourced research and NISRA official statistics, shows continued improvements in  the range of good-relations indicators. There was a 12% drop in the number of  racist crimes between 2006-07 and 2007-08, and a similar percentage shift in  the number of crimes with a sectarian motive. In 2007, three out of every five  young people &mdash; 60% &mdash; said that relations between Protestants and Catholics were  getting better, which is a significant improvement on the 43% who said that in  2005. Approximately two thirds of adults &mdash; 66% &mdash; in 2007 agreed that community  relations were better than they had been five years ago, compared with 52% in  2005.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The vast majority of people continue to believe that better  relations will come about through more mixing between the two communities,  which several Members mentioned. Support for mixed-religion neighbourhoods  remains high, but, as was pointed out, that situation cannot be forced. People  have to agree to it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The number of parades at which disorder occurred decreased  from 34 in 2005 to 10 in 2007, which is a 70&middot;5% reduction. The proportion of  enrolments for minority-ethnic pupils has increased from 1&middot;8% to 2%. Few people  now think that flag-flying happens more than it did five years ago. Those are  indications of positive outcomes and are selected from independent data and  research. We all recognise that challenging work remains, which is why there  will be an incremental increase in the budget over the current year.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">What is the basis for the ongoing investment? Reports have  highlighted several challenges that still have to be overcome. For example, in  2007, there was a clear increase in self-reported prejudice towards people from  ethnic minorities &mdash; 35%, compared with 24% in 2006.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The number of applications to industrial tribunals on the  grounds of racial discrimination has increased from 79 complaints in 2005-06 to  108 in 2006-07. Support for inward EU migration &mdash; people who think that it is a  good thing &mdash; has fallen from 76% in 2005 to 68% in 2007.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Advancing social transformation and the inclusion of all  our people is essential if we are to deliver the peaceful, fair and healthy  society that we all want. Real progress has been made in recent years, and our  society continues to be transformed. However, significant challenges remain to  be addressed if everyone is to be given the opportunity to contribute to, and  to benefit from, a shared and better future.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We have always emphasised the importance that we attach to  the equality agenda, and I reassure Members and communities that we are  ensuring that all our legislation meets the standards set by European  directives. At this stage, we continue to achieve that by amending regulations  to existing legislation. By promoting good relations in that practical way, we  seek to challenge and support our communities to become places where any  person, regardless of who they are, can live, work, rest and socialise in  respect, acceptance, safety and freedom from violence &mdash; words that were used by  many Members today.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At central Government level, strong political leadership is  essential for the success of the strategy. We envisage that the establishment  of the new ministerial-led good-relations panel will oversee the work across  Government, in local government and with key stakeholders to tackle the issues  that I mentioned.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A strategic action plan and locally delivered action plans  will be developed and implemented, which will skilfully take account of all  good-relations and good race-relations issues through complementary bottom-up,  top-down approaches.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment asks us to recognise the potential that  social and affordable housing initiatives offer to the goal of creating a  shared and integrated society. The provision of social housing must, in the  first instance, be based on objective need. Homeless people and those who are  living in cramped or unsatisfactory houses need homes, and we need to provide  them. We also need to build not only estates, but communities that are safe,  secure and open to all. Equality means that housing should meet objective need,  regardless of race, religion or membership of any minority group. People have  the right to live wherever they choose.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to give credit to the innovative work of the Housing  Executive with local people who want to see their segregated communities become  places that are safe and welcoming, where anyone can live. Therefore, I give  credit to communities in Springfarm in Antrim, Carren Crescent in Enniskillen,  Ballynafeigh in Belfast, Clanmil in Lisburn and  in the village of   Sion Mills. One or two  other projects were also mentioned earlier. Those communities are turning that  large percentage of people who would prefer to live in mixed neighbourhoods  into reality.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">By way of confirming that we recognise the importance of  those initiatives, only last Thursday, OFMDFM facilitated discussions between  community relations officers in all 26 district councils and the staff in the  Housing Executive&rsquo;s International Fund for Ireland-sponsored project, to  co-ordinate that very issue, along with the effects of the re-imaging  communities, community bridges and Peace III programmes.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Those are ambitious and comprehensive objectives; they are  essential for us all to accept. I also firmly believe that they are achievable,  and that we are reflecting the aspirations of all our people.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members spoke, and I dealt with many of the issues  earlier, but there are some pressing matters. Stephen Farry praised direct  rule, which does not surprise me, because, under direct rule, the Alliance  Party was involved in all the quangos, and it still seems to be involved in  them.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Dolores Kelly mentioned the strategy, and I said earlier  that it will be brought forward around Hallowe&rsquo;en. We will give a commitment to  try to bring forward the strategy as soon as possible and work towards that.  That is another commitment that I have given.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Martina Anderson made a point about equality and good  relations, and the fact that equality &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Minister must draw his remarks to a close.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: A commitment was made to make resources available  for equality and good relations, and, as we have already said, OFMDFM will  fulfil that commitment.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before calling Mr Alban Maginness to make his winding-up speech, I  must inform Members that we tried very hard to call Anna Lo because of her  special contribution to the debate. I regret that that was not possible.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The debate was comprehensive, and many issues have been unearthed. One of the  main reasons for the motion and the amendment was to determine the nature of  the Administration&rsquo;s thoughts on the shared-future concept. Having listened to  junior Minister Kelly, I am no wiser about what the Administration thinks. Its  approach appears to be confused and, at best, cryptic; they do not give any  clear and coherent leadership on the matter.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, there appears to be a serious difference between  the three Sinn F&eacute;in Members who spoke during the debate and junior Minister  Kelly on the issues that he raised and the comments that he made. Those Sinn  F&eacute;in Members talked about equality; it seems to me that they are prepared to  accept equality, but, at the same time, separation. The whole aim of any  good-relations policy is to integrate the community and bring people together  where, traditionally and historically, we have been divided. If one is to wait  for absolute equality in our community, one will be waiting for ever. One can  never bridge differences to the point at which equality is perfectly  established. That seemed to me to be Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s basic thesis.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It seems to me that a fundamental problem exists between  Sinn F&eacute;in and other parties in the House, and the DUP in particular, which at  least pays lip service to the idea of a shared future. The other parties &mdash; the  Ulster Unionists, my party and the Alliance Party &mdash; all agree on a shared  future, and that we must mend and bind together the divisions of the past.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is all very well to say that inequality is the reason  for our divisions. It is about more than inequality. We had a civil war here  for 30 years in which many people were killed. Those who were responsible for  that, in part, were those who purported to be the provisional republican  movement, and it bears a major share of the responsibility for that division.  However, it does not own up to, accept or tackle that responsibility. It is now  time that they did.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members have expressed a wish to move forward on a  shared basis. To criticise ideas such as integrated housing and integrated  education, as some people have done, is quite wrong. If the community voluntarily  were to come together by way of shared housing or shared education, it would be  a good thing. However, one of our fundamental requirements is goodwill in the  House and in the Administration. I do not see any evidence of that in this  Administration between the two major parties. I see evidence of a power  carve-up, but that is co-existence &mdash; it is cold war instead of active war. That  is no way to run an Administration or to encourage people in the community.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Good Friday Agreement was a conflict-resolution  process, not a conflict-substitution process. However, some people see it as a  conflict-substitution process, and believe that the war should continue by some  other means.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We must end that mentality. The two political traditions,  which we cherish and should respect, must show some goodwill towards each  other; without that we will not make progress. However, Members must give good  example to the community and show leadership, as Mr Beggs said, and voting for  the motion is one way of showing that leadership. At least among some parties  there is unity of approach.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: In  proposing the motion, Stephen Farry outlined the motivation for it: the failure  of OFMDFM to live up to the rhetoric that it inserted into the Programme for  Government; and the failure to deliver on anything more than a slight updating  of the shared future policy, which, if I remember correctly, was not quite  published during the first period of devolution and delivered under direct  rule. Mr Kelly is correct: so far, direct rule has been better for community  relations in Northern    Ireland than devolution. Dr Farry also  emphasised the importance of a shared future as the key to dealing with some of  our other problems, especially those of growing the economy by dealing with  matters such as labour mobility, attracting inward investment and coping with  the situation revealed by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Northern  Ireland report on our carbon footprint.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We, at this end of the House, have no problem in seeing  OFMDFM develop a strategy: the problem is that it has not yet produced a  strategy and is not developing one.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Dolores Kelly, in proposing the amendment, emphasised  points that the Alliance Party holds in common with the SDLP. She spoke of the  cost of segregation and referred to the motion that she and her colleagues  tabled in October, which called for the publication of the strategy. We seek to  update that call today, and we have done so appropriately. We accept the  amendment. There are other issues besides those relating to DSD; but the DSD  issues are a part of the matter.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I was interested, as ever, to hear Jim Shannon&rsquo;s  contribution. He said that, as a member the OFMDFM Committee, he could see the  threads of a policy being woven together. Mr Shannon may see that happening,  but the rest of us &mdash; including my colleague on that Committee &mdash; see precious  little evidence of it. I welcome Jim Shannon&rsquo;s endorsement of the concept of a  peaceful and prosperous Northern    Ireland, but, unfortunately, he did not use  the word &ldquo;shared&rdquo;. However, that is forward movement by the DUP, and we welcome  it in the spirit in which we seek to promote good relations in this place.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The next contribution was by Martina Anderson who told us,  yet again, that equality came first; as far as I could make out, it also came  last in her analysis. That is utter nonsense. Must we wait for ever or until  there is full equality in society before we can address the problems of good  relations? That is a counsel of utter despair. It is complete nonsense, and it  carries no weight in this Chamber unless, possibly, with members of Sinn F&eacute;in.  To suggest that nothing could happen on good relations until the DUP agree with  Sinn F&eacute;in on the wicked sectarianism of unionism in the past and the failure of  the sectarian British state shows that she plans to implement a long agenda  before countenancing any forward movement in good relations. Her points were  supported by Jennifer McCann and Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">When Jennifer McCann listed for our benefit all the  categories listed in section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, she did not  say that section 75 refers to &ldquo;promoting good relations&rdquo; as well as to  equality. Every Sinn F&eacute;in member who spoke showed the same blinkered vision  when it came to that. Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n also spoke of a shared future as a  failed policy. She fails to accept that all that is being implemented by OFMDFM  is the outworkings of the existing shared future policy because that Department  does not have a strategy of its own.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Tom Elliott, backed by his Ulster Unionist colleagues Basil  McCrea and Roy Beggs, also supported the motion and felt a need to defend  unionist culture. In view of all that was said in the Chamber that was hardly  surprising. One might have hoped that they would have gone a little further.  However, their references to tolerance and diversity in the UK are to be  welcomed. In particular, Roy Beggs&rsquo;s references to the economic contribution to  some of our new citizens must be endorsed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">When Nelson McCausland said that the DUP believes in a  shared and better future, he included the word that Mr Shannon missed, so I  congratulate him for that. He also said that the DUP wants to move forward. It  was interesting to note that he then chose to immediately disagree with the  points made by Ms Anderson, the principal speaker for the DUP&rsquo;s principal  partner in this Government. I wonder whether that is an indication of where the  problem lies in the failure to do anything about the CSI strategy. Today, it  appears that DUP Members are prepared to reach in the direction of those at  this end of the Chamber to a certain extent. However, Sinn F&eacute;in, Members are  giving absolutely nothing.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If I had been cynical enough to have blamed David Trimble  for the failure to move forward in the past, I would now apologise to the  Ulster Unionist Party and I would also acknowledge that it is not the Ulster  Unionists and the DUP that appear to be creating the biggest block at this  point.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is unfortunate when someone such as George Robinson  merely states his problems with being treated as being in the minority in  Limavady Borough Council, which allows others to cite their problems with how  they have being treated as being in the minority in Lisburn City Council. If  Members cannot get away from the notion of simply being concerned about how  they and their immediate colleagues are being treated, this strategy will not  move forward. The problems are legitimate and true, but we need to reach beyond  such simple points.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The response from Gerry Kelly, speaking as Minister, was  interesting. He acknowledged that criticism of the delay was fair &mdash; at least  that is something. After all that we have been through during these past few  days in debating the Financial Assistance Bill, it is good that the junior  Minister has provided that level of acknowledgment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I do not believe that there was an implication that OFMDFM  does not care about what we are saying. However, there is a clear implication  that it does not care enough to put together a proper strategy. We have seen  and heard junior Minister Kelly&rsquo;s party colleagues dismiss the strategy as  out-dated and inappropriate, but we have yet to see them develop anything with  which to replace it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Spending money on the old position does not seem to tie in  with Mr Kelly&rsquo;s financial accountability as a junior Minister. He highlighted  that he should be ensuring that there is a proper, up-to-date and  fit-for-purpose strategy that he and his colleagues can implement and can be  fully accountable for. However, there were two things missing from his  contribution: first, the recognition that issues around a shared future and  good relations are not a small part of OFMDFM; they are a key cross-cutting  theme for what is supposed to be a power-sharing inclusion Government;  secondly, the promise of something specific. At the end of his statement he  promised something soon. However, I was taught some time ago that the word  &ldquo;soon&rdquo; is not a date. It really is time that we had something much more  specific.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In that respect, I believe that Alban Maginness&rsquo;s comments  about the lack of leadership from OFMDFM are accurate. He suggested that Sinn  F&eacute;in was proposing that a form of separate but equal &mdash; and I can think of a  rather rude word for that strategy &mdash; was desirable. It is not desirable: it is  the absolute opposite of what we need if we want to move forward. I recognise  that some DUP Members seem to understand that point.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Thirty years ago, fair employment was some kind of pipe  dream. Now, it is effectively in place. Today, the demand for integrated  education, or different forms of shared education, and integrated housing, are  growing. Sports bodies, such as the IFA and the GAA, are engaging and working  together, yet the body that is supposed to be providing leadership to the  community &mdash; the Executive, led by OFMDFM &mdash; are failing to deliver.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">When one looks back 40 years to the assassination of Martin  Luther King and to the way in which other societies in the world have moved on,  the types of ideas that Sinn F&eacute;in speakers have raised would have been laughed  out of court in the US; they would have been laughed out of court in South  Africa; and, please God, they will soon be laughed out of court in Zimbabwe as  well.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: Our  community has been enriched by a wide variety of people from different  backgrounds, whether they arrived three months ago or 500 years ago. That is  the key message that must go out today. It is not a matter of saying: let us  pretend that we can live in some separate but equally miserable set of  communities. We must oppose the nonsense that Sinn F&eacute;in Members have said in  that respect.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Whether it is called community relations, good relations,  or cohesion, sharing and integration, it is not an optional add-on; it is a  vital necessity as a cross-cutting theme of every aspect of Government policy.  There are sound social, economic and environmental reasons why a shared future  should be given a much higher priority, and why the CSI strategy is badly  needed.</p>

        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="7"></a>private notice question</p>
        <p class="H4StageHeading">Employment of Foreign Nationals</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I have received a private notice question, in accordance  with Standing Order 20, to the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister. I call the junior Minister the Rt Hon Jeffrey Donaldson.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs D Kelly asked OFMDFM, in light of junior Minister  Donaldson&rsquo;s concurrence with the view of Minister Sammy Wilson, that employers  should give jobs to locals ahead of foreign nationals who live and work in  Northern Ireland, irrespective of their skills, experience or abilities; and  recalling the longstanding body of UK and European legislation outlawing  discrimination on grounds of race or nationality, to explain how these remarks  align with legislation to promote good relations, community cohesion, and  integration between people from different racial groups.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr  Donaldson)</strong>: The Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  received the private notice question from Mrs Kelly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In the Programme for Government, the Executive agreed to  build a peaceful, fair and prosperous society in Northern Ireland. The Programme for  Government makes clear that equality, fairness, inclusion and the promotion of  good relations will be the watchwords of all our policies. We have underlined  that by making &pound;1 million available under the ethnic-minority development fund  for projects and developmental work with ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If a person is legally entitled to work here, as most EU  citizens are, the law is very clear that employers are required to recruit  staff on a fair basis.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Race Relations (Northern Ireland) Order 1997  applies to all employment applicants and employees who are legally entitled to  work here, and outlaws discrimination on the grounds of colour, race,  nationality, or ethnic or national origin.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  It is regrettable that junior Minister Donaldson merely reiterated  part-speeches that were given to various gatherings on the responsibilities of OFMDFM.  In light of what the junior Minister said about EU legislation and about  legislation in Northern Ireland  and Great Britain,  I draw his attention to the comments that Minister Sammy Wilson made at the  weekend that firms should give jobs to locals ahead of foreign nationals in the  current economic downturn.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">On BBC&rsquo;s &lsquo;Stormont Live&rsquo; television programme, the junior  Minister concurred with some of those remarks. Will the junior Minister now ask  OFMDFM to ask Minister Wilson to withdraw his remarks? Will he also acknowledge  that if local firms were to follow Minister Wilson&rsquo;s advice, they would be  prosecuted under existing legislation, and that the comments send out a very  poor message to foreign nationals who have come to work and live here? Indeed,  some of those foreign nationals work in the Assembly.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">The junior Minister (Mr Donaldson): I will not ask the  Minister of the Environment to withdraw his comments &mdash; that is not my job.  Immigration rules dictate who is entitled to work here, and the Race Relations  (Northern Ireland)  Order 1997 applies only to those people who are entitled to work here.  Employers must comply with the statutory obligations of any employee who is  entitled to work here.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, in times of economic downturn, it is perfectly  legitimate to question whether immigration policy needs to be restricted  further for economic migrants. Minister Wilson is entitled to participate in  that debate and discussion. Indeed, that debate might be more rational if  others contributed to it in a more rational way.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion made:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Assembly do now adjourn. &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Mr  Deputy Speaker.]</span></span></p>
        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="8"></a>Adjournment</p>
        <p class="H4StageHeading">The Retention of Jobs and Benefits Office Posts and  Services in Omagh.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The proposer of the Adjournment topic will have 15 minutes in  which to speak. All other Members who wish to speak will have approximately  five minutes.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McElduff: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  In 2006, management at the Social Security Agency (SSA) initiated a strategic  business review to assess its operational structures in order to ensure that  the service could continue in light of funding cuts outlined in the  comprehensive spending review. The Social Security Agency management also cited  staffing problems and raised part-time working, term-time working and sick  absences as issues that needed to be addressed. I suggest that that is  contestable.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The review had various phases, but it concluded with one  preferred option &mdash; a centralisation of back-office processing on 16 sites in  the North, each of which would deal with one benefit only. In many cases, that  would mean staff moving from their current place of work. It has been  calculated that 850 Social Security Agency staff will be forced to redeploy and  that 200 jobs will be lost. That is in addition to the 674 posts that were  already lost as a result of 2004&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fit for Purpose&rsquo; review.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister for Social Development approved the public  consultation that was launched on 27 November, and I understand that that  consultation closes later this week. It is for that reason that I tabled this  Adjournment topic with the Business Office on 6 January. The title of the  debate is, &ldquo;The Retention of Jobs and Benefits Office Posts and Services in  Omagh&rdquo;. I record my appreciation of the Minister&rsquo;s attendance. I hope that the  Minister will listen carefully and remedy the situation by taking the  appropriate and necessary action as soon as possible.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to the highly professional staff in the local  jobs and benefits office in Omagh who do a first-class job. People in Omagh  felt so strongly about the proposals that they lobbied their local government representatives  and district councillors to hold a special council meeting to address the  issue. Chairman of Omagh District Council, Councillor Martin McColgan, convened  a special meeting to discuss the matter.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">6.45 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">How will the proposals impact on the public? We know that  face-to-face contact on a walk-in basis will no longer be available and that  interviews &mdash; which could take weeks to arrange &mdash; will be available by  appointment only. We know that the proposals are contrary to the findings of a  PricewaterhouseCoopers survey that was commissioned by the agency management,  which found that the majority of customers who were surveyed stated that their  problems could be resolved by direct face-to-face contact only.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Anne Marie Fitzgerald, who is a councillor on Omagh  District Council, recently recounted, at a council meeting, her experience of  making representations on behalf of a young male constituent who had literacy  difficulties. Members should remember that one in four adults in our society  has problems with literacy. She did her best to secure face-to-face contact on  a walk-in basis with the staff at the jobs and benefits office in Omagh in  order to assist a constituent who would not have survived the telephony system.  That story made an impression on me; if that service had been unavailable,  somebody would have been lost in the system.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Many people from ethnic minorities do not use English as  their first language and require more assistance. Therefore, many people would  be lost if the new arrangements were to pertain. Public services would be  greatly reduced, and the most vulnerable members of society will be the losers.  Furthermore, the strategic business review will be used as a platform to  realise further future staffing efficiencies. That is the true aim of the  proposals &mdash; not delivering better services to customers.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, the new telephone systems are untried and  untested here. That may lead to more unnecessary frustration for the public at  a time when they need a vital service. Unemployment figures are currently  soaring, and the number of people claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, income  support and incapacity benefit has risen steadily in recent months. Current  forecasts indicate that the situation will continue for the foreseeable future.  During this time of economic uncertainty and hardship, people do not need such  upheaval in the jobs and benefits offices. Although I appreciate that resources  and staffing levels have been increased to cope with the rise in demand, such  upheaval is unnecessary.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The use of customer access phones has proven unworkable in Britain and  many Jobcentre Plus offices have removed them altogether. The removal of 850  staff from front line local offices to centralised sites will take jobs away  from towns that are already socially and economically deprived. That goes in  the opposite direction to George Bain&rsquo;s report, which identified Omagh as an  important location for the retention and expansion of public-sector jobs.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the specific proposals for Omagh will  retain the social fund administration function but jettison the income support  function to Derry and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to Enniskillen, with a net loss of  19 posts &mdash; from 80 to 61 &mdash; in Omagh. Many staff co-signed a letter to the  Minister on 16 December stating their concerns. Many contributors were women  who reported facing lengthy travel on poor roads to reach work. They said that  the arrangements do not contribute to a good work/life balance and outlined  that the necessary childcare arrangements are not in place.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The review is just so ill-conceived that I must take this  opportunity to call on the Minister for Social Development to shelve completely  the strategic business review of jobs in benefits offices. I call formally on  the Minister to do exactly that, to do it immediately, and without delay.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It has been said to me that, at best, the review is  ill-conceived &mdash; particularly at this time it is having a hugely disruptive  effect on the whole benefits system &mdash; and at worst it is unwise and  irresponsible. I understand that Pat Doherty MP has also written to the  Minister, and he has met with her to raise questions about equality impact  assessments and how the absence of those impacts on workers in places such as  Omagh and Strabane. People who work in jobs and benefits offices have  emphasised to me the impact that it will have on their work-life balance,  involving extra travelling time, and so on.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">More than anything else, the issue is about the quality of  service to the customer. The priority should be to retain and secure a quality,  accessible benefits service for people, and to secure current satisfactory  working arrangements for the valuable public-sector workers who carry out those  administrative functions. The review is really about staff efficiencies; it is  not about improving accessibility for applicants, or delivering a better  service for customers. I am aware that there is considerable opposition to the  strategic business review of the jobs and benefits office inside the Minister&rsquo;s  own party. I noted in the Order Paper and the other documents that are provided  by the Business Office that her party colleague MLAs in other constituencies  have also been trying to raise this issue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I call on the Minister for Social Development not to delay,  not to pursue this foolish path, and to set aside immediately the strategic  business review, which is not about caring for customers, but is really about  management and staff efficiencies.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I support the Adjournment topic. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that you have said  that we have five minutes to speak, but if I run over that time, I trust that  you will give me a little leeway, as this is a very important issue for Omagh,  and I would like the time to put forward the case. I thank the Business Office  for ensuring that this important matter was brought to the Floor of the House,  and also thank the Minister for being present for the debate. I hope that she  will give due consideration to the concerns raised during the course of the  debate and act upon them appropriately.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The strategic business review was initiated by the Social  Security Agency in 2006, followed by the launch of a public consultation on 27  November 2008, which is due to close on Thursday 29 Jan 2009. That consultation  includes proposals that, if carried through to fruition, will have devastating  consequences for staff, for jobs, and most of all for the services continually  provided in the Omagh jobs and benefits office to the most vulnerable in the  community.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although I am aware that the issue affects every  constituency, I want to focus specifically on Omagh this evening. I will deal  with three individual points &mdash; the staff, the jobs and the services. First, let  us examine how the staff will be affected. The Omagh jobs and benefits office  currently deals with the social fund, income support and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance,  and over the past 20 years has provided such an excellent level of service that  the chief executive of the SSA has provided reports to the Minister, not only  of targets being met, but of the excellent progress that has been made by the  staff.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I commend those staff who, through their continual  commitment, often while working with staff shortages, still deliver a  first-class service for the community that should make any Department proud.  However, the current proposals, which seek to relocate income support to the  Foyle office in Londonderry, and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to the Enniskillen  office, will mean that some staff will have a daily round trip in excess of 100  miles and others will have a daily round trip of 70 miles.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The knock-on consequences for staff who have commitments &mdash;  such as taking their children to school or nursery &mdash; will effectively render it  impossible for them to continue in their jobs if they are forced to relocate to  Londonderry or Enniskillen.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Long travelling distances will also result in longer  working days that will, in turn, affect the health of the staff. Their  performance in work is likely to suffer because they will be stressed and tired  as a direct result of the added travel and longer days away from home. I ask  the Minister whether it makes sense for people to travel from Omagh to  Londonderry while other people pass them as they travel from Londonderry  to Omagh to work in offices. I cannot see the sense or the logic behind that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In one of the local papers, the Minister said that the  relocation of jobs would be within reasonable travelling distances. It takes  one hour to travel from Omagh to Londonderry  on a good day when there is not much traffic, and it can take one and a half  hours when there is a lot of traffic or bad weather. Is that reasonable  travelling time? Perhaps the Minister should come to West Tyrone and make those  journeys. She may then begin to understand what the staff would face if the  proposals become reality.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Let us examine the job situation. Under the Minister&rsquo;s  proposals, those jobs are to be centralised. That is in complete contradiction  to the Bain Report, which encouraged decentralisation. Where do the Minister&rsquo;s  proposals fit into the Bain recommendations? I remind her that the regional  development strategy identified Omagh as a main hub. It is the key town in the  west, with a population of some 50,000 within a wider travel-to-work catchment  of some 300,000 people.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A key feature of Omagh&rsquo;s economy has been the strength of  its service sector, with 78% employment and over 50% of its workforce employed  in the public sector. It also has significant development potential for office  accommodation, which could be easily adapted for the decentralisation of  central and Government jobs.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I was delighted to hear the announcement from TEREX Finlay  this morning regarding the future of the Omagh plant. In the midst of today&rsquo;s  uncertain economic climate, that company has taken steps to consolidate the  position of its equipment with no planned redundancies. It has identified Omagh  as a centre of excellence, and it has done what it could to make sure that it  could remain there. However, rather than consolidating its position in Omagh,  the Department for Social Development plans to wreak havoc in a service that  delivers for the people, with the potential of job losses from the Omagh  office, while completely ignoring the Bain Review, the regional development  strategy and Workplace 2010.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Let us examine the service that is provided. What impact  will the Minister&rsquo;s proposals have on the people who use the jobs and benefits  office in Omagh? The impact on the public will be a severe reduction in the  current service provision, as face-to-face contact will no longer be available  on a walk-in basis. It will be by appointment only, which may not be available  for weeks. Although there is much talk of a telephone system, the majority of  people who require that service are elderly or are disabled in some way, which  renders any telephone system inadequate to deal with the difficulties that they  face on a daily basis. From talking to constituents who require face-to-face  meetings with staff to resolve their difficulties, I know that no telephone  system &mdash; irrespective of how good it may be &mdash; could compensate for such meetings.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Should the Minister refuse to listen and set aside her current  proposals, she will do a great injustice to the most vulnerable people in the  West Tyrone community who will, without doubt, suffer the consequences as a  result.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">7.00 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The consultation document is crystal clear. The review is  not, as claimed, about delivering better services to customers; it is about  staff efficiencies, which will be achieved through the centralisation of  back-room staff, and that will deliver a severe blow to service-delivery  standards. Therefore, I urge the Minister to review her decision and to ensure  that vital public services, and adequate staffing levels, are retained in  Omagh, so that a strong network can be provided to meet the needs of  communities not only in Omagh but throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for your leeway.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I assure other Members that they will be afforded the same leeway  &mdash; eight minutes in which to speak &mdash; because fewer Members will speak than was  envisaged at the beginning of the debate.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Although I will put forward my case, I do not expect to require the extra  leeway.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Job redevelopment &mdash; as I describe the process &mdash; is ongoing  throughout the Province, so we are now thankful for public-sector jobs. In an  economic downturn, particularly with respect to the construction industry and  other sectors that are affecting employment levels in the west of the Province,  public-sector jobs are vital. Omagh has one of the highest proportions of  public-sector jobs outside the greater Belfast  area.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A sea change appears to be taking place in Departments and  agencies, which are moving away from affording customers &mdash; the public &mdash; front  line, face-to-face access. The further that process continues, the more difficult  it will be for people to access the services that they require. I am hugely  concerned about the increasing reliance on telephones, email and, to some  extent, the Post Office to access services. Those methods of communication do  not have the same impact as face-to-face contact. Moreover, it is difficult for  the most vulnerable people in society &mdash; the elderly, the disabled and people  looking for work, who make so much use of public-sector services &mdash; to access  services or get the information that they need.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Today, the Social Security Service issued a statement  referring to that situation:</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;Under the strategic business review, telephone arrangements  to meet customers&rsquo; needs will be enhanced and modernised to the latest industry  standards.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It should have used the word &ldquo;tele-phoney&rdquo;, because, having  attempted to access Government agencies and Departments, I know that it can be  an absolute nightmare &mdash; press 1 for this, 2 for that, and 28 for something  else. One must spend half an hour on the phone before reaching the person whom  you want to talk to. Indeed, the new planning regime has adopted that system.  However, out of respect for the flexibility that Mr Deputy Speaker has shown  Members, I will not digress from the subject any further.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Customers in Omagh, like those in other parts of the  Province, require face-to-face access. Therefore, I ask the Minister to review  the provision of services. I want jobs to be decentralised to Omagh, Coleraine,  Enniskillen and elsewhere, and that can be achieved by maintaining front-line  services in the Social Security Agency and in other bodies, such as the Housing  Executive.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs McGill: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. This serious issue also affects Strabane, where I come from, so,  although the Adjournment debate concerns services in Omagh, I support the  motion. Given the hour, and the fact that it has been a long day, I appreciate  the Minister&rsquo;s presence in the House.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to highlight the situation in Strabane. The general  view is that the economic downturn has created a context in Strabane, where  there is already a very low base.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I know that you have allowed some leeway, Mr Deputy  Speaker, with regard to comments about other areas, and I will get on to the  general topic. However, I want to put on record the situation in Strabane. It  was raised yesterday by the MP for the area, Pat Doherty, and Councillor  Michaela Boyle and Colman McCrossan, who deal with such issues in the  constituency office daily.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Some 43 jobs in Strabane will be reduced to 10, and I want  to put on record my concern about that. The Minister has a listening ear, and I  want her to remember that statistic when we talk generally about the issue in  Omagh, West Tyrone and elsewhere.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Elliott mentioned the new &ldquo;tele-phoney&rdquo; system &mdash; that  was very apt. I do not know how it is going to work. Automated call  distribution &mdash; will this work? The experience of ringing a call centre is  exactly as Mr Elliott described &mdash; press 1, and so on. There are some tunes that  I know by heart, from ringing particular organisations.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want that to happen in this instance, particularly  as it will involve the most vulnerable in society, as has been said. It is  those people who need to have face-to-face contact. One Member mentioned the  importance of face-to-face contact; I think that it is a necessity. This  morning, I spoke to my party colleague Mickey Brady about the issue. We were  not talking about Strabane or Omagh specifically, but he said that there was no  way that employment and support allowances could be resolved satisfactorily  across phone lines. Applicants cannot be told how to fill in the forms over the  phone. He has experience of this, and I would like the Minister to respond to  that concern.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I was surprised to read that feedback from the Social  Security Agency front line staff showed that most enquiries could be dealt with  by phone. I am challenging that; that is not what we hear in our constituency  offices &mdash; that most of the enquiries from the most vulnerable people in  society, such as the elderly, the poor and people on low incomes, who need  face-to-face contact, can be dealt with by phone. I was very surprised by that.  I hope that I have quoted it correctly; I think that it came from a  fit-for-purpose survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Social Security  Agency front line staff said that most of the enquiries that they receive could  be dealt with on the phone. That is not the information that we hear in our  constituency offices.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has been in Strabane, in my constituency, a  number of times. I hope that she thinks of West Tyrone, and of Strabane in  particular. Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: I welcome today&rsquo;s Adjournment debate. I  thank the Member who proposed it and those who have participated. Although the  subject of the debate is Omagh, where, I think, Mr McElduff&rsquo;s concerns are  exaggerated, it allows me to put the Social Security Agency&rsquo;s strategic  business review proposals into some perspective.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The publication of the proposals has generated a great deal  of interest, but I am concerned about the amount of misinformation that has  been circulated. Some people who are opposed to any change in the structures of  the Social Security Agency have made claims about the proposals which range  from wild speculation to simple untruths.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is regrettable that much of the misinformation has come  from the party that introduced the Adjournment debate, and I shall return to  that point.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My aim is to ensure that the consultation is informed by  balanced and measured discussions. Let me make it clear: no decisions have been  taken, or will be taken, until we have had time to give full consideration to  the responses to the consultation exercise. Incidentally, the consultation is  still open, and Mr McElduff referred to the fact that it will remain open until  Thursday 29 January. I appeal to everyone with views on the strategic business  review &mdash; including Members of the House &mdash; to participate in the consultation. I  repeat: no decisions have been taken.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Not only have no decisions been taken, but many of the  claims that have been made about the proposals are entirely spurious. Under the  agency&rsquo;s proposals, as they stand, there will be no office closures, no staff  redundancies and no reduction in customer services. Customers who are entitled  to benefits will continue to be serviced by their local office, and a walk-in,  face-to-face service will continue to be available. Anyone who says otherwise,  such as Martina Anderson MLA who stated that in one of today&rsquo;s newspapers, is  plainly wrong. However, plainly wrong is a regular experience for that Member.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The draft proposals do involve a significant amount of  staff movement. I am concerned about that, and I have heard the views of  Members here today. Of course, I do not wish to pre-empt anything that might  flow from the consultation. Nevertheless, I have been aware for some time, not  least from representations made by my party colleagues and fellow MLAs from  across the Chamber, that important issues are involved. The Member for  Fermanagh and South Tyrone Mr Tommy Gallagher told me this evening that he has  constituents in Enniskillen who work in Omagh.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At the SDLP annual conference last weekend, I stated:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I do not find acceptable a situation where hundreds  of people will have to travel long distances to a new place of employment,  particularly staff in part-time jobs or those on relatively low pay, or who  have childcare responsibilities, and I am also aware that now is not a good  time for major upheaval.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, the Social Security Agency cannot stand  still. The current social security structures in Northern Ireland are over 40 years  old. They are based on a service model that sees customers having to travel to  offices, regardless of circumstances. Many of the people it serves have told  the agency that if it were to introduce a free quality telephone service that  would allow them to do business from the comfort and privacy of their own  homes, that would be welcomed &mdash; and I take on board what Mrs McGill said.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At the same time, there is the desire for the existing  face-to-face service to continue to be available locally. I want to emphasise  the point that the package of modernisation proposals have been designed to  complement &mdash; not replace &mdash; the existing quality front line service to  customers. No existing front line services will be taken away as a consequence  of these proposals, nor will anyone be forced to use the telephone, wait for a  lengthy appointment, or deal with a call centre. They will be serviced by  agency staff experienced in social security benefits, with the resources to  resolve their enquiry. The real challenge is for the agency to deliver further  improvements to the customer experience.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members also spoke today about the potential loss of  service caused by change. I want to emphasise that there will be no loss of  service.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will turn now to the issue of jobs. No member of staff  will be made redundant. Indeed, just yesterday, I announced the recruitment of  an additional 150 staff for the Social Security Agency, and more will follow if  they are required.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs McGill raised the issue of the employment and support  allowance. I was concerned, because I knew that claimants could not get through  on the telephone. As a result, we have appointed additional staff to deal with  the high volume of telephone calls, and a large number of claims have already  been completed through the telephone system. As of today, I have instructed  officials to ensure that there is an MLA and MP hotline, as there is for other  benefits, to ensure that public representatives have direct access to senior  officials to resolve issues on employment and support allowance on behalf of  their constituents.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Elliott: There is an issue about cost savings, yet  the Minister said that there will be no reduction in staff. I am trying to  square the circle. Will the Minister clarify how we can ensure that there are  no staff reductions in front line services and save money at the same time?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister for Social Development: We are still in  the midst of a consultation &mdash; there are only proposals on the table, and no  decisions have been made. I am keen that there will be no diminution of service  to our constituents, who are the people who urgently require the services  provided by the Social Security Agency.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I must address a point that was made by one of Martina  Anderson&rsquo;s colleagues. In the latest weekly sideswipe at my Department, he said of the review:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It would create further levels of unemployment  reducing staff levels, with up to 490 job losses.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is totally wrong, but it is not surprising &mdash;  Sinn F&eacute;in really must move on from that type of thing.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am all too aware of the economic downturn and the need to  ensure sufficient staffing to address increased unemployment registers.  However, contrary to speculation, additional resources that were secured to  address the current economic position do not remove my desire to improve the  service. Central to the issue that we are discussing is the customer &mdash; the  ordinary person in the street or the townland who requires our services and who  should receive benefits if they are entitled to them.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members that the proposals are simply that &mdash;  proposals. They are out for public consultation. I will listen carefully to all  the views expressed and will not make any decisions until the consultation is complete. Mr McElduff  mentioned the need for an equality impact assessment: that will be carried  out. I gave Mr Doherty and his colleagues that assurance when I met them  yesterday. I have also outlined areas where I have concerns.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are shrill voices that make lots of noise but are  devoid of any appreciation of the facts. Those people call on me to suspend the  public consultation, but they will have to wait. The public shall have their  say, because that is their right. My Department and I will then do what is best  for the people who use the agency, for the agency itself and for those who work  in it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members raised many issues, most of which I addressed in my  speech. If I have not answered any of those issues fully, I will write to the  relevant Members.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 7.19 pm.</p>
