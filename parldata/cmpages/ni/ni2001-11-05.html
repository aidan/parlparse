                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that all Members received a draft
                Order Paper at the weekend and were advised that the draft was
                subject to approval by the Business Committee. That was not an
                absolute procedural requirement, but it seemed to me to be a
                proper way of dealing with matters. The Business Committee met
                at 9.30 am today and agreed the order of business and timings
                for today’s proceedings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been asked to rule on two matters. Mr
                Cedric Wilson asked me to look at Hansard in respect of a
                comment made by Mr Billy Hutchinson during the debate on 2
                November. I told him at the time that I had not heard the
                comment, but that I would check the Official Report. Hansard
                reads:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;You’ll never find me hiding behind
                anyone, you eejit, shut up.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the 1982-86 Assembly a Member raised a
                point of order and asked the Speaker at the time, Mr (later Sir)
                James Kilfedder, whether or not it was in order for a Member to
                &quot;act the eejit&quot;. The Speaker’s ruling was that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Member is not acting.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He did not, however, rule that the word
                &quot;eejit&quot; was unparliamentary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding the use of the words &quot;shut
                up&quot;, it might have been better if the Member, on a point of
                order, had asked if the Speaker would rule that the speech was
                repetitive or otherwise unwelcome to the Floor, rather than use
                those words. Although they are not unparliamentary, they are
                perhaps tactless.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second matter was raised by Mr Edwin
                Poots, regarding Mr John Kelly’s comment</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;What about the terrorists beside
                you?&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">when Mr Robert McCartney was speaking. I
                recall occasions when DUP Members have used similar terms about
                Sinn Féin/IRA, as they describe it. On those occasions, when
                they did not refer to specific Members and there was no legal
                indication that their comments were correct — if there were,
                that would be a different matter — I have ruled that it is not
                unparliamentary. Mr John Kelly did not refer to specific
                Members, although Mr Poots did. It seems to me therefore that
                this was also not unparliamentary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received a petition of concern:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;As provided by Standing Order 27 we,
                the undersigned, submit this petition of concern in resect of
                the business stipulated below: ‘Motion to Amend Standing
                Orders’.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have checked this and it appears to be in
                order. Members will recall that although the debate on such an
                issue may take place today, the vote cannot take place until
                tomorrow at the earliest. There is some uncertainty about this
                issue. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 states that a petition of
                concern is in order to facilitate a cross-community vote.
                Another good reason for a petition of concern, especially in a
                legislature that does not have a second Chamber, is that the
                Assembly has an opportunity to consider the matter overnight and
                to vote on it the following day. The petition of concern is not
                only in respect of the cross-community aspect of the
                legislation; it is also in respect of timing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received a second petition of concern:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;As provided by Standing Order 27 we,
                the undersigned, submit this petition of concern in respect of
                the business stipulated below: ‘Election of First Minister and
                Deputy First Minister’.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have checked this, and it seems to be in
                order. It is possible to proceed with the debates today on both
                these issues. The timings have been agreed by the Business
                Committee. However, I must ask the Assembly to resume tomorrow
                purely for the purpose of conducting the votes on those matters.
                Are Members content with that?</p>

                a public document which will be available from the Business
                Office later. The first signature on the petition of concern
                with regard to the motion to amend Standing Orders is that of
                the Rev Dr Ian RK Paisley. The lead signature on the other

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. You have
                asked leave of the House to determine whether the Assembly
                should meet tomorrow morning. Can you inform the House if it is
                at liberty to take that decision as the Secretary of State’s
                decision to allow the Assembly to sit today is at present
                subject to legal action? In making that decision today we should
                be certain that we are not acting contrary to a court decision
                that such a sitting may not be appropriate. On behalf of my
                party, I object to the suggestion that we should predetermine
                that the Assembly meet tomorrow. It may not be appropriate.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand a little of the Member’s
                concern, so I shall clarify the matter. His concern comes
                perhaps from a question of whether an election of a First
                Minister and a Deputy First Minister would be ultra vires, given
                that six weeks have passed. I would not be happy for a matter
                that I believed to be ultra vires to go on the Order Paper. That
                would not be proper. When I looked at the question my first
                thought was that it seemed uncertain that after six weeks it was
                possible for the Assembly to hold such an election. However,
                unlike some other distinguished Members of the House, I am not a
                lawyer so I did not presume to come to a conclusion on the
                matter without consulting senior counsel. That advice, which I
                proffer briefly to the House, was as follows.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The requirement is that there shall be an
                election within six weeks, and of course we have had an
                attempted election within the six weeks. We are not in default
                on that matter. Does it say that after six weeks there cannot be
                an election by the Assembly? It does not, so the question must
                be: would this be a reasonable interpretation? The Northern
                Ireland Act 1998 makes it clear that after six weeks the
                Secretary of State shall propose a date for an election. It does
                not say how long he has to propose a date. It may not be
                unreasonable for the Secretary of State to take a day or two to
                consult political parties about the matter and then to set a
                date. The Act states that the Secretary of State
                &quot;shall&quot; set a date. That in itself does not bring
                about the dissolution of the Assembly. It is Her Majesty by
                Order in Council who &quot;may&quot; take the advice of the
                Secretary of State. That is &quot;may&quot;, not
                &quot;shall&quot;. Often, when speaking of the sovereign, the
                term is couched as &quot;may&quot; because of the royal
                prerogative. Parliament had to take a view that the Secretary of
                State &quot;shall&quot; put forward a date, but Her Majesty
                &quot;may&quot; call a dissolution. That opens the possibility
                that the Secretary of State would propose a date for an
                election, but that Her Majesty would not call one. That would
                leave the Assembly without a First Minister and a Deputy First
                Minister for, from this point, 18 months. Would that have been a
                reasonable interpretation of the wishes of Parliament? It seems
                reasonable to assume that it would not. Therefore it is a wholly
                tenable proposition that an election of a First Minister and a
                Deputy First Minister by the Assembly may take place after the
                six weeks, but of course at a time when the Secretary of State
                may be proposing dissolution and Assembly elections.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having considered those matters, it seemed
                clear that it was not ultra vires for the matter to be included
                on the Order Paper and that it was reasonable to argue that the
                Assembly should have the right to elect a First Minister and a
                Deputy First Minister. I do not therefore accept the Member’s
                argument that it would be unreasonable for the Assembly to
                proceed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not a question of leave of the House.
                If leave of the House is not given, it is a question for the
                Business Committee, which will meet today. If the House gave its
                leave, that would make matters easier, but it is otherwise a
                matter for the Business Committee. I trust that I have clarified
                the matter.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. My first
                point concerns the commencement of this meeting at 10.30 am.
                Standing Order 10(2) states that a Monday sitting shall commence
                at 12.00 noon. I find it difficult to understand how that
                Standing Order can be varied as a result of calling a meeting at
                10.30 am, contrary to that Standing Order, to validate
                retrospectively the earlier starting time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, in regard to Mr Cedric Wilson’s
                point of order, it is clear from the Northern Ireland Act that
                on the expiry of the six-week period during which a First
                Minister and Deputy First Minister have not been elected, the
                Secretary of State has a mandatory — not a precatory — duty
                to propose a date for an election. He &quot;shall&quot; propose
                a date for an election; he does not appear to have any other
                option.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The matters that you, Mr Speaker, described
                as counter-arguments are contained in section 32(4), which reads</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;If the Secretary of State proposes a
                date under subsection (1) or (3), Her Majesty may by Order in
                Council —</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a) direct that the date of the poll for the
                election of the next Assembly shall, instead of being determined
                in accordance with section 31, be the date proposed;&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 31 deals with the expiration of the
                term of that Assembly, rather than an extraordinary situation
                such as occurs when the offices of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister become vacant and are not filled within
                six weeks. That section has nothing to do with the date on which
                the Secretary of State has a mandatory requirement to propose a
                date for elections. It relates only to the question of whether
                or not the sovereign decides to confirm that date. However, the
                Secretary of State must propose a date, regardless of whether
                the sovereign subsequently decides to accept it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member raised two points. First, on the
                question of Assembly sittings and whether a sitting at 10.30 am
                on a Monday is contrary to Standing Orders; Standing Order 10(2)
                states how sittings of the Assembly &quot;shall ordinarily be
                arranged&quot;. However, it also makes it clear that the
                Business Committee can respond to the exigencies of the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members of the Business Committee were
                contacted. The Member’s party is, by choice, not represented
                on the Business Committee, nor is the party of his Colleague, Mr
                Cedric Wilson. They would not therefore have been contacted. Not
                all the Committee members were content with the decision, but an
                overwhelming majority was. I nevertheless deemed it appropriate
                that the Business Committee meet at 9.30 this morning to make
                the matter clear. It met, and a vote was taken on the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On his second point, the Member adduces a
                legitimate legal argument, and I have no doubt that in another
                place those arguments will be thought through and debated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A court may choose to strike down the outcome
                of our proceedings. However, there is a wholly tenable legal
                argument that allows us to proceed in a proper and seemly
                fashion, and it seems to me that we should do so. I have one
                further point of order from Mr Roche.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. It is worth
                reinforcing what has already been said with respect to — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I am sorry, but it is not for Members
                to reinforce a point of order. If I have made a ruling on a
                matter, that is the ruling. If the Member has another point of
                order, he may, of course, put it, but he may not support
                robustly arguments against a ruling that I have made.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is another point of order.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We shall see.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point of order is that it is absolutely
                beyond dispute that there is a legal requirement if the Assembly
                fails to appoint a First Minister and a Deputy First Minister
                within six weeks. There is a legal requirement — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I fear that the Member has not been
                listening or perhaps has not understood the fine legal argument,
                but it is quite clear that I have made a ruling on the issue.
                Another ruling from another place may, of course, supersede us.
                If that should happen, the Assembly and I will be subject to the
                law. Unlike Westminster, we are a statutory body and subject to
                the law. I would not dream of suggesting otherwise.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Act one of
                the pantomime was on Friday; act two looks as if it will be
                rather short; and we await the entrance of the pantomime horse
                and the rider tomorrow in act three.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can you confirm, Mr Speaker, that the
                Business Committee only met this morning at 9.30 and that there
                was no meeting of the Business Committee before that meeting
                about this morning’s Assembly meeting at 10.30 am?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can you also confirm what you consider to be
                an appropriate time for requisite notice for meetings of the
                Assembly? Heretofore, it has been understood that there would be
                at least two working days’ notice — you have said that
                several times. Why has that been breached on this occasion?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I confirm that, although there were telephone
                conversations, there was no meeting. I am absolutely clear about
                that. However, Standing Orders do not stipulate that there must
                be a meeting — they say that sittings may be arranged. The
                Member is aware that sittings have often been so arranged. There
                may be Luddites who believe that virtual meetings may not be
                possible these days. Well, so be it. There is no doubt in my
                mind that what was done was entirely legitimate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member asked another question about the
                timely warning of meetings. There were those — and I do not
                think that it is any great secret — who felt that it would
                have been good to have had an earlier meeting. I strongly took
                the view, although some have chosen to interpret it differently,
                that it was not possible to conduct the business on today’s
                Order Paper before today. Some Members may think that there was
                insufficient notice; others would like to have moved more
                quickly. I have tried to maintain some degree of decorum in a
                difficult situation. I shall take one final point of order from
                Mr C Wilson.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Did you say
                that the House would reconvene to vote on this matter at 10.30
                am tomorrow by leave of the House? I take it that, as you had an
                objection to it, the matter will go before the Business
                Committee and you will not rule that the Assembly will meet
                tomorrow at 10.30 am before the meeting with the Business
                Committee.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has made clear his objection. The
                Business Committee will decide today. I shall recommend that the
                House meets at 10.30 tomorrow morning purely for the votes on
                the two issues. Do you have a further point of order, Dr

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must return the House to more prosaic
                matters. Later today, we shall have the take-note debate on the
                draft Budget, a matter that normally requires much attention
                from Members. Matters spanning the remit of all Committees will
                be raised. Consequently, I ask the House to extend today’s
                sitting beyond 6 o’clock, if necessary. I trust that there

                Committee, why is it not possible for the Business Committee to

                petitions of concern will not postpone the debates on the
                issues; the debates will take place today. The only question is
                the time of the votes on the issues, and they will take place

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not sure that the Assembly was convinced
                by the argument advanced by the proposer of the original motion.
                The motion might be tactical or contemptible, but it is not
                technical.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We covered much of this ground when Members
                sought to amend Standing Orders last Friday. Today, the ink is
                not even dry on that change, yet they are attempting to change
                it once again. They wrote the rules — the rulebook is in their
                handwriting — and decided the rules of engagement in this
                political process. When they were defeated even under their own
                rules, regulations and laws, they decided last Friday to change
                them. Having changed them, they found out that they still could
                not win, even by fixing the game. They decided to change it all
                again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is an unseemly spectacle when the Chief
                Whip of the Ulster Unionist Party is unable to muster an
                argument. He cannot marshal one single, coherent reason for the
                Assembly’s supporting this motion. He simply proposes it and
                resumes his seat. That shows that there is no substance behind
                his argument; it is purely to obtain an outcome. It is a
                Jesuitical necessity that the ends justify the means. That is
                the present proposal of the Ulster Unionist Party. It does not
                matter if its members have to drive their coach and horses
                through the Northern Ireland Act 1998 — they will do it. It
                does not matter if they have to drive their coach and horses
                through the Belfast Agreement — they will do that too, and
                they will certainly not stop when it comes to the Standing
                Orders of the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What did the leader of the Ulster Unionist
                Party tell us, only eight or nine days ago? He said it simply
                would not be credible if he were to find himself elected as
                First Minister on the back of a re-designation of the Women’s
                Coalition. A matter of days later, he went through the Lobbies
                of this Assembly to allow the Women’s Coalition to
                re-designate — even though it would not be credible. He then
                spent the rest of his morning twisting the arm of the Alliance
                Party to get it to do the same.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist Party is now proposing
                the mechanism for re-designation in the Assembly. It shows the
                unprincipled stand of that party that it is prepared, within a
                matter of 10 days, to do a complete about-turn on the issue.
                Perhaps it will swivel a few more times before the issue is
                finally decided.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I seem to remember the reason that the First
                Minister gave for his resignation. <i>[Interruption]</i>. He
                does not do justice to the dignity of his proposed office by
                shouting with red face from a sedentary position. He should
                contain himself and really should not get excited to the extent
                that he does.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the First Minister resigned, the Ulster
                Unionist Party made very clear the reasons for his resignation
                and the conditions he required before he would change his
                position. Those requirements have not been met. The Unionist
                community can find no confidence in the unspecified location
                where an unspecified event took place, when an unspecified
                number of weapons of an unspecified variety were put beyond use
                in an unspecified way. This is the kind of certainty that the
                leader of the Ulster Unionist Party was looking for before he
                would take back his resignation and seek to become First
                Minister again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Groping as much as he can to return to
                office, he is prepared to forget about the commitments he made
                to the people of Northern Ireland. He is prepared to turn on the
                words that he gave to the people of Northern Ireland a week ago,
                and he is prepared to reverse Standing Orders in order to do it.
                That is the credibility of the leader of the Ulster Unionist
                Party.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He said on radio this morning that he was not
                afraid of an election. Can anybody think of anybody who is
                trying more deeply and sincerely than the leader of the Ulster
                Unionist Party to avoid an election? If he thought for one
                minute that he had half a chance in the election, he would do
                the decent and honourable thing. He would say, &quot;I cannot
                get a majority in this Assembly; I am going to the people to see
                if I can get my majority.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the subject of unprincipled positions, let
                me turn to the person who says that he is part of the pantomime.
                He volunteered for the position of rear end of the pantomime
                horse, but he did not tell us who would be the front end and who
                would carry the nosebag. The leader of the Alliance Party takes
                that credible position, yet his principled stand on these
                matters is on record, as he made his party’s position very
                clear on Friday. That was a few days ago. It is said that a week
                is a long time in politics, but for the Alliance Party it takes
                even less. Only a few days ago, the leader of the Alliance
                Party, who cannot look anybody in the eye, said</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The candidate for First Minister wishes
                that to be a majority of ‘genuine’ Unionists, and he can
                rest assured that we will not disrupt his concerns in that
                regard. We will not ‘dress up for Halloween’ as one Member
                described it. We will allow him to seek his majority among
                genuine Unionists&quot;.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can see that in the space of a few days
                the leader of the Alliance Party will not only take part in that
                charade but will have the principal part, and he is prepared to
                dress up in Halloween clothes.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                rise on behalf of my party to support the motion. Much work was
                done over the weekend in order to arrange the motion and to
                overcome the remaining difficulties, and I am satisfied that the
                motion allows us to proceed in an appropriate fashion. The
                rejectionists and wreckers across in the corner thought that
                they had their day on Friday. Of course, they will continue with
                their attempts to stall, to delay and to frustrate the process,
                and that is what the petition of concern is about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They will not and cannot be allowed to
                succeed in their wrecking tactics, now or in the future. That is
                what the motion is about. Those people can only offer a return
                to the bad old days of the past. The pro- agreement parties —
                certainly those who worked over the weekend — wish to create a
                process of change, to re-establish the political institutions
                and to make sure that they fulfil the aspirations of the people
                who voted in the referendum across this island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to make sure that the institutions
                are bedded down, including the all-Ireland institutions, which
                have been disrupted and stalled for more than a year. Our
                mandate is to resolve the conflict, which is of long standing.
                It is our view that we have accomplished much, but we need to
                accomplish much more.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite the odds, and despite the tactics of
                the wreckers’ charter which we have heard so often,
                considerable progress has been made in recent years, and it is
                up to all of us to ensure that we continue with that progress.
                We have a collective mandate from the overwhelming majority of
                the electorate, not only in the Six Counties, but across the
                island: we will fulfil that mandate. We are here to attempt to
                bed down the political institutions and the process that spawned
                them in order to give everybody a brighter future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and reject the DUP’s

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate may appear remarkably similar,
                given the Standing Orders and the business in the Chamber.
                However, as we have seen, a small minority are hijacking the
                overall wish of the Assembly and the people of Northern Ireland
                that a First Minister and Deputy First Minister be elected and
                the institutions given stability. There is an issue about
                addressing the rule that allows that to happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that, on Friday, the
                Secretary of State and colleagues from other parties that
                support the agreement informally initiated the process of the
                review of strand one. The first item on the agenda will be to
                address the failure of the voting system, designed to protect
                minorities, to enable progress to be made. We cannot have a
                system that is designed to protect minorities allowing a tiny
                minority to hijack all progress. I welcome that interest — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

                rule on whether what a Member says is in order. I am happy to do
                that, but I can only do so if I hear what the Member says. That
                is becoming increasingly difficult. I ask the House to listen to
                what all Members have to say.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the review, and the participation
                of other parties in that review, because, as I said in my speech
                on Friday, we are not interested in simply tinkering with
                Standing Orders. We must address the fundamental problem that
                caused us to be back here this morning. That is what we are now
                proceeding to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that Ulster Unionist Party
                and SDLP Members have put their names to the motion, which will
                make an appropriate and temporary change to the Standing Order
                in the context of the review. I would have appreciated it if
                either party had been a little more enthusiastic than they have
                been in the Chamber this morning, but I welcome the fact that
                they have participated in that respect at least. It gives a
                degree of collectivity to the approach that we have sought. It
                continues the process that we sought to operate during the
                negotiations that led to the agreement. We made progress then
                only when parties worked collectively. There is now an option
                for us to continue to make progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that the stability of the
                institutions of Government rests on proceeding to elect a First
                Minister and a Deputy First Minister. The stability of Northern
                Ireland as an entity rests on that. Progress has been made in
                recent weeks, and we must continue to make that progress. I am
                not the least bit interested in the personal future of David
                Trimble and Mark Durkan; I am interested in the welfare of the
                people of Northern Ireland. I believe that this represents the
                best way forward. I support the motion.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is designed to effect the election
                of a First Minister and a Deputy First Minister, which, at this
                stage, is illegal under the requirements of section 16(8) and
                section 32(3) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. The motion also
                represents a debasement of politics in Northern Ireland. That is
                apparent from the wording of the motion, which requires us to
                understand Standing Order 3(8) in a certain way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The way it wants us to understand the reading
                of Standing Order 3 (8) exactly contradicts the existing content
                of Standing Order 3 (8). That is an intellectual somersault that
                reflects the emptiness of any coherent argument from those who
                are putting this forward and represents an absurd debasement of
                politics in Northern Ireland. The instrument driving this
                debasement is the Alliance Party. The point has been made by a
                previous Member that this is a party that is now splitting
                itself on the basis of its internal contradictions and lack of
                political principle.</p>
                <i>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The assumption behind this debasement of
                politics that we are witnessing this morning is that the
                objective of implementing the Belfast Agreement justifies using
                any means to achieve that objective. I point out to the members
                of the Ulster Unionist Party that it is a fundamental political
                miscalculation to use any means to implement the agreement. The
                miscalculation is that the pro-Unionist electorate is so willing
                to prostrate itself before a Government incorporating IRA/Sinn
                Féin representatives of the terrorism that was directed against
                the Unionist electorate that the Unionist community will accept
                whatever political skulduggery is required to put such a
                Government into operation. That is a fundamental political
                miscalculation that is being made by members of the Ulster
                Unionist Party. Even from their own prospective as pro-agreement
                members, the strategy is self-defeating. The very process of
                implementing the agreement is alienating, and continues to
                alienate, a growing majority of the Unionist electorate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Unionist electorate wants peace. We are a
                peace- loving people, but we do not want peace at the price of
                legitimising those who have terrorised us for 30 years. That is
                a price for peace that is too high for any self- regarding
                electorate to pay within a democracy, particularly at a time
                when the civilised world is saying that we should draw the line
                between terrorism and democracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally I address the self-interest of the
                UUP Members. The leadership of their party is set on
                implementing an agreement that is being rejected by their
                electorate. It does not require any great amount of intelligence
                to understand that their leadership is sowing the seeds of
                political self-destruction. Apart from any commitment to the
                principle of democracy, their own self-interest should dictate
                that they reject this course of action.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I heard Mr Trimble on the radio this morning
                discounting the possibility of a significant legal challenge
                against what is happening here today. I remind Ulster Unionist
                Members that on every issue relating to the legality of the
                implementation of the Belfast Agreement their leader has got it
                wrong. I appeal to them, in the interests of their party, and
                especially in the interests of democracy at a time when the
                entire civilised world is orientating itself towards drawing the
                line between terrorism and democracy, to fall into line and vote
                appropriately.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take this opportunity to express our
                concerns to the people of Birmingham over what happened at the
                weekend.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that other parties have the
                opportunity to follow the initiative that we took on Friday.
                Peter Robinson said here on Friday that our sole purpose for
                doing what we did was to protect the agreement. I am pleased
                that he said that, and I am glad that he has it on the record.
                He may note too that we asked for nothing in return: we did it
                solely to protect the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That people should be allowed to define
                themselves as they wish, and not have others decide that
                definition for them, is intrinsic to the agreement. People
                should have free choice in relation to their political
                aspirations and citizenship. We have always described ourselves
                as a cross-community party, not a party of the centre. We are a
                cross-community coalition supporting a cross- community
                coalition in Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What are this Government if they are not
                cross-community? What is so strange about being cross-community?

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement had something unique written
                into it — something that the DUP signed up to when its members
                became Ministers in the cross-community Government. These are
                good times, when people can finally accept that cross-community
                politics works. It is also very important to say that
                inclusivity works and that inclusivity counts. We have, once
                again, an opportunity to show that not just the big parties in
                the Executive count, but that the smaller parties in the
                Assembly also count. Otherwise, we would not be here today. It
                is good to see that we again have the opportunity to make our
                votes count. They counted on Friday when we re-designated as one
                Nationalist and one Unionist. <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said of those who went out gloating on
                Friday that their views are not what Northern Ireland wants to
                hear any more. Their days will be short. The people do not want
                to hear the voice of intransigence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have one other point to make. We too
                welcome a review. During the Weston Park talks and, indeed, when
                Senator Mitchell first came to consider a review of the
                agreement, we asked for the establishment of an implementation
                committee. We asked for it again on subsequent occasions. I am
                pleased that at times such as this it is recognised that an
                implementation committee should be established, so that when
                problems such as we are currently experiencing arise, those
                Members who are pro-agreement, and, indeed, those on the anti-
                agreement side, can come together to discuss them. That is what
                people are supposed to do in Government. In moving this country
                forward, we expect nothing less.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The atmosphere and ambience of the House has
                often oscillated between farce and pantomime. However, I never
                thought the time would come when its future would depend upon
                the decision of a self-confessed horse’s ass. That is exactly
                how Mr Ford described himself this morning on the radio. He has
                given an entirely new meaning to the aphorism &quot;leading from
                behind&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a more serious note, strand one of the
                Belfast Agreement provided a number of safeguards. One of those
                safeguards was that, in the election of a First Minister and a
                Deputy First Minister, each community would have to have a
                simple majority of those who had designated themselves either
                Nationalist or Unionist. That was specifically put in to
                guarantee the sort of cross-community support that Monica
                McWilliams has prattled on about. What she fails to realise is
                that the farce that was conducted on Friday, when the Women’s
                Coalition designated themselves as the transvestite party, is
                being taken further today by the verbal and political gymnastics
                of Mr Ford and his Colleagues. They have demonstrated that their
                proper place is not in the political arena but in the circus, as
                a gymnastic troupe, because they have violated the whole
                principle of the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford suggested that Mr Peter Robinson read
                out only selected quotes. However, what did Mr Ford read out? He
                talked on Friday about fundamental changes, but what is he now
                seeking to do? He is seeking to make a change so fundamental in
                the political description of members of his party that it will
                last for exactly seven days after which his members can revert
                to being Alliance Party members. If that is the sort of thing
                that in Mr Ford’s dictionary of political ideas and thoughts
                amounts to &quot;fundamental&quot;, the Assembly is doomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Friday Mr Ford declared that he would not
                be a Halloween Unionist, but on Monday he declares that he will
                be a Guy Fawkes Unionist. He will don his Unionist hat and
                posture as a Unionist. The public are not deceived. One very
                sensible but not politically acute member of the public has
                compared this to a football match at which when one side scores
                the winning goal the referee disallows it because the ball was
                not kicked from the player’s own half with his left foot. The
                referee then cancels the match and reschedules it for Monday
                when the losing team would have 14 players compared with the
                winning team’s eleven.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is how members of the public see the
                charade, the fraud, the defilement, distortion and disfigurement
                of the basic principles of democracy that are occurring in the
                Chamber today. They are not fooled. They do not believe that the
                ends justify the means. If the intention is to create
                institutions that are respected and accorded parity of esteem
                from both sides of the community, one cannot base them on the
                sort of despicable horse-trading that went on over the weekend.
                Members cannot continue to violate the rules that have been set
                by the Assembly and at the same time expect public regard and
                respect. Those sentiments will not be there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not a tactical manoeuvre as described
                by Mr J Wilson or by Mr Ford. It is a disgraceful piece of
                political shysterism, and I hope that it does not succeed.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyone looking at what is happening in the
                Assembly could view it as Mr McCartney has described it as
                political farce at which Members should be laughing. Those who
                value democracy here ought to be asking &quot;Does the Assembly
                have to go through these contortions and tear up the rule book
                to keep a party in power which no longer represents the Unionist
                community?&quot; Members are hearing a party admit that it no
                longer commands the respect of the community that it claims to
                represent. The Ulster Unionist Party has resorted to sordid
                tactics — tactics which, as Peter Robinson pointed out, it
                cannot even defend. The Ulster Unionist Party cannot give even
                two sentences of defence for those tactics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Instead, the Ulster Unionist Party is relying
                upon the Alliance Party to ride to its rescue — not on a white
                charger but on a pantomime horse, with the leader of the party
                at the back end. Members must look at what has happened today
                and at Mr Ford’s arguments. He says that Members from the
                Alliance Party are redesignating because the stability of the
                institutions is at risk, and he will not allow a small minority
                to hold this place to ransom.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is what has changed his mind. However,
                those arguments pertained on Friday when he said that he would
                not engage in this charade and he would not help out the Ulster
                Unionists. Nothing has changed. The only difference is that
                between Friday and today the back end of the horse has engaged
                in horse-trading. It will soon be seen what kind of bribe has
                been offered to him. Some of his little friends have come along
                with him. Mr McCartney said that the leader of the Alliance
                Party is leading from behind — and he is leading from behind.
                He did not become a Unionist. Eileen Bell is now a Unionist. On
                Friday in this pantomime Alliance Members were all crying in
                unison &quot;We are not Unionists. Oh no, we are not&quot;.
                However, today they are saying &quot;Oh yes, we are&quot;. I
                hear Seamus Close bleating from outside &quot;Oh no, I am
                not&quot;. Kieran McCarthy is probably saying through clenched
                teeth &quot;Oh yes, I am&quot;. We have a Kieran and a Sean

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to perpetuate the charade, the
                leader of the Alliance Party admitted to being a &quot;political
                ass&quot; this morning, the first time I have ever heard a party
                leader do so. Some would say that with his beard and his

                that is without precedent in any democratic and law-governed
                state. That position was taken by those who read the Belfast
                Agreement correctly and advised Mr Trimble and his Colleagues
                during the fateful weeks leading up to the signing of the
                agreement. Mr Trimble and his Colleagues have undermined the
                position of the Unionist community and endangered the Union
                itself. They have undermined the process of democracy and the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today we are witnessing the outworking of the

                outside at what is happening in the House today believes that it
                has anything remotely to do with democracy. Unionists who were
                elected to the Assembly to further the cause of the Union do not
                believe it either.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Mr John Taylor — although I cannot
                see him in the Chamber — that when he left the negotiations at
                Castle Buildings a short time before the Belfast Agreement was
                signed, he stated that he would not touch the agreement with a
                40-foot bargepole because it would bring about the destruction
                of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. However, he re-engaged. In the
                last election he told the electorate, just as the Ulster
                Unionist Party did, that he endorsed the Belfast Agreement
                because the UUP had saved the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble and his deputy, Mr Taylor, should
                hang their heads. I hope that they experienced some feelings of
                guilt yesterday as we witnessed the final destruction of a
                gallant force that stood between the ordinary decent Roman
                Catholic, Protestant, Nationalist and Unionist and the men of
                terror whom Sinn Féin/IRA represent here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our stance is honourable. Unfortunately, the
                Alliance Party has shifted from the position of honour that it
                held on Friday when it resisted moves to re-designate. On
                Friday, the Alliance Party opposed what was taking place, not as
                a pro-agreement or an anti-agreement Unionist party, but as a
                party that had assessed the situation and realised that its
                electorate would not be well represented through use of trickery
                and sleight of hand in order to elect Mr Trimble and MrDurkan.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The electorate should not lack heart because
                of today’s events. As has been pointed out, Mr Trimble can run
                but he cannot hide, even should, in the next day or two, the
                House move to re-establish an Executive that will include two
                members of a party that is inextricably linked to and that
                fronts a terrorist organisation. Mr Trimble has said since the
                signing of the agreement and the formation of the Executive that
                it is wrong to be in Government with a party that fronts a
                fully-armed terrorist organisation. Therefore, is it not equally
                wrong to be sit in an Executive with those who represent a
                partially, yet still well-equipped, terrorist organisation? As
                Mr Roche stated, Mr Blair and Mr Bush make lofty comments about
                taking a stand against terrorism across the globe. However, up
                close, it looks like it will be the people on this side of the
                House who will be denigrated by the press, by the church leaders
                and by the captains of industry who endorsed the agreement. I
                have no doubt that we shall be seen as the villains of the piece
                and presented as the wreckers — those who do not want the
                people of Northern Ireland to have peace, stability and
                reconciliation. I throw that allegation back in their faces. We
                are not playing some petty game in order to deprive Mr Trimble
                of his ministerial car and his office. Rather, we are determined
                not to have in the Northern Ireland Government those who front a
                organisation that terrorised the ordinary decent citizens of
                Northern Ireland for 30 long years. That is obscene and
                disgusting, and my party will do all that it can to prevent it.
                We may win or lose this round of the battle for democracy, but
                the battle will go on and on.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The normal format for a winding-up speech is
                that the arguments advanced on the opposite side of the House
                during the debate are demolished. I had no difficulty in
                demolishing the mover of the motion’s argument, because he did
                not make any. There followed an argument from IRA/Sinn Féin,
                the close friends of the Marxist drug dealers of Colombia. That
                party referred to anyone who wished to uphold Standing Orders
                and the law as wreckers. Of course, IRA/Sinn Féin has the
                Belfast Agreement wrapped around it as some form of purity that
                wipes away all its sins, whether those be the murders committed
                by its terrorist colleagues or the political chicanery in which
                it is involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had the embarrassing spectacle of the
                leader of the Alliance Party. He is not having much of a time
                since he assumed that role. I see that he is experiencing great
                difficulty; he squirms as he swallows large chunks of his own
                words only days after he uttered them. However, he had the
                audacity to argue that the Assembly cannot have a small minority
                frustrating the will of the rest. That &quot;small
                minority&quot; happens to represent the majority of Unionists in
                Northern Ireland. That is the &quot;small minority&quot; that he
                seeks to sweep aside.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He also referred to a &quot;tiny
                minority&quot;. That &quot;tiny minority&quot; is six times the
                size of his party. He is so puffed up with his own importance,
                and the belief that the Alliance Party has a pivotal role in the
                proceedings, that he refers to a group which is six times the
                size of his own organisation as being &quot;tiny&quot;. That
                shows the degree of importance that he attaches to his own
                position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Returning to the original proposition, what
                was the intention of the law, of the Belfast Agreement and of
                our Standing Orders in relation to designation? The purpose is
                clear — designation was to be a safeguard for both
                communities. If key decisions were taken, both communities had
                to be satisfied. The Belfast Agreement identified some key
                decisions where it was not enough to have 40% of Unionist or
                Nationalist support, but which required a majority of Unionist
                or Nationalist support. One of those key decisions was the
                election of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.
                The Alliance Party, the SDLP, the Ulster Unionists and their
                friends in Sinn Féin regarded that as being of such importance
                that — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I see that the leader of the Alliance Party
                is shaking his head. He is telling us that he does not agree
                with the Belfast Agreement, because that is what the Belfast
                Agreement says. Now he is saying that he does not agree with the
                Belfast Agreement. That shows how quickly he can change his
                position and that of his party.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They all signed up to the Belfast Agreement.
                They all believed in that aspect and accepted it. When it is put
                into form in the Standing Orders, they want a way to wriggle out
                of it. They no longer want it to require a majority of
                Unionists. Everybody knows the designation of individuals
                because of what they stand for at elections. That is a
                principled designation. If a Member stands as a Unionist, that
                is recognised as his designation. However, these people are not
                Unionist. The leader of the Alliance Party went on record at the
                weekend saying that he could not stomach being a Unionist or a
                Nationalist for more than 24 hours. That is the sheer hypocrisy
                of such a designation. Alliance Party Members are so sick of the
                whole process that they are prepared to tell the world &quot;We
                could not bear to be Unionists for more than 24 hours, but we
                will do it for this purpose.&quot; That is the Alliance Party’s
                principled stand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will give it one warning. If it has not
                learnt by now — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just listen to the warning; it is simple.
                Members of the Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP are the people
                that the leader of the Alliance Party is relying on. They are
                the people whom he expects to ante up in any review. That is the
                position that they are adopting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What did they say in this debate? Where were
                the words of reassurance from the Ulster Unionist Benches or
                from the SDLP? Does he think that their silence is accidental?
                Can he trust them to fulfil their obligations in any review?
                They will have already delivered by the time that that review
                comes around. The leader of the Alliance Party should know from

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this debate, and indeed on Friday, much
                comment has been made about principles and democracy. It has
                been implied that principles and democracy can be protected only
                by the immutability of the Standing Orders of this Chamber.
                Those who used that argument ignored the fact that Standing
                Orders were created and enforced by the Assembly itself,
                conforming where required to the statute that set up the
                Assembly and reflecting the good sense and intent of all
                Members. Correctly, Standing Orders also embody special
                safeguard provisions with regard to parallel consent and
                weighted majorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those safeguards are there. They have not
                been tampered with, and they cannot be tampered with, denied or
                amended without the work of others outside the Chamber. The
                motion makes no attempt to change those safeguards, which are
                there for Unionists and Nationalists alike. No debate or motion
                today changes that fact. I hope that the safeguard of parallel
                consent will apply eventually to the motion we are debating. The
                DUP, by its amendment, has indicated its clear understanding of
                how Standing Orders can be used. That is its entitlement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion concerns designation, not Standing
                Orders. Designation does not enjoy the same immutability —
                indeed, it would be odd if it did, because development and
                change could not be accommodated. Members would not be able to
                express their designation more fully or more precisely. The
                right to choose should not, and cannot, be expunged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Designation as Unionist or Nationalist has a
                relatively clear meaning. The designation &quot;Other&quot; is
                less clear. Those who freely choose to use that designation feel
                that their votes are less valuable than those of people who are
                designated Unionist or Nationalist. They feel that their votes
                are not equally counted and that their mandate is not equal to
                that of other Members. Their votes are not counted in
                cross-community votes in relation to the Nationalist or Unionist
                community, even on crucial issues that affect the very existence
                of this devolved institution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion enables that deficiency to be
                resolved temporarily until the matter can be examined more fully
                in the light of current experience. This can be achieved through
                a review of strand one of the Good Friday Agreement as provided
                for by paragraph 36. The Secretary of State has announced that
                such a review will commence on 19 November 2001. Until that
                review happens, I urge Members to accept that basic justice must
                be done to reflect democracy in the House, as expressed through
                the ballot box, and that the motion be carried.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been much abuse bandied about the
                House today concerning pantomimes and circuses. The DUP engaged
                in a series of vitriolic attacks on Members. Perhaps its
                wonderful circus act of riding two horses at once is competing
                with what it alleges is a pantomime. It takes the advantages of
                the Assembly and the benefits of office while trying to bring it
                down. Its other act is wearing a bit thin for public consumption
                — the mystery of the disappearing and reappearing Ministers.
                Watch that Cabinet very closely – a new face might come out of
                it before we finish today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us not talk about circuses and
                pantomimes. Let us talk about the reality of our purpose today.
                The DUP has consistently tried all types of manipulations in the
                House and elsewhere to frustrate the will of the people of
                Northern Ireland. That will not happen, because the expressed
                wish of those people is that the Assembly should continue.</p>

                Orders. As a petition of concern has been received in respect of
                the motion, I propose to leave both votes until a later time.

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. My
                information — and, of course, it is subject to confirmation
                — is that the Secretary of State’s counsel has declared that
                the Secretary of State intends to propose a date for an election
                after consultation with the parties. There are only two ways in
                which an election can be called. First, after the natural efflux
                of our term — four years, or whatever it may be — and,
                secondly, following the failure to elect a First Minister and a
                Deputy First Minister within the six-week deadline.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Secretary of State accepts that he is
                now under an obligation to propose a date for an election, it
                can be based only on an acknowledgement that the time for the
                election of a First Minister and a Deputy First Minister expired
                at midnight on Saturday. That being the case, to go through the
                pantomime of electing a First Minister and a Deputy First
                Minister, in circumstances where it cannot be valid, should at
                least prompt you, Mr Speaker, I suggest, before proceeding
                further, to seek some information as to the exact circumstances
                of this morning’s court proceedings.</p>

                am always willing to be persuaded, as are other Members.
                Therefore, perhaps you will indicate the nature of the
                information that you received that would demolish my argument. I

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no need for us to go through that.
                The situation is clear. The Secretary of State has said that he
                will propose a time. The Member may be trusting entirely in
                whether the Secretary of State will carry through on what he
                said; I do not place myself in any position in that regard. It
                will depend on whether there is a successful outcome to today’s
                proceedings. However, the Member’s remarks about the six-week
                deadline are manifestly wrong.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member may think not, but in that case,
                perhaps he should have gone to the court — perhaps he would
                have got a different outcome. The outcome of the court
                proceedings is quite clear: there is no injunction against our
                proceeding, it is perfectly legitimate for us to do so, and,
                therefore, we ought to proceed.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. The
                Democratic Unionist Party asked the court to consider, under
                section 32(3) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, whether the
                Secretary of State had a duty to call, or to propose a date for,
                an election. The idea behind that was clear — it was to force
                the hand of the Secretary of State to do what he is legally
                required to do. The Secretary of State’s counsel put on the
                court’s record that the Secretary of State recognises that he
                has a duty to propose a date for elections and that he will
                consult the parties about that. That makes it clear that the
                Secretary of State recognises that his legal responsibility
                comes after the six-week deadline has expired. If the six-week
                deadline, within which the Assembly had the opportunity to elect
                a First Minister and a Deputy First Minister, has passed, how
                can we possibly consider that item on the agenda?</p>

                the Members’ arguments, I think that they are mistaken. It is
                entirely for them, if they wish to challenge any outcome, to
                take it to court, and, if the court strikes it down, it strikes
                it down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I am not persuaded by the argument.
                I have received a note from my own counsel that it is perfectly

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reiterate many of the points that I made
                last week. However, I wish to add other points. I believe that
                the people of Northern Ireland want devolved Government to be
                given the opportunity to prove itself. At the beginning of the
                process we set out with two objectives in mind: to ensure that
                devolution was established and maintained; and, in order to
                sustain devolution, to ensure that all parts of the Belfast
                Agreement were operational. That meant that the decommissioning
                process would commence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many issues that were raised in the previous
                debate are again relevant. Cedric Wilson’s remarks drew
                attention to the fact that there are a variety of opinions on
                the fundamentals of the agreement. Both sides’ views are
                legitimate. I believe, and have maintained the belief within my
                own party, that one should not be demonised because one does not
                agree with the agreement any more than one should be demonised
                for supporting it. Those people who are morally indignant about
                certain things that are happening here should perhaps examine
                their own behaviour in the past three and a half years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, Democratic Unionists and others
                decided to abandon the talks that led to the Belfast Agreement.
                That was their decision. If a party walks out of a process
                before serious negotiations take place, it is inevitable that
                those negotiations will not bear that party’s stamp, nor will
                they include the, perhaps valuable, contributions of that party,
                which might have helped mould the debate. It comes as little or
                no surprise that it does not like the outcome of the talks —
                it does not like it because it was not present and was unable to
                influence it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP has had the bottle to attend 2,000
                Committee meetings. It has had the bottle to stay in office. The
                party said that it would rotate its Ministers. That rotation
                mechanism was designed to keep the seats warm for the current
                occupants of the two ministerial posts. The DUP’s tongues were
                hanging out to return to office. If the DUP is so opposed to
                what is happening in the Assembly, if it does not like the
                system, if it believes that the system is tarnished and
                inappropriate — well, nobody is forcing that party to be here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, the DUP talks vividly about the
                presence of Sinn Féin and about its opposition to that party.
                Those are perfectly legitimate points of view. However, some of
                those same people ensured that Sinn Féin represent Fermanagh
                and South Tyrone in Parliament.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can shout at one another and guffaw in the
                Chamber; we can point out the hypocrisies that abound. However,
                that disguises our main purpose, which is to try to provide good
                governance for the people of Northern Ireland. We wish to
                sustain an economy that will provide worthwhile work and a
                future for our young people, so that they will be able to remain
                here and avoid the emigration that so many generations have had
                to endure. We want to provide and improve health, education and
                housing services, and to address all the other social and
                economic problems from which our community suffers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must ask ourselves whether any of those
                areas would be improved by the reintroduction of direct rule
                Ministers to run the Province, or whether they would be better
                dealt with by this House. The vast majority of people,
                regardless of their views on the fundamentals of the agreement,
                believe that devolution is a better solution to our problems
                than the alternatives that have been in operation for 30 years.
                Direct rule did not bring peace or the lowest unemployment
                figures for generations. It did not, and will never, bring about
                the enforcment of the rule of law that we wish to see.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can absent ourselves if we like, but I
                suspect — and the evidence supports my argument — that,
                since we came here in 1998, no Member has rushed out of this
                Chamber. Everyone present then — bar the fatality of Mr Benson
                and the resignation of Mr Hume — is still here, despite the
                views expressed by some that they were so appalled at the
                prospects that they could not stomach it. They seem to be able
                to stomach it, and that is also the case at the end of every
                month.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should proceed to put in place the entire
                Administration. That would give us the opportunity to test and
                provide good government. It would also allow us to ensure that,
                against the background of the global economy before and since 11
                September, we can compete in a situation where every region of
                Europe and of the Western World is scrambling for a diminishing
                supply of inward investment. Some might not be bothered about
                that — I am, as is the average person in the street.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are the issues that matter to people,
                and the histrionics of the Chamber are secondary to the question
                of whether people have a career and an opportunity to live a
                decent, dignified life in peace, enabling them to get on with
                their work. Those are the things that, given the opportunity,
                this Assembly could deliver. People might try to shout me down,
                but I will ensure that as long as I have the opportunity I will
                say my piece, and I will not be shouted down. I commend the
                motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Mallon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Friday I described Sir Reg Empey as
                &quot;a fine young man&quot;. I have since been taken to task on
                the grounds that that comment might diminish his standing in the
                Assembly, his gravitas and his authority. He is a fine young
                man, and those who wish to define &quot;young&quot; can do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have three serious points to make. The
                first is that in this Chamber in 1973 I witnessed behaviour that
                I hoped would never be seen again in any elected Chamber. We had
                &quot;performances&quot; — and that is the only term that I
                could use — by many during those debates. I even saw
                fisticuffs in the Chamber at that time. I would have hoped that
                in the subsequent 30 years things might have changed. I believe
                that they have changed, and that underneath the bombast and the
                sotto voce contributions there is a recognition that what is
                happening here will last, that the entire community wants to be
                part of it, and that any ultimate stability will be based on
                politics. I do not want to see a return to the performances of
                1973.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know there are — and there will be —
                Members who find it impossible not to make snide remarks, and
                who regard themselves as the star of the show and a great comic
                act. However, we are not dealing with a comedy: we are varying
                between tragedy and farce. Tragedy exists on our streets, in our
                towns and in our homes, and we are not doing anything to resolve
                it; we are adding to it with the farce that is created in the
                House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My second point is a serious one. Since last
                week I have heard much debate on Standing Orders, voting methods
                and procedures contained in the legislation and in the
                agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the procedures are not deficient or
                at fault. Without intending any offence, I must say that the
                fault, when it comes to Standing Orders, the legislation and the
                voting requirements, lies in the number of Unionist parties. I
                may be wrong, but I have counted five Unionist parties. I may be
                one out — and I am not taking into account the halves that may
                well be added before the end of the week. That is what is at
                fault.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A fractious, divided Unionism is not capable
                of, or competent in, maximising the Good Friday Agreement. That
                is not the business of Nationalists or of others. It is the
                business of Unionism. There is a concern and a willingness
                inside and outside the House to help those in the political
                process who find themselves in that difficult position. There
                are those who will spurn it and scorn it. However, there comes a
                day for everyone when help and tolerance is needed, and nobody
                should forget that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many ways we have had an unseemly week and
                an unseemly weekend. I do not want to see the Assembly, the
                Executive and the political process being manipulated by anyone
                — not least by a Secretary of State. Our political process
                can, and must, stand on its feet without gimmickry,
                manipulation, and without people’s having to pull rabbits out
                of hats every week.</p>

                Members that we would leave when he rose in the House. Two

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are people who disagree with the so-called
                agreement entitled to come to the Assembly? It is interesting to
                note that all those to whom Mr Mallon referred back the
                agreement. Those on our streets, causing the mayhem and trouble,
                all back the agreement. Why then take it out on those who
                disagree? They continue to do what they told their electorate
                they would do. In other words, they come here and resist as hard
                as possible any effort to take us further towards unity with the
                Irish Republic.</p>

                still active on the ground, then the purposes of decommissioning

                my time ran out on Friday I was about to quote Christopher Logue
                on Apollinaire:</p>

                We might fall.<br>
                Come to the edge.<br>

                Come to the edge<br>

                and they flew……&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That sums up what is happening in the House
                today. We have seen the comedians at work this morning, and they
                have had a laugh at the expense of many Members. However, we
                shall have the last laugh. Before this week is out we will elect
                David Trimble as First Minister and Mark Durkan as Deputy First
                Minister. That will be quite an experience for us on the
                pro-agreement side. I hope that as a result of our efforts, and
                for the sake of our people and our children, this peace process
                will, at long last, fly. It is our duty and our responsibility
                to ensure that. I look forward to working with those Unionists
                who do want a Catholic about the place. I do not know them very
                well, but I have met them over the last 18 months in different
                situations. I say, without fear of contradiction, that there are
                decent people on the opposite side of the House who want to see
                Fenians and Catholics about the place and who are prepared to
                work with me to bring about the essential change that the Good
                Friday Agreement promised all our people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I look forward to working with the SDLP, the
                Women’s Coalition, the Alliance Party and the PUP. I also hope
                that at some time in the future the Democratic Unionist Party
                will recognise the need to be part of that change. The DUP is
                not there yet, but we can bring it there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened to people say that Peter
                Robinson and Nigel Dodds enjoy their Ministries, that they like
                the place and that they are quite content with everything. I do
                not believe that to be true. I believe, from witnessing its
                behaviour, that the sectarian wing of the Assembly is dedicated
                to the total collapse of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace
                process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the peace process about? It is about
                people, education, health services, culture, arts and leisure,
                the environment, finances, the economy, further and higher
                education and the education of little children. It is about
                making lives better. We are in this position today because we
                have made great advances in our process recently. People said
                that the DUP’s main aim was to bring about decommissioning and
                that nothing else in the process mattered. I believe that the
                decision taken by the leadership of IRA was the worst nightmare
                of the DUP and of those opposed to the search for progress and
                change on this island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our job is to ensure that the power-sharing
                arrangements continue. It is the duty of the pro-agreement
                parties this week to cross that vital Rubicon together. We have
                shown that we can work together and that we can create the new
                future that all our people want. That future includes
                power-sharing institutions, equality, justice, an end to
                domination, the demilitarisation of our society and the taking
                of all the guns — Irish and British — out of Irish politics.
                It is also about the all-Ireland institutions and moving forward
                to create the new future that we all crave. Go raibh míle maith

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I rise as leader of the Alliance Party, a
                party committed to the centre ground, to support the nominations
                of David Trimble and Mark Durkan to the posts of First Minister
                and Deputy First Minister. I need not repeat the comments
                expressed on Friday. Everyone knows where my party stands on the
                need for progress under the agreement and on the need for people
                to be seen to be working together and for a collective approach.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is absolutely clear from the reactions
                that I have received over the weekend that there is a huge will
                in the community to see the Assembly make progress and to see
                the election of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                to match the other Ministers who are in place and to match the
                workings of the Assembly and its Committees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people have told us over the last
                several years what they will and will not do. I am prepared to
                swallow my pride in certain respects. There are clear assurances
                that there are moves to resolve the difficulties that were
                demonstrated last Friday. I recognise that others have done what
                they previously said they would not do. I can remember when Sinn
                Féin spokesmen told us that the IRA would never decommission,
                and the IRA has decommissioned. Whether or not some people
                believe it, I believe that Gen de Chastelain is an honourable
                man, and his word is good enough for me. That is why we asked
                him to come — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are incapable of dealing with serious
                issues such as decommissioning. That is why we have had to ask
                for help from outside. It is time that we grew up and took on
                the responsibilities ourselves. That is why we must elect the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also conscious of all that Sinn Féin
                has meant to the DUP, or what the DUP would not do with Sinn
                Féin. However, every Member knows that we have rotating,
                hokey-cokey DUP Ministers playing a part alongside Sinn Féin
                Ministers and that DUP Members sit in Committees negotiating and
                talking with Sinn Féin Members. So, if we are going to talk
                about charades and pantomimes, let us remember that the DUP has
                made its efforts here a complete pantomime and charade for three
                years. If some of us must live with that for 24 hours, we shall
                because the greater good requires it. <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

                Durkan. As we shall not have an opportunity to debate the matter
                tomorrow, I want to bring these proceedings to a conclusion by
                appealing directly to the Ulster Unionist Members to examine
                their consciences between now and whenever the vote is taken.
                They should consider whether their loyalty is correctly placed
                and whether they should have more concern about loyalty to their
                party leader, which is normal in a party — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They should have consideration for their
                party. However, the priority for Ulster Unionist Members, when
                they consider this matter overnight, should be their country.
                They were charged, when they were elected, to defend Northern
                Ireland’s position as an integral part of the United Kingdom.
                There is no doubt that the decision of the House tomorrow will
                greatly affect the future of Northern Ireland as an integral
                part of the United Kingdom. They should disregard the final
                attempt that was made by Mr Trimble and those in the Ulster
                Unionist Party to coerce them into supporting his reappointment
                and therefore the reappointment of Mr Martin McGuinness and Ms
                de Brún, and the continuation of the Executive and the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members should consider the latest promise
                — because we have moved on to another piece of nonsense from
                Mr Trimble and his party. Mr Trimble told Ulster Unionist Party
                members and its executive — and no doubt he will tell the
                council when it meets — that all decommissioning will take
                place by February of next year. I am certain that if the Members
                on the Sinn Féin/IRA Benches were honest, they would tell Mr
                Trimble and the Ulster Unionist Party that there is no chance of
                any such thing happening.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble has misrepresented the facts. He
                tells the House that decommissioning will have to be completed
                because the Independent International Commission on
                Decommissioning is due to wind up its work in February. A review
                is to be held in February 2002 as that is normal procedure in
                United Kingdom legislation. That is not required in the Republic
                of Ireland. The British Government will review Gen de Chastelain’s
                position in February and will appoint it for another five years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a few months or a few years, the Ulster
                Unionist Party may be sitting in an Executive with a party that
                is inextricably linked to a terrorist organisation — a party
                that continues to hold weapons and a large arsenal. The
                violence, targeting and all the other activities in which it
                still engages will continue. Every member of the Ulster Unionist
                Party must consider that; they need not point the finger at Mr
                Trimble or at the party executive when that becomes apparent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist Party Members have a
                choice. In years to come, when their children or grandchildren
                ask them where they stood on the issue of putting Sinn Féin/IRA
                back into Government, it is to be hoped that they will be able
                to hold their heads high and say that, when the chips were down
                and the votes were counted, they took a stand, not for the
                Ulster Unionist Party but for Ulster and for Northern Ireland’s
                position in the United Kingdom. It is hoped that they will say
                that they took a stand for democracy, decency, and law and
                order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tomorrow’s vote, should the Ulster Unionist
                Party permit it to happen, will affect the future of Northern
                Ireland. Members are corrupting the democratic process and
                undermining the rule of law and order in Northern Ireland. The
                reappointment of Mr Trimble will underline Northern Ireland’s
                departure from democracy and from support for the rule of law.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I add to the debate my voice, my vote, the
                vote of my Assembly Colleague, Monica McWilliams, and the vote
                of the people who elected the Women’s Coalition so that it
                might participate in the election of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister. The Women’s Coalition’s ability to
                ensure that its votes counted in the election was only made
                possible by the initiative that it took on Friday to allow
                re-designation to have immediate effect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members know, the Women’s Coalition
                Members changed their designation — myself to Unionist and
                Monica McWilliams to Nationalist — to reflect directly the
                party’s cross-community nature. By its actions, the Women’s
                Coalition called into question the discriminatory nature of a
                system that does not take the votes of &quot;Others&quot; into
                account. The Women’s Coalition believes that every vote in the
                House should count in this crucial election, and it is pleased
                that on Friday it opened a door for others to follow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I wish to emphasise one point,
                perhaps to Mr Trimble himself. It has been said that the Ulster
                Unionist Party leader, the person who has been proposed as First
                Minister, should only receive genuine Unionist votes. I remind
                the House that David Trimble can only be elected by Unionist and
                Nationalist votes and that Mark Durkan can only be elected by
                Nationalist and Unionist votes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make this clear. We are voting for
                a slate that is neither one thing nor the other. It is both. We
                support cross-community coalition government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The election is about more than putting the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in place. It is
                about sustaining the institutions of the agreement. The DUP says
                that it will use every opportunity to bring down the agreement,
                including the use of ministerial &quot;musical chairs&quot;.
                That minority will use every procedural mechanism to usurp the
                will of the majority of people in Northern Ireland who voted for
                the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As demonstrated on Friday, the Women’s
                Coalition can use procedural measures in a more noble fashion in
                the pursuit of positive democratic advancement in recognition of
                the democratically expressed wish of the people of Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who challenge the election of David
                Trimble and Mark Durkan fail to recognise that the two largest
                parties should have the posts of First Minister and Deputy First
                Minister. There is no question about that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The anti-agreement parties speak
                nonsensically about legitimacy and motives for re-designation.
                Mr Mallon pointed out that we have seen schisms, party
                formations and individual and collective splits throughout the
                anti- agreement camp. The election is about getting ourselves
                out of a political limbo and back to the business of government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is possible because of new and exciting
                events in Northern Ireland politics. Parties have been standing
                separately behind the roadblock of decommissioning. That
                roadblock has been lifted. We must choose to walk through
                together or stand back alone.</p>

                Empey who, when the Brooke/Mayhew talks foundered upon the rock
                of SDLP intransigence, wept and said that for people like him,
                the sticky fingers on the levers of power had gone for a

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the man who proclaims the great
                successes of devolution. What are its great successes? The
                economy and unemployment figures were not dependent on anything
                that the Assembly did. We simply rolled forward on the benefits
                of a world economic cycle, which is now going the other way. Reg
                Empey and the Assembly are powerless to do anything about that.
                He tells us about the great benefits that the Assembly will
                bring to the Health Service. The Health Service is in a
                disastrous situation, worse than that which prevails in the rest
                of the United Kingdom. He tells us about education. Education
                was the one area of government that succeeded under Northern
                Ireland provisions when comprehensive provisions in the rest of
                the United Kingdom were having a disastrous effect on its
                education system. That will all go. Those are the benefits of
                the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Mallon tells us about the great changes
                that have occurred since 1973. Great changes indeed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We now have the political representatives of
                armed terrorists, Loyalist and Republican, in Government: that
                is a great change. He dismisses adherence to the procedures of
                government as unimportant. One of the greatest English jurists,
                Sir Henry Maine, said that:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Many of the most important and major

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rules were not laid down by
                anti-agreement Unionists; they were put into the Belfast
                Agreement by the pro-agreement parties and by the two sovereign
                Governments as a safeguard against a breach of the kind that is
                intended today. The rules were put there to ensure that the
                balance between Nationalist and Unionist opinion was preserved
                and that the form of government was truly cross-community.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The enlightened Jane Morrice talked about the
                discriminatory nature of the system. The system was put in place
                by the parties to the agreement as a safeguard provision. Now,
                because the system does not suit, it has suddenly become
                discriminatory. Safeguards are abandoned because they no longer
                suit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice also spoke about sustaining the
                institutions of the agreement, but she forgets that she tore up
                one of the most fundamental institutions of the agreement — a
                safeguard for ensuring that only a majority of Unionists and a
                majority of Nationalists could take certain decisions, including
                the election of the First Minister. She also talked about
                majorities. I understood that the difference between devolution
                in Northern Ireland and that in Scotland and Wales was that the
                latter had majority systems. We did not have a majority system;
                we had a cross-community system, based on securing a majority of
                Unionist votes and a majority of Nationalist votes. It was not
                intended that that would be defiled and distorted by
                transvestite Members and horses’ asses.</p>

                the basic principles of democratic procedure. The ends are being

                The Assembly is being turned into a laughing stock, and the man

                Budget announced on 25 September 2001 by the Minister of Finance
                and Personnel.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 25 September, the Minister of Finance and
                Personnel, Mr Durkan, presented the Executive’s draft Budget
                proposals for the financial year 2002-03, in accordance with
                section 64 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. In making his
                presentation, the Minister acknowledged that Departments suffer
                serious pressures and shortfalls. The Committee recognises that,
                in producing the draft Budget, difficult decisions had to be
                made to strike a balance between competing demands across
                Departments, of which there were plenty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that the Minister and the
                Executive devoted much thought and a considerable amount of
                arm-wrestling to allocating finite resources so as to obtain the
                maximum return and to support the Programme for Government.
                Members must ask whether the correct balance has been achieved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate will provide Members with an
                opportunity to comment on the priorities outlined in the draft
                Budget and to argue a case for any change to them. The Finance
                and Personnel Committee will be taking note of the issues raised
                by Members. It will reflect on those issues, together with
                written submissions from other Committees and produce a
                co-ordinated report on the draft Budget. On behalf of the
                Committee, I express appreciation for the timely and full
                responses that it received from every statutory Committee and
                from the Committee of the Centre. Those responses will be
                included in full in the report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget that we will finalise in December
                covers the second year of the 2000 spending review. There has
                been a relatively rapid growth in public spending since the
                comprehensive spending review of 1998. The departmental
                expenditure limits allocated by the Treasury show a rise of
                5·8% in public expenditure in the financial year 2002-03, which
                is about 3% above general inflation. The allocations build on
                the 5·5% real-term increase in the 2001-02 Budget. However,
                even with these increases to the departmental expenditure limits
                — which the Treasury has indicated we should not expect to
                continue after the 2002 spending review — it remains the case
                that most Departments are running to stand still.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister, when discussing the draft
                Budget, and indeed any matter relating to finance, referred to
                the Barnett formula. Many Members feel that much can be gained
                by renegotiating that formula. The Finance and Personnel
                Committee has questioned officials closely about its application
                to Northern Ireland. The Committee recognises that Barnett is
                often weak at reflecting the particular needs of Northern
                Ireland, following some years of underinvestment in
                infrastructure and transport and in the acute needs of the
                health and education sectors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although it would appear that Westminster
                accepts that the shortfalls in public services require
                fundamental review, and, at the Westminster level, significant
                additional resources are being allocated, there is no guarantee
                that any Barnett formula consequential for Northern Ireland will
                focus on the same priorities. I reiterate that it is a question
                of deciding what our priorities are in Northern Ireland. I trust
                that that will consume some of Members’ attention in this
                debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Finance and Personnel
                shares those concerns about the Barnett formula and wants to see
                Treasury allocations to Northern Ireland reflecting the needs of
                the people. The Committee recognises that there is some need for
                caution. It is not axiomatic that Barnett should be regarded as
                the root of all evil. The Finance Committee welcomes the
                Executive’s determination to address the Barnett issue and
                looks forward to an early report from the Minister on whatever
                progress is being made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee recently agreed that a research
                paper on Barnett that it commissioned should be made available
                on the Assembly Intranet. I urge Members who have an interest in
                the matter to have a look at that paper. The Barnett formula is
                by no means straightforward — it is surprisingly sophisticated
                in some of its manifestations. To inform a worthy debate on it
                and to drive any representations that are made to the Treasury,
                the more Members who get their heads around it, the better.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During last year’s debate on the draft
                Budget, Members raised concerns about the Budget timetable and
                the need to involve Statutory Committees at an early stage when
                departmental spending priorities were being considered. The
                Minister said that those concerns would be borne in mind for the
                current Budget cycle, which would be initiated and run in tandem
                with the drafting of the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Finance and Personnel
                recognises that the Executive have gone some way to meeting
                those concerns. This year’s timetable has certainly been
                better than last year — although that would not necessarily be
                difficult. On this occasion the Minister has brought the draft
                Budget to the Assembly at an earlier date, thereby giving the
                Committees an additional two weeks to scrutinise the
                departmental allocations. There is a general consensus that the
                extended timetable has proved valuable in allowing Committees,
                among all their other work, to plan and consider the details of
                the proposals for their Departments. There is also a feeling
                that it would not matter how early you started — you could
                always do with more time to consider those matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The publication for consultation of the
                Executive’s position report prior to the summer recess was
                also a recognition that Committees and the public need to be
                consulted on the Executive’s developing plans for the Budget
                and the Programme for Government. The preparation of, and
                consultation on, the report was, in effect, an additional stage
                in the Budget and Programme for Government consultation process.
                The Committee for Finance and Personnel found that useful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The position report provided the Committees
                with a focus and a starting point for the commencement of
                budgetary considerations. In future budgetary cycles, that stage
                will grow in importance as Committees have access to service
                development agreements, providing much more detail than is
                currently available to use as benchmarks against which to assess
                departmental plans and allocations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of us are just starting to focus on
                these public service agreements, but they will have an important
                role to play in enabling us to focus on whether there has been
                an increase or a decrease in efficiency of delivery within
                Departments. The Committee for Finance and Personnel welcomes
                these developments. However, the Committee remains concerned
                that further improvement in the process is necessary if
                Committees are to have sufficient and appropriate opportunities
                to contribute to the Budget process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It remains the case that the earlier a
                Committee starts looking at the Budget for the subsequent year,
                the more impact it is likely to have on the outcomes.
                Essentially, it is never too early to start. Committees are
                beginning to identify, as the Finance Committee has, that the
                Departments may not be keen on Committees starting early.
                Indeed, from their point of view, Departments have more chance
                of getting their proposals accepted if a Committee starts late.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members are now more familiar with the
                structures of the Departments that they scrutinise. I trust,
                therefore, that they can examine those matters further in
                advance and that they will be in a better position to drive the
                policies that are attached to the budgetary decisions.
                Nonetheless, I put on record my Committee’s generally positive
                reaction to the improvements in the budgetary cycle. The
                Minister should, however, note the intention of the Finance and
                Personnel Committee to pursue further improvements through its
                report on the draft Budget, which will soon be published.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Committees have expressed almost universal
                concern about the failure of Departments to consult them
                appropriately during the bidding round for the second tranche of
                the Executive programme funds. The allocations made to
                successful bids from the Executive programme funds represent a
                real increase in the Department’s spending allocation, both
                in-year and across the budget cycle. There is probably a greater
                impact — certainly a greater discretionary impact — from the
                Executive programme funds than is likely to derive from this
                Budget round.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, the timetable for the
                Executive programme funds bidding process did not, in the eyes
                of many Committees, deliver an opportunity to be fully involved,
                informed or even properly engaged in the process. Owing to the
                serious problems identified with the process, the Committee for
                Finance and Personnel decided to act on behalf of the other
                statutory Committees, and of the Committee of the Centre, and to
                raise their concerns with the Minister of Finance and Personnel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a consequence, on 19 October 2001 the
                Committee published a report co-ordinating its views with those
                of the other Committees. The report outlined the problems and
                detailed 16 substantial recommendations for the attention of the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel and of the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister, who share responsibility
                for managing the Executive programme funds bidding process. The
                Minister is considering the report and will return to the
                Committee shortly to discuss methods and suggestions for
                improvements to the process. I assure him that Members and
                Committees expect to see a substantial improvement in that area
                in the future. In that context, it is never too early to start
                focusing on the next Budget, and by the same token it would
                never be too early for Committees to start focusing on the next
                round of Executive programme funds. In any case, the general
                criteria and the allocations to those funds are already well
                laid out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not go into details of the Budget; my
                remarks are more general. However, I draw attention to one
                matter in the Department of Finance and Personnel. As well as
                conducting a thorough and strategic examination of the Executive
                programme funds, the Finance Committee took considerable pains
                to examine strategic issues in the Department of Finance and
                Personnel’s central finance group section — if you like, the
                engine room for the Budget and the Executive programme funds
                process. Our aim was to ensure that the resources available to
                this pivotal part of the Budget management process were
                appropriate to meet the Department’s objectives as set out in
                the Programme for Government. From the concerns expressed to us
                by senior departmental officials, it was clear that resources in
                that area have been stretched to meet challenging objectives. As
                a result, the Committee for Finance and Personnel agreed that
                effective management of the financial process is essential if
                the outcomes that we all desire are to be achieved. The
                Committee, therefore, has supported, and will continue to
                support, the allocation of extra resources to the central
                finance group in the Department of Finance and Personnel in
                order to secure those objectives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of today’s debate is to give
                Members the opportunity to raise their concerns, to support
                various provisions, to pose further questions and to probe the
                issues. It will enable the Committee for Finance and Personnel
                to listen to and note the issues raised, to inform its proposals
                and to advise the Minister accordingly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That concludes my remarks as the Deputy
                Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel; I now
                wish to make several personal ones.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whether public services are delivered in the
                most effective way has become a national issue, particularly
                since the last general election. A great deal of soul- searching
                is going on over that. An interesting question arises as to
                whether responsibility for any fundamental changes, such as in
                how the Health Service is operated, should be transferred from
                Westminster, letting the devolved Administrations decide whether
                they should adopt them or not. That may well be what Westminster
                expects to happen. It does not need to be done in that way. We
                should also consider whether there is scope for the devolved
                Administrations to take the lead in reviewing how some services
                are provided and whether there is scope within existing
                departmental expenditure limits to look at things in what could
                turn out to be a radical way. I toss that thought out for
                consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members, and in particular members of the
                Committee for Finance and Personnel, must always focus on the
                fact that we are dealing with taxpayers’ money. Those
                taxpayers come from throughout the United Kingdom, and it is
                important to ensure that they get value for money from the
                public services. The public service agreements and the service
                development agreements are new initiatives to assist in that.
                However, we must look at the administrative structure that
                surrounds how Departments exercise their different functions.
                Money is tighter than it was, and that should be a further
                stimulus to examine whether the administrative structures are
                appropriate or whether there is scope to pare them down and
                place more focus on outcomes and less on process. I trust that
                when Committees are scrutinising the work of their Departments,
                they will take account of those matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Taxpayers are becoming concerned about
                whether they get value for money from public services. If there
                is to be an increase in general taxation, to go with the
                considerable increases that have occurred in past years, albeit
                of a stealthy nature, taxpayers will become increasingly cynical
                and question the real value that comes from that extra taxation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I look forward to hearing the views of
                Members, and I welcome today’s opportunity to have an extended
                debate on the draft Budget.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity that the Committee
                for Finance and Personnel has given Members to take part in a
                wider debate on the draft Budget. There is much to be commended
                in its proposals. The Minister has shown insight and fairness in
                dealing with the difficult task of allocating funds to areas of
                need and social deprivation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have said before, it is easy to advocate
                change when in opposition, but it is not so easy when in
                Government. It is absurd to see the people who claim that they
                want change, and who are the most vocal about the Executive
                programme funds, resisting the mechanisms in the Budget for
                change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are all aware of the problems that many of
                the public services face, but rapid growth in that area is
                essential. At present, that growth still falls short of meeting
                expectations for service delivery, particularly in the health
                sector, where there is a serious deficit in funding for current
                needs, let alone increased future requirements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The promotion of interdepartmental
                co-ordination to deal with issues that affect people with
                disabilities is a positive measure for building a stronger, more
                concerted way to alleviate current difficulties and to promote
                the social inclusion of one of the most disadvantaged sections
                of our population. Our aim is to provide better access to
                services and facilities for people with disabilities and to give
                them better access to education and employment. I commend the
                Department of Education and the Department for Employment and
                Learning for addressing the issue in the draft Budget, because
                they are bringing people with disabilities into line with the
                rest of society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Budget contains a proposal to
                allocate an extra £20million for education in 2002-03. That
                represents an increase of 4·8% on last year’s allocation.
                However, is that funding enough to make a real impact,
                particularly on TSN? Many schools are still experiencing funding
                difficulties, and, to advance the review of post-primary
                education and the review of local management of schools (LMS)
                grants, adequate funding will be needed to implement real
                change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is commendable that the Executive have
                recognised the difficulties faced by the education sector and
                that they have prioritised those needs. However, a revision of
                the Barnett formula would be preferable to ensure a more
                equitable allocation of funding in line with England. However,
                there has not been a spending review in Westminster, and it
                seems that we still have to work within the constraints on our
                spending power.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about the effects of the
                proposed £2&nbsp;million cut in the local government resources
                grant. The consequences of that could leave less-well-off coun `cils
                in a serious situation with regard to services for local
                communities. We need all Departments to examine their spending
                patterns to ensure that those are relevant to the real needs of
                the communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our targets in the Programme for Government
                must be reviewed and examined regularly to enable us to turn
                them into realistically achievable objectives. However, we
                cannot do that without adequate funding in the first place. To
                achieve that goal, we must show support for the Minister of
                Finance and Personnel in his endeavours to secure greater levels
                of funding to benefit all our constituents.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for
                Agriculture and Rural Development (Rev Dr Ian Paisley):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Committee met the Minister on 12October to
                discuss the draft Budget and the draft Programme for Government.
                Members also agreed their formal response to the draft Budget
                during a meeting on 26October. They had the chance to consider a
                draft of the contribution that I will make to the House today,
                and no comments were received.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One issue with regard to the draft Budget
                concerns my Committee more than any other: no provision is made
                for the implementation of the findings of the vision group’s
                recently published report on the future of the agrifood
                industry. The Committee has not completed its own consideration
                of the report, and it will not agree with all of its
                recommendations. However, through the Assembly’s research
                services, the Committee has established that many areas could be
                described as compatible or consistent with recommendations
                already made by the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee
                in its inquiry reports.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 19 October, the Committee met some of the
                authors of the vision group report, who expressed disappointment
                that the original bid for money had not been met. One of the
                subgroup chairmen pointed to the group’s 208 recommendations
                and pleaded with the Committee to help secure the resources
                required to implement them. The Committee takes a similar line,
                pointing to its own two inquiries, which have resulted in four
                reports containing 73 recommendations. The vision group
                deliberated for more than a year, while the inquiries of the
                Agriculture and Rural Development Committee lasted a year and a
                half. If there is no finance available to implement at least a
                proportion of those well-thought-out proposals, then all our
                time has been wasted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive’s position report published
                in June 2001 asked Committees to concentrate on what will be
                achieved through Departments’ programmes rather than on bids.
                However, in this case the Committee cannot separate those two
                aspects. If new actions are not financed, there can be no new
                outcomes. At best, the agriculture industry will remain in the
                doldrums it has descended into in the past few years. At worst,
                it may not survive at all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development’s original bid was for £10 million per annum for
                implementation, but this bid seems to have been totally
                rejected. The Minister explained to the Committee that the
                proposed Budget settlement was a satisfactory outcome for the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. She went on to
                outline her intention to bid for Executive programme funds for
                the necessary resources for the vision report, which she
                described as being £10 million — in total, presumably.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee accepts that, for example, the
                new directions fund would be an appropriate source of funds for
                some of the actions proposed by the vision group and, indeed, by
                the Committee. There may also be scope for some reallocation of
                existing resources within the Department’s budget. In the face
                of massive change in the industry, it is inevitable and
                desirable that the Government’s approach must also change.
                However, it is not prudent to put all your eggs in the one
                basket. The Executive programme funds are limited, and there
                will be great pressures for access to them from all Departments.
                The Committee is concerned that the funds will not be able to
                satisfy the Department’s implementation demands. Members are
                therefore convinced that there should be some mainstream element
                in the Budget to fund those actions. I would like to hear the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel’s response to that theme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a clear commitment in the Programme
                for Government to implementing an action plan for the strategic
                development of the agrifood industry. If the Executive are
                genuine in this commitment to the people of rural Northern
                Ireland — which we welcome — they must underpin that
                commitment by providing adequate resources that must be firmly
                established in the Department’s budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will continue when I am called again after
                Question Time.</p>

                I am very encouraged by the Minister’s reply, and I thank him
                for it. I seek assurances for local councils that will invest
                considerable finance in the cruise initiative. I understand the
                Minister’s proposals to improve this. Can he assure local
                councils that are investing in the project so that they can
                assure local businesses that they will benefit from the spending
                of passengers who visit our cities through the cruise
                initiative?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is correct in saying that one of
                the key benefits — which we all hope for from this initiative
                — is that significant numbers of people who would otherwise
                not be visitors to Northern Ireland will come here. They will
                have an opportunity to visit various locations and will spend
                money in the areas where they shop or visit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ground handling agents are responsible for
                those visits, and they determine the itineraries on offer to
                passengers. This initiative, which is largely based around the
                Belfast and Londonderry conference, is only to get vessels into
                port. After that, the ground agents will offer various trips,
                which could comprise bus tours or walks into city centres.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Tourist Board supports attendance at the
                major international conference, which showcases the cruise line
                industry. This projects Northern Ireland ports and helps them to
                attract attention. It has enjoyed a degree of success.
                Unfortunately, there have been some setbacks since 11 September.
                Renaissance Cruises has gone into liquidation — a company that
                accounted for three or four visits to Belfast per annum.
                Londonderry has done well in recent years and is improving in
                this market. During this summer it has been clear that
                significant numbers of passengers can be brought in. I assure
                the Member that we hope to follow this up with a sales
                initiative later in the year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, events since September are working
                against us, as the Member will understand. I have no doubt that
                there is significant potential. I can confirm that we will link
                up with the western isles of Scotland. Our tourist office in
                Glasgow is discussing opportunities with Cruise Scotland Ltd for
                joint marketing and a possible joint Northern Ireland/Scotland
                initiative to ensure that cruise ships visit both destinations.
                We are also working with Cruise Ireland. We hope to cover as
                many bases as possible.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My views on that are well known. It is
                important to have the capacity to protect the long-term future
                of this and other companies. Some sectors have been under severe
                pressure in recent months, and those that have a significant
                research and development capability are the more stable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Trades unions asked about design capability,
                and Bombardier assured my Department, not for the first time,
                that it remains fully committed. We are watching that closely,
                and we can tailor the letters of offer that the Industrial
                Development Board (IDB) makes to companies such as Bombardier to
                encourage that kind of development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure the Member that I am satisfied with
                the replies I have received, but vigilance and care are needed
                to ensure that the potential for development is not lost,
                because that is the key to the long-term security of the
                manufacturing facility.</p>

                from the excellent work done by his Department at the B/E
                Aerospace plant in Kilkeel, does the Minister accept that if
                Bombardier Shorts has a choice between downgrading a plant here
                and one in the States it is possible, with a high degree of
                support from the Department and the IDB and a good productivity
                rate, to retain the plant in Northern Ireland and save jobs?
                Shorts’ productivity in Northern Ireland is good, so that can
                be argued successfully.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is correct. Nortel announced that
                it is to cease manufacturing operations in County Galway and
                that it will move production to Monkstown, because there is a
                substantial research and development department of nearly 500
                people. In the case of B/E Aerospace, I should put on record my
                appreciation of the help I received from several South Down
                representatives in that difficult situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Quality, expertise and being at the leading
                edge of production give the best security for the future, and it
                was the deciding factor in the two examples that we witnessed
                when confronted with potential job loss. I have no doubt
                therefore that it is the same for Bombardier Shorts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren and I have recognised that the
                ability to provide the right mix of skills at the leading edge
                of industry is necessary in the long term to protect jobs and to
                prevent plant closures, which were a feature of life in the
                1970s. Northern Ireland gained much in the 1960s and lost it
                again in the 1970s, when we had a branch economy where factories
                were closed down. I agree wholeheartedly with the Member.</p>
                <b>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister told us that at present design
                facility and design work at Bombardier Shorts are guaranteed.
                Has he had any direct contact with the Bombardier Shorts
                management in Montreal? Is it possible to establish whether
                there is any further downside potential?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sadly, one announcement of job losses may
                soon be followed by others. While I accept what the Minister has
                said — and I do not want to be negative — I am, however, a
                little worried that six weeks or two or three months down the
                line, gloom could set in again and the position could be
                reversed.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I share a certain degree of the Member’s
                anxiety. I have had contact with Montreal- based senior
                management. I intend to visit the company there in the near
                future. I have taken those points up with the company. My
                concerns were dismissed as wholly unfounded, and I was assured
                that there was no intention to reduce the Belfast plant’s
                design and engineering capability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we all know that any business today
                is only as good as its last order. We all know that events can
                completely change estimates. Unforeseen circumstances can arise,
                as has happened in the last couple of months. Having said that,
                we have tested the company to the best of our ability. The
                company knows that we are helping it in processes and
                transactions that are focused. We are encouraging investment in
                that capability by profiling the assistance that we give to the
                company. In so far as I have sought guarantees, I have received
                them, but we must all understand that they are always subject to
                external issues. The Member will understand that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although it is rather breaking with
                precedent, I shall, given that Mr Wells has already asked a
                question on behalf of his party, let Mr Shannon break with it
                because we shall probably have some time left.</p>
                <b>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you for breaking with precedent. Can
                the Minister confirm that 619 people were employed in the design
                team in Bombardier Shorts in 1997 but that that number has been
                reduced to 368 in 2001 as a result of the 40 job losses in that
                area? That is at a time when the workforce at Bombardier Shorts
                has risen to perhaps its highest level for years. I am concerned
                about the numbers in the design team, given the past staffing
                levels and the numbers now.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot confirm from personal knowledge
                those figures, but I accept the general thrust of what the
                Member said. I repeat that I have sought and received
                undertakings from the company. Regarding the precise methodology
                that a company with a design capability uses, the requirement
                for staff numbers may be linked in part to technology. The
                Member must understand that Shorts is an integrated operation
                with sites in different locations around the world. He must also
                understand that the company has been moving from the manufacture
                of aircraft to part manufacture of aircraft, so the processes
                and requirements are different.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I take seriously his main point that
                there are now fewer people carrying out that function. That does
                not necessarily mean that their output or capability is reduced
                by a similar amount. Senior officials in my Department are
                acutely aware of the situation; they are watching it and are
                contacting the company. We are in direct contact with the trades
                unions, and we have met the Confederation of Shipbuilding and
                Engineering Unions. Representatives from all the unions have
                spoken to the Department; we have discussed those matters with
                them; we are working closely together; and liaison arrangements
                have been established to ensure that the necessary information
                is flowing freely. I had a meeting with the company at the end
                of last week to pursue several issues with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am acutely aware of the importance,
                strategically and otherwise, of this company to the Northern
                Ireland economy, and my Department is being as vigilant and
                helpful to the company as it possibly can.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I raised the issue of Maydown Precision
                Engineering Ltd with Bombardier Shorts and with its
                representative from Montreal and I was assured that they would
                be doing everything possible to protect the company. However,
                they could not give guarantees in blood.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I got the strongest guarantee possible, and
                we are satisfied that the company understands the importance of
                Maydown. It understands the potential of the facility there for
                the long term, and, in fairness to Bombardier Shorts, it has
                stuck with Maydown and has developed skills and capacities
                there. I visited the plant last year to find that it has moved
                forward in leaps and bounds. Maydown’s problem is not with its
                work with Bombardier Shorts; it is with the work it used to have
                with Molins and the failure to get an adequate supply of parts
                manufacture undertaken. That is the major problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When a Minister is asked a question, the

                is exceptionally important and significant. It covers many
                issues that affect Mrs Courtney’s constituency. With her
                permission, I would prefer to send her the entire briefing in

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister accept that pressure on the
                petrol industry has led to a loss of jobs in border areas, and
                has he discussed a compensation package with the Minister of
                Finance and Personnel so that those areas are not disadvantaged?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member and other Colleagues have raised
                this issue with me several times. I am acutely aware of the
                numerous filling stations that have closed in the past 12 to 18
                months. The First Minister and the Deputy First Minister made
                personal representations to the Treasury earlier this year at a
                meeting with the Chancellor. We have never ceased to be in
                correspondence with the Financial Secretary to the Treasury
                about the consequences. We have pointed out the losses of
                revenue and that this sorry saga is financing a whole structure
                of paramilitary organisations, which can make huge profits. We
                are pointing out that petrol imports to Northern Ireland have
                fallen by 55% over the past few years while vehicle numbers have
                increased by 22%. We estimate that between £100 million and
                £200 million per annum has been lost to the Treasury.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We therefore believe that measures must be
                taken to deal effectively with this matter. I acknowledge that
                the Treasury has increased Customs and Excise activity, but this
                is clearly not working adequately. I am aware of genuine cases
                of hardship.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel and I
                explored what could be done. Issues of compensation have been
                raised. To equalise the cost of fuel between Northern Ireland
                and the Republic would cost the Government of Northern Ireland
                £0·25 billion pounds every year. It is just not possible.
                However, I notice that fuel prices are down in some areas to
                69·9p. I hope that those reductions continue and that the value
                of the euro will rise, giving us the opportunity to rid
                ourselves of this scourge once and for all.</p>

                did, however, submit a supplementary on job losses in the

                his question answered. I am very happy to answer any questions

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome what the Minister has said about
                the difficulties suffered by petrol retailers. So many petrol
                stations in the counties of Derry, Tyrone, Fermanagh and Armagh
                have been closed that many legitimate petrol station owners are
                asking when the Assembly will deliver some meaningful help to
                them. Many of these own family businesses, and those who have
                remained open want reassurance that we are doing something on
                their behalf.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member and other Colleagues from West
                Tyrone have made a sincere cry from the heart. I have received
                several deputations, as has my Colleague, Mr Durkan. To our
                frustration, this is a reserved matter. The Assembly does not
                have power over excise duties. That is a matter for Westminster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have made representations at the very
                highest level. The First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                went to see the Chancellor. Mr Durkan has been in touch with the
                Treasury, and my Department has written on numerous occasions. I
                have received delegations from the petrol retailers, and I have
                listened to the sincere and sorry stories that many have had to
                tell of how their livelihoods have been obliterated. The
                businesses that they built up over many years have disappeared
                before their very eyes. I sympathise with all the Members who
                are making representations on behalf of the petrol retailers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, as I have said, it is not a devolved
                matter. The Government must take us seriously when we point out
                that there is little value in having nominal excise duty limits
                when, in fact, the Treasury is losing money. More imagination
                must be shown in dealing with this matter. The smugglers who are
                illegally acquiring large sums of money and bleeding this
                industry to death are making the main gains.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If that were the responsibility of the House,
                I do not believe that Members would tolerate it for one moment.
                Sadly, it is not our responsibility. I hope that in the run-up
                to the next Budget, the Treasury will have listened to the
                representations that Mr Durkan and others have made and will try
                to end this scourge.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been asked to allow another
                supplementary question on this matter. No doubt the Member will
                realise that we have almost reached the end of the time
                allotted. Please be brief.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that the reason that
                many motorists travel to Monaghan or Donegal to buy fuel is the
                lower price there? Does he agree that there is an argument in
                support of the harmonisation of fuel prices at an all-Ireland
                level? Many MLAs of both political traditions queue up in
                Emyvale and Lifford to acquire petrol and diesel.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have little doubt that the Member is not
                one of them. I understand that many people take advantage of the
                price difference. The undervaluation of the euro is an issue,
                but as it becomes more realistically valued the price difference
                will disappear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Harmonisation can be achieved in other ways.
                The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment has tried to
                impress upon the Treasury that it is losing between £100
                million and £200 million a year, that there is a regional
                dimension to that and that the Treasury has previously
                acknowledged regional issues in, for example, tax on airfares.
                The Treasury recognised that a specific need for air travel
                existed in the highlands and islands of Scotland, and therefore
                it reduced taxation of passengers to and from that region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment is making the case that there is also a specific need
                here. However, there are two aspects to the matter. There is the
                legitimate person who drives across the border to fill up his
                vehicle — that is an economic decision. However, huge amounts
                of illegitimate activity are being spawned and are fuelling all
                sorts of campaigns. That cannot be tolerated. It requires action
                across the board, and it is hoped that the Treasury will move
                quickly to staunch the flow of revenue and to eliminate a
                substantial flow of funds to those who are making that money for
                nefarious purposes.</p>

                been in operation since the beginning of the current academic
                year. They have been taken forward by university-led consortia

                the leadership of universities from the design and planning

                Universities will award the foundation degree qualification.
                Employers will ensure that the programme matches current
                industrial needs. That will be achieved by the involvement of
                employers at the initial development and planning stage of

                be adjusted to the level of funding available. I have
                highlighted, as has the Programme for Government, the need to
                ensure that access for the disabled to training and educational
                facilities is such that they can fully avail of the
                opportunities and that their rights to do so are in no way
                inhibited by difficulties of access. There is a programme of
                work associated with that commitment, and ensuring that we can
                deliver on it as quickly as possible is very much determined by

                the needs of people with deficiencies in these skills. He will
                be aware that the Department for Employment and Learning is
                developing its strategic programme for literacy and numeracy.
                The essential skills unit of the Educational Guidance Service
                for Adults (EGSA) is undertaking considerable work, and I am
                endeavouring to ensure that an appropriate level of funding is
                available. As I told Dr Birnie, we do not always receive the
                amount that we bid for, but the Department for Employment and

                the common selection scheme is designed to ensure that all
                housing allocations match the needs of applicants. The scheme
                was introduced in November 2000, and this month the Housing

                there is great concern that the housing selection scheme has not
                dealt with the needs of this category of applicant. Will the
                Minister consult the Housing Executive on how the injustice
                should be redressed, and will the review deal with this?</p>

                that Members will make their views on the operation of the

                regularly consult the Housing Executive on various issues, and I
                will undoubtedly consult it on the common selection scheme and
                its evaluation. I encourage Members and anyone with an interest
                in the matter to make their views known to the Housing Executive

                matters that I raised with him. Does the Minister share local
                people’s and representatives’ concerns about allocation in
                the common selection scheme? They worry that it could be
                disruptive to an area with a good community spirit if
                troublemakers were allocated housing there. That was a concern

                views known, and my predecessor went on the record on the
                matter. At the moment, houses are allocated by a system of
                points allocation under various headings, but, again, I
                encourage the Member to make representations directly to the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Housing Executive has a duty to approve a
                grant application when a dwelling fails to meet the statutory
                fitness standard or must be adapted to meet the needs of a
                disabled occupant, regardless of the area in which the dwelling
                is situated. The scope for targeting deprived areas is therefore
                limited, and applications for grants are not categorised in that
                way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the beginning of the financial year to
                the end of September, 4,891 applications were approved, of which
                1,737 were for properties that failed to meet the fitness
                standard or required disabled adaptations. Smaller-scale schemes
                accounted for 1,300 approvals. The number of approvals is
                expected to rise to about 9,000 by the end of the financial
                year.</p>

                relatively deprived rural area, and schemes such as the
                private-sector grants scheme play an important part in improving
                the living conditions of my constituents. Will the Minister
                outline what future role he envisages for this scheme?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Successive house condition surveys confirm
                that the private-sector grants scheme plays a significant part
                in reducing housing unfitness. The most recent survey was
                carried out five years ago — it recorded housing unfitness of
                7·3%. It is anticipated that the results of the next survey,
                which we expect at about the end of 2002 or early in 2003, will
                confirm a reduction in those levels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A change has been proposed that would allow
                the Housing Executive more flexibility if better targeting is
                needed than that which is available from the present mandatory
                regime. A proposed discretionary scheme would help the Housing
                Executive to tackle social exclusion by supporting vulnerable
                people, improving the quality of the housing stock and by
                helping to ensure an adequate supply of housing to meet people’s
                needs, particularly those living in rural areas.</p>

                pressure of work on occupational therapists and occupational
                therapy departments in the health and hospital trusts. Would it
                not be sensible to consider having dedicated occupational

                of my Department; it falls within the remit of the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety. Attempts have been
                made to ensure that some adaptations can be made without a full
                occupational therapist’s report, so that the work can be

                with the residents’ association in Ballyhornan for the past
                two years to tackle the housing problems in the estate. I am
                aware of the difficulties in the Ballyhornan estate, many of
                which are unique to the estate — for example, the problems
                with regard to the roads and sewerage systems, which fall
                outside the remit of my Department.</p>
                <b>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his understanding
                response. Ballyhornan is an old RAF camp that must be —
                Members will pardon the pun — decommissioned from a military
                environment to a civilian one. The problem is multidepartmental.
                Fifty per cent of the people living there are schoolchildren or
                elderly people; it is a huge social problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has already identified the
                cross- cutting nature of the problem. Roads were built, and
                sewerage and water pipes laid without any of the necessary
                planning criteria being met. In fact, no permission was
                required. Those systems cannot be adapted to modern standards,
                so Departments must get together to provide at least basic
                standard amenities. Would the Minister lead an interdepartmental
                team? I have had several meetings with the Department of the
                Environment’s planning and housing divisions and with other
                Departments. There has been some good co-operation, but someone
                must take a lead; otherwise the plans will get nowhere.</p>

                or will shortly receive — a letter from me, in which I offer
                the services of one of our officials to help to find a way

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sympathise with the hon Member and his

                Such problems affect people’s quality of life, but it can be
                difficult to organise a co-ordinated response. The Housing
                Executive, for which my Department has responsibility, is active
                in the estate already, drawing together the relevant agencies in
                an attempt to resolve the problems. The Housing Executive is

                and agencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apart from providing £90,000 in grant aid
                for housing improvements, the Housing Executive is arranging for
                a mobile advice unit to visit the estate. That unit will promote
                home improvement options and will carry out a sample survey in
                the area to identify the issues of concern to local residents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Housing Executive has enlisted Groundwork
                Northern Ireland, together with Down District Council, to
                commence work with the local community group to plan
                environmental improvements for the area. My Department will play
                its part, and I am keen to see that it does, but since it is
                essentially a rural development matter, the Minister for
                Agriculture and Rural Development may wish to consider her role
                in co-ordinating that strategy.</p>

                Budget announced on 25 September 2001 by the Minister of Finance
                and Personnel. — <i>[The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee
                for Finance and Personnel (Mr Leslie).]</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to comment on some aspects of the
                draft Budget for the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development. The Committee welcomes the additional £2·2
                million allocated for BSE testing according to new European
                requirements. The Committee studied the bid carefully and
                supports it fully as an essential measure to regain export
                markets for Northern Ireland beef.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the matter was brought to a head by
                a visit of a committee of inspectors from Europe. Unfortunately,
                the Department had not maintained the full standards, and the
                leeway thus lost was used as an excuse to delay the vital
                decision of allowing our meat into the European market. Now that
                the Department has decided to spend this money, I trust that it
                will raise standards to the European level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is impossible to get away with anything in
                Europe. If one does not do it the European way, one brings
                disaster on oneself. If the standards that were set by the
                Department had been adhered to and the Committee had not been
                rushed, BSE testing might have been closer to the requirements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department has allocated a further £2
                million for the scrapie eradication programme. To the Committee’s
                knowledge, that was not the subject of a new bid. There was a
                successful bid for £2 million in the 2001-02 financial year,
                and this £2 million is presumably additional to that. Can the
                Minister confirm that in his response?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Workload pressures on animal disease control
                are also quoted in the draft Budget as part of an allocation of
                £3·4 million. The Committee agrees that disease eradication
                should be a departmental priority. Much of the Department’s
                annual Budget is spent on compensation payments to farmers whose
                animals fall victim to disease, particularly brucellosis and
                bovine tuberculosis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although it is vital to ensure that farmers’
                livelihoods are protected, a concerted effort must be made to
                eradicate disease. Compensation is not enough; eradication
                schemes must also be subsidised. Therefore, the Committee
                expects to see positive outcomes from the Minister’s reviews
                of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s
                disease policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although it concentrates on the agrifood
                industry, the Committee does not ignore the plight of the
                fishing industry and of the rural communities dependent on that
                industry. The Committee notes that part of the draft Budget
                figure of £3·4 million is allocated to the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">in several areas, including the cod recovery
                plan. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development was
                successful last year in securing £120,000 toward implementation
                costs in 2001-02. Members can only assume that this year’s
                allocation will also go to the plan’s administration and
                policing of fishing ground closures as part of that plan.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to remind Members that on 27 March
                2001 the Assembly unanimously agreed a motion calling on the
                Minister to provide short-term financial assistance to the
                fishing industry to compensate for restrictions coming from the
                cod recovery programme. The Minister’s reaction was that it
                was too late to act in the current year. She undertook to review
                the economic effects of the closures and to discuss the
                possibility of compensation, as permitted by Europe, with
                Colleagues in the other UK Fisheries Departments. However, she
                warned that it has not been the policy to compensate fishermen.
                It seems that one can take away a fisherman’s right to fish
                and yet give him no compensation. That is intolerable. If extra
                funding can be found for the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development’s administration of the cod recovery programme, it
                should also be possible to find funding to compensate fishermen
                for the sacrifice that they are forced to make when their
                fishing grounds are closed under the recovery programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee must welcome the increase of
                4·3% in the Department’s budget. However, the Committee
                recommends, in the strongest possible terms, that the Executive
                allocate additional funds to the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development in support of two hard-pressed industries in
                the Province — farming and fisheries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am now taking off my hat as Chairman of the
                Committee and am speaking in a personal capacity. My Deputy
                Chairperson will be referring to the important matter of a
                retirement scheme. Each Committee member would be at one about
                that scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also want to correct a rumour that has come
                out of the Department. When Mr Hume and I, as Members of the
                European Parliament, met Commissioner Byrne, he told us that
                European money was available. Of course, that money would have
                to be matched on a retirement scheme. It has been put out by the
                Department that that could not be. I would have thought that the
                Commissioner would know more about Europe than any member of the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development or the Minister
                herself. The Commissioner did tell us that money was available.
                There were four witnesses — Mr Hume had someone with him, and
                I had my friend with me. Four of us heard it, and we had quite a
                discussion about it. If that is the case, there should be a
                move. There seems to be a tremendous hold-up when one mentions a
                retirement scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I feel strongly about the fishing industry,
                and I regret the state that it is in. It is disastrous when men
                are put out of their livelihood, that their ships, with all the
                money that was spent on them, must be burned, battered and
                broken up, and nobody gets a penny. That is an utter scandal. If
                a man who has a boat leaves the business, why can he not sell
                that boat? It would not be used for fishing; it could be a
                residence or some sort of shed for use in the fishing industry.
                However, he cannot do that. No matter how many thousands of
                pounds have been paid, the boat must be broken up, and the
                fisherman must pay back the money that he got to repair that
                boat originally. I am glad that even the Alliance Party agrees
                with me on that one. I am thrilled to bits — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Please do not transubstantiate yourself, or I
                might change my mind.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are real wounds in the heart of the
                society of Northern Ireland, both in agriculture and in fishing.
                The Minister had to be Scrooge-like when he handed out his
                money, and I understand that. If the money is not there, he
                cannot hand it out. However, if we do not make some real moves
                to deal with these matters, the plight of agriculture and
                fishing will be even worse, and it will be even more difficult
                to extricate the fishermen from the mess they are in.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr O’Hagan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I have some general points on the draft Budget, and my
                Colleagues will make more specific ones.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are tied to the budgetary plans of the
                British Exchequer, which for generations has had an obsession
                with cutting taxes. We need a real increase in investment in
                public-sector infrastructure. Preoccupation with tax cuts, ahead
                of the duty to schools, hospitals, pensioners and a whole raft
                of issues, is part of being tied to the political philosophy of
                the British Exchequer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our departmental expenditure limit
                allocations, as set out by the Treasury, show a rise in public
                expenditure in 2002-03 of 5·8%, or about 3% more than
                inflation. However, many of the costs that affect public
                services are rising at a faster rate than inflation. The
                allocations for 2002-03 build on the 5·5% real-terms increase
                in the 2001-02 Budget, which has allowed Departments to initiate
                the work started on the Programme for Government priorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Barnett consequential that is used to
                calculate the block grant is unfair. It is a headcount that
                takes no account of need or of any meaningful adjustments to
                population structure. We have an ageing population, a high
                proportion of young people, higher levels of ill health and
                rural problems. There is an immediate need to increase spending
                on infrastructure, health, education, housing, roads, rail, and
                power, as well as on information and telecommunications
                technology.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout the North of Ireland, and with the
                Dublin Government, we must find funds to build not just a
                North/South economic corridor, but an east-west, cross- border
                corridor. We do not want to see the good work done in the
                Assembly with the return of local democracy being undermined and
                undone by a parsimonious British Chancellor. An
                inflation-busting increase in the regional rates for the second
                year in a row will leave many businesses and households running
                for cover. Although businesses have been spared the worst of the
                increases with a 3·3% increase for the second year,
                householders have been hit by yet another 7% rates hike, also
                for a second year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that the Minister of Finance and
                Personnel and the entire Assembly need to unite and put that
                matter to the British Exchequer. There is a legacy of
                underfunding. We have a need that is not reflected in the
                headcount of the Barnett formula. We are a society emerging from
                conflict.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin would like to see the creation of
                an all-Ireland economy. That is the only way that this island’s
                economy can be more successful. The first step towards that goal
                is tax-varying powers for the Assembly. Unfortunately, we are
                not currently in a position to have those. In the meantime, we
                need a co-ordinated strategy to deal with the flawed and unfair
                Barnett formula that allocates our block grant. We need to ask
                why the massive British war machine expenditure has not been
                redeployed to support our transition to a more peaceful, stable,
                prosperous, fair and outward- looking society. The Assembly
                should also negotiate with the Irish Government for an increase
                in their commitments to expenditure on cross-border programmes
                and services, and on all-Ireland bodies through the North/South
                Ministerial Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should work towards eradicating community
                differentials, ending discrimination and tackling disadvantage.
                We need to spend much more on the community and voluntary
                sectors, instead of starving them of resources. Their dire
                situation is compounded by the twin problems of the gap in the
                European funding that supports so much of those sectors’ work,
                and the retreat of mainstream funding. The community and
                voluntary sectors deal with problems such as drug and alcohol
                abuse by giving advice and practical assistance. They are a
                vital community resource, especially in the most disadvantaged
                and marginalised areas. Thousands of people employed in those
                sectors face job losses because of the lack of gap funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regeneration of towns and villages is
                also a victim of the Budget, with annual allocations being
                slashed by 4·4%. Given the millions pumped into the Laganside
                project in east Belfast, expenditure on town and village
                regeneration should be given priority in order to create a level
                playing field.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rather than tinkering around the edges, we
                should be developing a comprehensive plan to deal with the
                flawed and unfair Barnett formula that is used to work out our
                block grant allocation. There is also an onus on the Irish
                Government to spread the benefits of the &quot;Celtic
                tiger&quot;, and we need to put pressure on the British
                Government, not only about the Barnett formula but on the
                provision of the peace dividend.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The peace process has been in place for a
                number of years, yet we are still waiting for the money sucked
                up by the British war machine to be redeployed. We are a society
                emerging from conflict, continuing to suffer the social and
                economic consequences of that conflict. No adequate provision is
                contained in the Budget or financial estimates for the legacy of
                discrimination, inequality and injustice in the north of Ireland
                that needs to be redressed as a matter of urgency. Go raibh
                maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not wish to use the opportunity afforded
                by this debate on the draft Budget to criticise the allocation
                of money to the various Departments. I am sure that the Minister
                will be pleased to hear that. Nor do I intend to rehearse the
                old arguments about the iniquity of increases in the regional
                rate that are above the rate of inflation. I am sure that the
                Minister will be doubly delighted to hear that. Rather, I shall
                use the opportunity to question the whole concept and
                methodology of our Budget process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been three years since the Assembly
                first met, and in many respects we are still slavishly following
                customs and practices of the past. Although such practices may
                have served society well in the past, they ignore the stark
                realities of the present. The money that we are spending is not
                the Government’s money; it is not the Executive’s money. It
                is taxpayer’s money. That money is departmentalised — it is
                locked away in particular Departments. It is spent by
                Departments, and each is hell-bent on ensuring that it gets its
                percentage increase year on year oblivious to, or without
                concern for, the stark realities of life that exist outside.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sums of money allocated and the
                percentage increases awarded can be justified when viewed in the
                context of a particular Department. For instance, who could
                question that more money needs to be spent on roads, transport,
                water and sewerage services. However, the justification becomes
                less meaningful when viewed against what must be the Assembly’s
                number-one priority: the health of our people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive say that they prioritise
                expenditure, and to a small degree that is true. However, words
                have not yet been backed up with sufficient resources. The
                Assembly and the Executive pronounce publicly that health is the
                number one priority, but do Members mean what they say? Do the
                Ministers and the members of each Statutory Committee feel in
                their heart of hearts that health is the number-one priority,
                and do they treat it as such? Is their own Department their
                number-one priority? Do they not clamour year in, year out for
                more of that finite resource called money for their Departments?
                Ultimately, that is at the expense of health. Everyone wants his
                or her extra pound of flesh.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To say that there is a crisis in the Health
                Service is no exaggeration; it is an understatement. It is not
                an exaggeration to say that people are dying because of lack of
                resources. Thousands of people, maybe tens of thousands, are
                waiting for proper coronary care. The new cancer unit has been
                further delayed. There is a shortage of surgeons, nurses, beds,
                et cetera. Members could rehearse the problems, and they could
                beat their breasts. However, there is a huge void when it comes
                to doing what is necessary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the past number of weeks I have tried to
                ascertain what the word &quot;priority&quot; means in the
                Assembly. I have asked all the Ministers to release at least
                £10 million from their budgets to alleviate the crisis in the
                Health Service. Such a move would increase the health budget by
                at least £90 million. I met with some interesting results. In a
                number of cases my questions were ruled inadmissible. However, I
                was not told that by any Minister: I was told it by others who
                appear to rule on whether a Member may ask a question on behalf
                of his constituents. That is a strange form of democracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of my questions were referred to the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel on the grounds that it was his
                responsibility. That is an interesting concept. The Minister of
                Finance and Personnel apparently decides whether the Department
                of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Department of the
                Environment, or any other Department, can release money. That is
                what I have been told. In one case I got a straight
                &quot;No&quot;. The Minister in question acknowledged the
                pressures on the Health Service but said that transferring £10
                million would have severe implications for his or her
                Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So much for priority. So much for those
                citizens crying out for urgent health care. So much for those
                who are waiting on trolleys. So much for those who are dying. In
                the overall scheme of things, is it more important to save a
                life or to spend an extra £300,000 in support of the Foyle,
                Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, or an extra £500,000
                on veterinary services? Is it not more important to resource
                more nurses and surgeons than to increase expenditure on
                accommodation or give an extra £5 million to the Environment
                and Heritage Service?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is transport more important than cancer care
                or community care packages? We are the guardians of the public
                purse. Our management of that purse must reflect the real and
                pressing needs of society — the taxpayers. Would a businessman
                or businesswoman continue with an expensive advertising campaign
                if that meant laying off production workers because of scarce
                resources and a cash-flow problem? Would the parents of a
                terminally ill child spend money on redecorating their home or
                buying a new car, or would they keep money in the bank if that
                money could save their child’s life?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How can the Assembly justify keeping tens of
                millions of pounds in Executive programme funds for future
                spending, when people will die because that money is not being
                spent now? The draft Budget fails to give meaning to the word
                &quot;priority&quot;. It fails the people. The Assembly has
                proved adept at changing rules over the past few days. I suggest
                that it put the same effort into changing practices of the past
                and give a real and meaningful definition to the word
                &quot;priority&quot;.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Watson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the opening debate on the draft Budget
                on 25 September, the Chairman of the Environment Committee
                questioned the Minister of Finance and Personnel on the justice
                of the proposal to cut £2 million from the resources grant
                payable to those councils with the weakest rates base. Neither
                the Minister of Finance and Personnel nor the Minister of the
                Environment has explained the logic of that proposal. It takes
                £2 million from the weakest councils to pay for compliance with
                EU legislation that is primarily on waste management, which will
                benefit everyone, including people in the strongest rates-base
                councils.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask those Ministers again — and Members
                — how that stands with the key policy theme in the Executive’s
                draft Programme for Government of targeting social need and the
                promotion of equality of opportunity. The Environment Committee
                has received letters from 14 local councils protesting against
                the £2 million cut and highlighting the unfairness of targeting
                the weakest rates-base councils. The Committee has forwarded
                those letters to the Minister of Finance and Personnel and the
                Executive, and has asked that the proposal to cut the local
                government resources grant be dropped from the 2002-03 Budget.
                Those letters show that the £2 million cut will have a major
                impact on local government services and rates in some of the
                poorest and most socially deprived areas of Northern Ireland. I
                ask the Minister of Finance and Personnel to give this matter
                serious and urgent consideration.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for
                Employment and Learning (Dr Birnie):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to focus on two main areas in relation
                to the draft Budget: first, adult basic skills, and secondly,
                research and development spending, particularly regarding
                Northern Ireland’s universities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to address the policy response to and
                funding of adult basic literacy and numeracy. The Committee for
                Employment and Learning was pleased that additional money was
                granted to that area in the first round of Executive programme
                funds. However, the sum granted at that time was less than the
                30% of what the Department had asked for. No additional funding
                has been provided since then. Those problems are sufficiently
                serious to warrant further funding. This is a fundamental social
                problem that has implications for individuals’ employability
                and state of health and has an impact on general economic growth
                and productivity.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We welcome the fact that the most recent
                draft of the Programme for Government placed increased emphasis
                on that area. One quarter of the adult population here falls
                into the category of the lowest measured level of ability either
                to read or count. Along with Great Britain, the Republic of
                Ireland and the United States, Northern Ireland languishes at
                the bottom of the international league with regard to adult
                basic skills. This seems to imply that something systemic has
                gone wrong with basic education — particularly primary
                education — in the English-speaking world. That has happened
                in the past. Our priority is to ensure that this problem will
                never be recreated for future generations in primary and
                secondary schools. We also need to deal with those currently in
                the labour force who have a tragic inability to read or exercise
                basic numeracy. We appeal for additional moneys in that area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My second concern in respect of employment
                and learning is R&amp;D, as based in universities in Northern
                Ireland. The issue of the contribution of the training and
                education system to industry was given prominence in our
                Committee’s report about three weeks ago. Subsequent to that
                report, the vice-chancellors of Queen’s University and the
                University of Ulster gave evidence to the Committee in the
                strongest possible terms about what they saw as the inadequacy
                of the funding provided for R&amp;D in general, and
                university-based R&amp;D in particular.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a strong positive relationship
                between the proportion of R&amp;D spending in any country or
                region as a percentage of regional or national gross domestic
                product (GDP) and the subsequent economic growth rate. It is
                worrying that Northern Ireland lies at the bottom of a second
                league table: that of Organisation of Economic Co-operation and
                Development (OECD) countries. We fall in the class occupied by
                countries such as Turkey and Hungary. We have an R&amp;D spend
                of only 0·6% of regional GDP, compared to 1% in the Republic of
                Ireland, where the spend has increased rapidly over the last
                five or six years, and roughly 2% in the United Kingdom as a
                whole. Thirty per cent of the R&amp;D spend in Northern Ireland
                is carried out in universities, compared to under one fifth in
                the UK as a whole. The universities will therefore have a
                pivotal role in increasing the level of R&amp;D spend in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When presenting their evidence to the
                Committee, the two vice-chancellors argued very similar cases,
                making the point that the Welsh and Scottish Administrations
                have substantially increased the level of public support for
                university-based R&amp;D since devolution. Locally, that has yet
                to happen to the same degree. It was also noted that a continued
                decrease in university-based R&amp;D would have a negative
                knock-on effect on the economy and on society. The private
                sector would suffer from a resulting reduction in the numbers of
                so-called spin-off companies. Many of these are high-growth and
                high-tech entrepreneurial companies. There would also be
                implications for the public sector generally. The Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development and the Department of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety, which rely heavily on the
                universities to do background research to aid the development of
                future policies, would find resources less forthcoming.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both universities anticipate improved
                performance in the current research assessment exercise. Sadly,
                as things stand, there will not be enough money in the kitty to
                reward those university departments that have improved their
                measured research output with a commensurate increase in
                funding. This will remain true even if the bid for £4·5
                million extra for university- based R&amp;D is realised from the
                current round of Executive programme funds. Northern Ireland’s
                universities, through no fault of their own, are slipping
                further behind their counterparts in Great Britain as
                initiatives and funding announced in London are not being read
                across to Stormont.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Departments may be able to make more
                apparently striking cases for extra money. However, the long
                term as well as the short term must be considered. The crucial
                point about R&amp;D spending is that it is an investment. There
                is no doubt, according to the available evidence, that it helps
                increase future economic growth. For instance, it provides
                additional resources that could be used to provide funding for
                the health sector, which Mr Close talked about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a sense it is a partial answer to Mr Close’s
                point about asking each Department to give £10 million to the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. That
                action might provide some short-term relief as regards waiting
                lists, but it would do nothing to generate future economic
                growth. That is the only sound and sustainable basis for an
                adequate level of health, social or educational spending in the
                Province. Unless the Northern Ireland Executive face up to the
                challenge of matching the commitment to R&amp;D already being
                shown by their counterparts in London and in the other devolved
                Administrations in Cardiff and Edinburgh, devolution will fail
                to lay the foundations for a more prosperous future here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to close by making some more general
                points about the Budget. To do so, I remove my Employment and
                Learning Committee Chairman’s hat. I commend the Minister of
                Finance and Personnel on his stamina. By the end of the debate
                he will probably feel that he has heard many of the speeches
                before, and he is likely to hear similar speeches again in the
                future. That is the nature of such debates. Certain matters are
                so important that they deserve to be returned to again and again
                until the Executive deal with them adequately through the Budget
                and the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 2002-03 Budget is designed to deal
                particularly with changes in spending and to focus on areas that
                are deemed by the Department of Finance and Personnel to be new
                or inescapable commitments. It is not about a fundamental review
                of the baseline of expenditure and of the annual growth rate of
                expenditure of each Department. Such a fundamental review is
                projected for the following year’s Budget. However, given that
                such a review of baselines is so necessary, I suspect that we
                will be treading constantly in that territory in the debate.
                Perhaps that is no bad thing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a debate such as this, many Members will
                yield to the strong temptation to bash the Treasury, for
                example, on the Barnett formula’s inadequate funding of public
                expenditure here. In that context, I suggest that when Dr O’Hagan
                of Sinn Féin speaks about tax-varying powers, it must be
                recognised that that will almost inevitably mean substantial
                tax-increasing powers. We must be clear about that before we ask
                for it. The danger of asking for gifts is that you will be given
                them and that, sometimes, they are not really gifts at all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the point about the island economy and the
                alleged desirability of it, we must be clear about what is being
                asked for. The level of public spending in Northern Ireland is
                substantially greater by several billions pounds per annum than
                the level of tax revenues received. Therefore, if stress is
                being put on the so-called all-island, or all-Ireland,
                dimension, it must be asked whether Sinn Féin has asked the
                Minister for Finance in the Dublin Government, Mr McCreevy,
                whether he would be willing to contribute those several billion
                pounds, especially as his own fiscal position has become more
                difficult since 11 September. I am pretty sure what the answer
                would be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I understand it, the Executive programme
                funds were designed to engineer innovative areas of spending
                additional to what would have been spent anyway. Moreover, the
                funds were to encourage the so-called joined-up pattern of
                Government expenditure that we have so often been encouraged to
                promote, particularly interdepartmental initiatives. It is a
                real source of regret that, as of yet, there have been
                relatively few such genuinely inter- or multi-departmental
                initiatives. Overall, there is not much evidence that the funds
                have been leading, at least so far, to genuinely additional,
                innovative or joined-up measures. There is a great danger that
                they have simply become a contingency fund for public
                expenditure in Northern Ireland by another name.</p>

                million. However, the Committee still has several major concerns
                about the level of underfunding that continues to inhibit the
                Department’s activities. I am required to mention a few of
                them on behalf of the Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first is the safe sports grounds scheme,
                which was warmly welcomed by the Committee and the House when it
                was introduced. Unfortunately that scheme received only £1
                million, when there was a lot more to be allocated in that
                direction. It is interesting and concerning that, of all the
                bids for sport in our departmental budget, that was the only one
                that received any recognition at all. The money received was
                below what was expected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was also great disappointment among the
                Committee Members because of the failure of the arts bids, which
                totalled some £4 million. Sometimes other Committees and those
                who sit on them forget that the Department of Culture, Arts and
                Leisure has a very small budget indeed. If £10 million were
                taken out of it, as Mr Close suggested, that would be almost one
                sixth of the budget. Compare that with some of the
                higher-spending Departments — for example, one sixth of the
                health budget would amount to £250 million.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like-for-like calculations do not apply. We
                are working with such small amounts of money that often, if the
                figures for our projects were to be rounded up by other
                Departments, they would be &quot;lost in the roundings&quot;.
                That would make a tremendous difference to our objectives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to bear in mind the need for
                serious action in the arts sector, particularly in the light of
                the launch of Belfast’s bid to become the European Capital of
                Culture 2008. That campaign is exciting and has captured the
                imagination of many, but it must be based on certain fundamental
                building blocks. One of the most important of those, which, in
                general terms would be considered a small bid — £1 million
                — is the Grand Opera House development scheme. The project
                would be a key plank in Belfast’s application to become the
                European Capital of Culture, and recently the Committee was very
                concerned to note that there was a competing interest in the
                site. The Grand Opera House cannot bid for the site because of a
                lack of funds, and the expansion programme could be in jeopardy.
                A unique opportunity to enhance the arts infrastructure of the
                city would be lost, and it would be difficult to explain that in
                future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is also concerned about such
                important institutions in the Department’s responsibility as
                museums, the Armagh Observatory and the Planetarium. Recent
                research revealed that the budget for museums was cut by 8% in
                1994. That historic underfunding has been inherited; the
                situation has never been rectified, and institutions have been
                trying to exist on a drastically reduced budget. The seriousness
                of the position is illustrated by the proposal to sell off
                Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland (MAGNI) property, at
                least in part, to meet the deficit. The Committee was concerned
                to learn about that proposal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our concern is that we will have to strip the
                assets of our arts and culture sector in order to survive. I
                place on record the fact that the Committee’s deep concern was
                reflected in its strong opposition to such an approach.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure
                has inherited a problem as a result of a library staffing review
                which was initiated by the former Department of Education for
                Northern Ireland at a cost of £10 million. The Department’s
                bid for the £10 million to cover the cost of the review until
                the current year is OK, but, should its in-year bid fail, the
                Committee would not expect the Department to find the money from
                its own resources. That would also be our position on any
                in-year bid in 2003 for the additional £2 million that is still
                unmet in the draft Budget. The situation was not of the
                Department’s making, and the Committee for Culture, Arts and
                Leisure would not support any attempt to fund a pre-devolution
                review from the Department’s already inadequate resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Committee expressed pleasure
                that the Department’s bid for additional staffing had been
                met. That staffing is fundamental to departmental organisation,
                the creation of a proper corporate structure and the improvement
                of its services to customers and to the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has known for some time that
                staff shortages have meant that progress on many important areas
                of work, which would have had a considerable social and economic
                impact on the community, have had to be deferred. It hopes that
                the additional resources for staffing show that some recognition
                is being given to placing the funding requirement for the
                Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure on a proper footing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Leaving aside my role as the Chairperson of
                the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure, I wish to ask a
                question on a matter that several Members mentioned: the
                all-Ireland economy. As we move to an integrated economy in
                Europe, has the Minister any comments to make on how Budgets,
                particularly in a cross-border setting, could be affected by the
                introduction of the euro? I represent a border constituency, and
                I know the concerns that many people have about the ordinary,
                everyday changes that will come about as a result of the euro’s
                introduction. Has the Department of Finance and Personnel made
                appropriate plans to cope with any problems that may emerge?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley spoke about the fishing industry.
                He made the point about the shortfall and the need for support,
                especially this year, for the cod recovery plan. However, other
                issues must be reiterated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first issue came to the fore in my
                constituency in the past month. Complaints about health services
                apply across the Province, not just in Strangford. The worrying
                trend in Newtownards is that the trust intends to reduce the
                amount of time that home helps spend with pensioners and with
                the handicapped. That causes concern in my constituency and is a
                result of the stress and contraction of the budget that is
                allocated to the community care side of the Health Service. It
                is totally inadequate to deal with the needs of people in the
                area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several elderly constituents have contacted
                my advice centre. They were distressed because their home helps,
                who previously made their meals, had been replaced by meals on
                wheels, which the trust has said is more cost-effective. The
                trust has failed to acknowledge the therapy — I purposely use
                the word &quot;therapy&quot; — that home helps provide the
                people on whom they call. They do not simply make a meal; they
                spend 15 minutes to half an hour talking to the senior citizens
                or the handicapped people, who, in turn, are made to feel that
                despite being infirm they are not completely divorced from the
                rest of the world. We must address the despair and isolation
                that many elderly people feel, because, ultimately, that will
                lead to health deterioration and depression.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week, I met the chief executive of the
                Ulster Community and Hospitals Trust. Although he sympathised
                with the home-help situation, he felt that it was the latest in
                a catalogue of budgeting blunders that have left the National
                Health Service, both in Northern Ireland and in the rest of the
                United Kingdom, at a loss. He reiterated that the necessary
                budget is not there to cope with the demands. Last year, the
                Ulster Community and Hospitals Trust provided nine additional
                complex care packages. Members will know that there is now a
                greater demand on care packages; higher levels of need exist.
                This year, the trust has 60 extra cases, which compounds the
                issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that the elderly population in
                Strangford is rising also adds to the problem. The population
                there contains 75% more elderly people than any other area in
                Northern Ireland. We have lost some nursing homes, and many
                residential homes cannot cope with the pressures that the system
                places on them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my trust area, we have been told that
                £500,000 would be needed to provide the appropriate level of
                home-help and care-package assistance. If we multiply that
                figure across the Province, we shall find that the issue needs
                to be addressed in all community trusts. It is hard to
                understand the situation here when we find that £300 million is
                available in England and Wales to get people out of hospitals
                and into the community. That money will dramatically reduce
                waiting lists. Why is the same emphasis not placed on solving
                the problem in Northern Ireland? Is Northern Ireland, once
                again, the poor relation in the United Kingdom?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Disabled sport is also affected by the draft
                Budget. We all remember the last Paralympic Games, and one would
                imagine that everyone would be behind our disabled sportsmen and
                sportswomen. Instead, we find that a paltry sum of £30,000 is
                set aside to appoint a development officer to an umbrella
                organisation. Nothing has been contributed to the Special
                Olympics. Given that our disabled athletes can bring home more
                medals than our able-bodied ones, the lack of funding is
                scandalous. Northern Ireland has many disabled sportsmen and
                sportswomen who were injured as a result of the troubles of the
                past 30 years. Often, the only release that those people can
                find from the frustration and anger that they feel towards those
                who caused their injuries is through sport. We should make every
                effort to ensure that disabled people who want to be involved in
                sport have the opportunity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Culture, Arts and
                Leisure Committee mentioned the details of the bids. Looking
                down the list, I see that almost every bid was unsuccessful. It
                is frustrating that the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee has
                been unable to achieve the level of support needed to deal with
                many of the matters that fall within its remit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is disappointing that the Minister of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety seems more intent on
                spending money to promote the Irish language and her culture
                than on spending it on health provision that everyone wants.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A bid for £500,000 was put forward for
                languages, but it was unsuccessful. I am concerned, given the
                failure to provide money for languages, that Ulster Scots will
                not receive adequate financial assistance. There has been a
                great resurgence of interest in Ulster Scots, but not enough
                money is being allocated to it. The BBC has an Irish programme
                on the radio every night and an Irish television programme
                several times a year. However, we are yet to see an Ulster-Scots
                programme, and I would like to see that happen. I know that that
                does not fall directly within the remit of the Department of
                Culture, Arts and Leisure, but perhaps such programme
                development is something that we should all work towards. The
                BBC must work towards it too.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Money must be put into the programmes that
                people want, and into language programmes, which are clearly
                needed. The failure to allocate sufficient money to the
                Ulster-Scots language is widely recognised. Such inequality and
                inequity is a bitter indictment of some people’s lack of
                understanding about the rights and cultural identity that I
                share with many people in the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am disappointed that the bid for
                motor-sport safety improvements was also unsuccessful. Only one
                bid out of about a dozen was successful. The Committee tries to
                promote and ensure improved safety at road-racing circuits.
                Although £100,000 was set aside for that previously, the
                Committee is concerned that this year’s bid for £100,000 has
                not been successful.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Road racing is a unique sport in Northern
                Ireland. Indeed, it is unique within the British Isles.
                Road-racing clubs and followers are keen to promote their sport,
                and it is important that the sport be encouraged and that it can
                progress. That can happen only if money is allocated for the
                necessary safety improvements. The clubs and the road-racing
                enthusiasts are keen to see improvements in the circuits and
                safety standards. It would not take much money to improve the
                circuits in the Province, but I am concerned that the £100,000
                needed to ensure the short-term and long-term future of motor
                sports will not be provided in the Budget. About 100,000 people
                follow the sport — it is truly a sport for everyone, and it
                needs help.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The
                Deputy Chairperson of the Finance and Personnel Committee has
                asked us to take note of the draft Budget announced by the
                Minister in September. Several Members have mentioned the
                problems faced by the Health Service as a whole. As a member of
                the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, I
                shall give some detail of the problems faced by the Health
                Service daily.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Various groups have told us about the state
                of the Health Service. We have heard stories from children’s
                organisations, the elderly, homes and hospitals, and we have
                heard about many problems from waiting lists to trolley waits.
                Everyone agrees that the Barnett formula is fundamentally
                flawed, that it is merely a headcount that must be changed. The
                formula does not take into account our high levels of ill health
                and the many children at risk, our ageing population and long
                waiting lists. I could go on — the list is endless.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety was informed that the Department’s draft Budget
                bid was £275 million. The Committee was told that that was the
                amount needed merely to maintain the service as it is with its
                high waiting lists, trolley waits and so on. A plaster was put
                over them. However, the Department did not receive that amount.
                The amount received fell £121 million short of the original
                bid. I should like to ask the Deputy Chairperson of the
                Committee for Finance and Personnel Committee and the Minister
                where that will leave the Health Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I totally agree with Séamus Close. I accept
                that this is a test for the Executive as a whole — they must
                tackle this problem, and by the Executive I mean every Minister
                in the Executive. This is a real test for collective
                responsibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several weeks ago the Health Committee sent
                out letters requesting meetings with the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister and the Minister of
                Finance and Personnel. It might be easier if we could meet him
                when he wears both hats. This is not only the responsibility of
                the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and
                the Minister of Finance and Personnel; there is collective
                responsibility in question.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Finance Minister acknowledged that the
                proposed allocation to the Health Department would, at best,
                only allow it to maintain the provision of services. Critically,
                key commitments in the Programme for Government will have to be
                deferred. Given the serious situation which all parties have
                agreed exists, there must be a fundamental review of the
                allocation of money to the Department of Health, Social Services
                and Public Safety.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members said earlier that if it means
                withholding funds from other Departments, so be it. Mr Close did
                point this out, quite rightly. Perhaps we can take on board what
                one Member from the Ulster Unionist party said about the
                Executive programme funds — allocate them to the Health
                Service to try to alleviate some of the pressures it is facing
                and the pressures it will face through the winter crisis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also sit on the Public Accounts Committee.
                Many who have spoken here today are criticising the Budget,
                saying there is a need for additional money for whatever
                Department or Committee they sit on. It is my view, as a member
                of the Public Accounts Committee over the last year, that public
                money has been wasted in various Departments. I need not
                rehearse the arguments because people have seen the media
                stories and have read the reports from the Comptroller and
                Auditor General and the Committee. We must look closely at
                giving value for money and at saving money from Departments
                rather than always crying out for additional money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stress that we need a review of the budget
                for the Health Service. Taking on board what the Deputy
                Chairperson has said, I shall take note of the Budget. However,
                I also take note of the present state of the Health Service and
                call for a fundamental review of its budget. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad to hear that the alarm is finally
                being raised in the Assembly about the disappointing increase in
                the health budget. Unless all Members and, indeed, all Ministers
                in the Executive come together and agree this as the number-one
                priority, we will bring disaster on those overstretched
                services, overstressed workers and demoralised staff — never
                mind what we are doing to the patients.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A real increase of only 7·2% was bad enough,
                but it will be even worse, going down, not up, to a 5·4%
                increase for 2003-04. I do not know whether any Assembly Member
                can walk into a local hospital or healthcare centre and tell
                people what he or she is going to do. They are cutting, and
                cutting and cutting. We need only look at the level of hygiene,
                the waiting lists, the patients on trolleys and the stressed-out
                workers who are just walking away. They feel — and they told
                us — that they cannot meet their professional standards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not what people were promised, and I
                know that it is not the fault of the Minister of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety. It is time that we stopped leaving
                it at the Minister’s door. I am also aware that the Minister
                of Finance and Personnel has done all in his power to deal with
                these matters. However, I ask him and the Executive to look at
                the matter again. We await the outcome of the September
                monitoring round.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also like the Minister to know that
                the Health Committee is trying to save money — he may not hear
                that too often. We are carrying out an inquiry into why 9% of
                outpatient clinics are cancelled, as that clearly wastes money.
                We are trying to find out if some of that money can be recouped
                for the Health Service. It has quite a lot to do with
                consultants cancelling appointments at short notice — I hope
                that it does not happen in psychiatry, Mr Speaker, but I hear it
                is happening right across the board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr Shannon that we could also
                save money in community care. The statistics speak for
                themselves. If we had enough packages, we could immediately
                start to release some of the 150 patients who are in hospital
                beds only because they cannot move into the community. The
                Committee has calculated that, as the average stay in hospital
                is one week, 50 additional patients could be treated each week,
                which amounts to 7,500 patients a year. We must think about
                cost- efficiency and get a proper plan in place to co-ordinate
                services, save money and put it back into the service, rather
                than constantly demanding more.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are the Minister and the Deputy Chairperson
                of the Committee for Finance and Personnel satisfied with the
                Executive funds? I can see neither rhyme nor reason to them, and
                I cannot understand how some of those headings and bids ended up
                where they are. They could equally come out of mainstream
                departmental funds, and we could explain them much more easily.
                They do not sit easily under their current themes or with the
                infrastructure funds, in which substantial funds are set aside
                for the development of hospitals or schools. Those moneys are
                welcome, but they should not be part of the Executive funds;
                they should be in the departmental bids, so that we can
                scrutinise those budgets properly. Only three of the funds were
                up for bids this time; the other two were not. It is difficult
                to keep the entire Budget together, and Committees find it hard
                to see what Departments are doing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety has fared badly, and I look forward to seeing
                whether the new cancer hospital at the City Hospital site will
                get funds under the infrastructure bid, which now seems to be
                the only bid that still has substantial funds in it. Perhaps the
                cancer hospital should not have been funded from that bid in the
                first place. I would never support salami-slicing the block
                grant in that way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To what extent have the Minister and the
                Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of the Finance and Personnel
                Committee been able to make criticisms of the waste highlighted
                in audit reports? Have Departments been asked to explain
                themselves? One example of such waste is the huge amount of
                compensation that was paid out by the Department of Agriculture
                and Rural Development after the Department allowed its own herd
                in the research centre to become infected with brucellosis and
                had to replace it. That was a scandal that should not have
                happened, as the Northern Ireland Audit Office stated clearly in
                its exemplary report. Has there been a proper inquiry? Our
                Departments would have welcomed the £22 million that was spent
                on that, rather than seeing it go on something that will not
                even produce any benefits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also a question over some
                departmental running costs. Why did the Department for Social
                Development need an increase of £20 million — 12% — over
                last year’s figure? There may be a reason why the Department
                of Culture, Arts and Leisure might require a 21% increase — it
                is still a new Department — but why would an established
                Department require such a huge sum for administration or running
                costs? I have already said that that Department wasted £1
                million this year on unpublished consultancy reports. Neither
                Assembly Members nor the public had the benefit of knowing what
                was in those reports.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are still major concerns, and we have a
                long way to go to get it right.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To offer the Minister some sympathy: I
                supported his call — and I continue to support it — to
                address the issue of rates seriously. If the Assembly is to be
                responsible and mature it can no longer expect to meet
                departmental bids if it does not, at the same time, ask people
                to address the issue of rate increases seriously. I take issue
                with Séamus Close — he cannot ask for money while simply
                saying that there should be some tax-varying power. I hope that
                such a proposal could be sold to people if the Assembly could
                show where the money was being put, particularly if it could
                explain that a certain percentage was going directly into health
                and education. I have no doubt that that would make our jobs
                much easier.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                Agriculture and Rural Development (Mr Savage):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened to the debate, and for the
                first time everyone agrees about one thing — they are all
                looking for support from the Minister. I agree with what the
                Chairperson of the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee
                said about the draft Budget and how it affects the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development, particularly regarding
                provision for the implementation of an action plan for the
                agrifood industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is one area that he did not cover —
                the prospect of an early retirement scheme for farmers. Members
                will know that it is a subject that I care deeply about. The
                Committee has also frequently stated its position that there is
                a genuine need for a retirement scheme and new entrants’
                scheme. As recently as 6 July, the Committee put down a marker
                that assistance could be sought for such schemes through the
                Executive. As the Chairperson said, Executive programme funds
                are likely to be oversubscribed and in big demand. There is no
                provision in the draft Budget for the introduction of a
                retirement scheme, which is necessary if farming in Northern
                Ireland is to be successfully restructured. The vision group,
                which has been working this past six months and which was
                referred to by the Chairperson, does not support a retirement
                scheme. Any funds ultimately secured for implementing the group’s
                recommendations will not, therefore, go towards a retirement
                scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There remains the hope that the Minister will
                be convinced that a retirement scheme is a constructive way of
                managing structural change. When the Committee met with the
                Minister on 12 October she explained that she had commissioned
                research on it that should be available next year. A year is a
                long time. I trust that the research will be closely considered.
                Retirement schemes are run in parts of the EU, such as Holland
                and France.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the main objections to such schemes is
                the cost. In June, the Minister quoted a figure of £30 million
                for a scheme involving 750 farmers. That is nonsense. There are
                schemes taking place in other countries and they are
                self-financing. All such schemes need is the backing of the
                Government and the Department of Finance and Personnel. Cheaper
                alternatives are a fact and must be pursued.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If — and it is a big &quot;if&quot; — the
                Minister agreed to implement a retirement scheme, the main
                funding for it would come from modulation moneys, together with
                Treasury match-funding of those amounts. This is money that has
                been skimmed off farmers’ direct subsidies and is matched
                pound-for-pound by the Treasury. It would effectively have no
                impact on the overall Northern Ireland Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, if there was a shortfall and
                modulation funding was insufficient to cover the cost of a
                scheme, I suggest that money could be found from the Budget. I
                am sure that fellow Committee members and other Members who
                understand farming would agree with me. In every other sector
                where recruitment difficulties are being experienced, such as
                teaching and medicine, the Government creates special financial
                facilities such as cheap, interest-free loans for housing for
                key workers, et cetera. A recent news bulletin reported that
                such incentives are being introduced to rectify a shortage of
                key-sector workers in an area of England. Why should farming be
                treated differently? Farmers do not want anything for free, and
                they are prepared to pay back any money that they might borrow
                under a long-term low-interest loan scheme — they are not
                scroungers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the farming industry is to meet the
                demands of a growing European market, it must receive the
                support of the Government. Primary producers and the
                manufacturing sector are too often ignored, yet they are the
                basic wealth-producers on which the service industries rest. If
                that attitude is not supported, economic decline will be
                inevitable. The vision group has called for</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a dynamic, integrated, innovative and
                profitable agricultural industry&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we cannot achieve that without the
                restructuring of farming. Only the loan scheme proposed by our
                Committee will achieve all that, and it is accepted that loans
                must be paid back. Farming needs the protection and the backing
                of the Government. For too long this matter has been kicked into
                touch by the Minister. We debated the matter last December,
                almost a year ago. The Committee has now decided to initiate a
                study by a team of academics, which will bury a live issue in a
                committee of so-called experts. As I said last year, we need
                action. The matter should not be put on the back burner — we
                need action today. The rest of Europe has no problems with such
                action, so why should we?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the improvements that will be
                brought about by budgetary increases. If we do not do enough to
                help the industry, we will only be playing about, tinkering with
                the side issues. Mr Speaker, given your farming background and
                your interest in the industry, you will know that, if farmers do
                not achieve support, we will be in trouble. Although many
                Members do not think very much about farming, it must be
                remembered that, if one of the aeroplanes taking part in the
                terrorist attack of 11 September had hit its target, there would
                have been a big dependency on agriculture. We must protect and
                take pride in the agriculture industry.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to speak in the
                Budget debate. I will make points relating to the Enterprise,
                Trade and Investment Committee, of which I am a member.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a recent Assembly debate on the
                safeguarding of industries in Northern Ireland, the Minister for
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment said that Northern Ireland
                faced its stiffest economic test in more than a decade. He also
                said that we must ensure that Northern Ireland is strategically
                placed to take advantage of the upturn when it takes place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the proposed Budget for 2002-03 there is a
                slight decrease in the allocation of funding to the Department
                of Enterprise, Trade and Investment: £7·7 million this year,
                £5·8 million next year, and £3 million the following year for
                the telecommunications strategy. The Department’s ability to
                spend £7·7 million this year has been held back for various
                reasons. It is therefore important that the Department be given
                end-of-year flexibility to carry forward underspending from this
                year into 2002-03.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are other concerns, particularly in
                relation to Invest Northern Ireland, which is the body that is
                to replace the IDB, LEDU, IRTU and some aspects of tourism
                funding. We need to ensure that sufficient resources are
                allocated to Invest Northern Ireland for maximum effect and that
                regionalisation is top of the agenda. There has been an economic
                downturn with potential for job losses, particularly in the
                aerospace and airline industries. The Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment Committee is anxious to ensure that if in-year
                bidding is necessary, it will be successful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Budget also indicates a decrease in
                EU support for economic development. Approximately £870 million
                of European funding is available to Northern Ireland. The
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee will be interested in
                how this money is allocated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The encouragement of an enterprise culture in
                Northern Ireland is a stated objective of the draft Budget and
                requires new and renewed investment. This is particularly
                relevant at a time of economic uncertainty. The global slow
                down, together with the terrorist events in the United States,
                has already begun to affect Northern Ireland’s foreign and
                direct investment, trade and tourism adversely. It has already
                been noted that the most vulnerable sectors are those exposed to
                global export markets, such as engineering, information and
                communication technology and aerospace. In the current economic
                climate, we must put strategies in place to ensure that the
                economy remains fast-growing and innovative. The Department of
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment and its agencies have
                successfully promoted Northern Ireland as an attractive location
                for inward investment and will continue to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Budget shows that energy efficiency
                and the use of renewable sources will be supported by an
                allocation of £1·9 million. It may be that the greatest
                potential for renewable energy and electricity here will come
                from immature technologies, which will need grant support to
                achieve commercial viability. If this is so — and the
                Committee has seen renewable sources in action — we will wish
                to ensure that the Department bids successfully for additional
                support for renewable energy projects. The Department also made
                a bid for £2 million to enhance the North/South electricity
                interconnector. This was unsuccessful, and it will need to be
                re-submitted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In paragraph 5.7 of the draft Programme for
                Government, recognition of the important role of local councils
                in inward investment is welcome. It is noted that work with
                universities, further education colleges, local councils and the
                private sector will secure investment in 20 knowledge-based
                industries each year. It is not said where they will be located,
                nor is there any reference to TSN in this sub-priority that
                might suggest that priority will be given to sub-regions with
                high levels of unemployment. I ask the Minister to take that
                into account.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In paragraph 5.6, on promoting
                entrepreneurship, innovation and creativity, it is said to be
                expected that</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;local councils will continue, through
                the Business Start Programme, to play a key role, particularly
                in encouraging potential high growth businesses while our
                universities and centres of excellence will play their
                part.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The business start programme aims for 600 new
                business starts by March 2005, and 120 high-technology,
                value-added spin-out and spin-in companies will be formed in
                research-linked incubator units. Twenty new and enhanced centres
                of research excellence will be established by December 2004.
                These centres are clearly expected to have a major impact on the
                future industrial structure of Northern Ireland through spinning
                and start-ups, numbering approximately 700 enterprises over the
                next three years. They will also, no doubt, affect inward
                investment opportunities in their catchment areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 4.7 covers enabling the socially
                excluded to enter the workplace. Reference is made to 1,000
                additional university places. This is most welcome. Travelling
                outside Northern Ireland to study places a heavy financial
                burden on those who must do so. The largest growth in forced
                emigrants has been among those in the less well-qualified
                categories that often correspond with those whose earlier
                educational experience was less adequate. However, local higher
                education places also sustain more local jobs in the higher
                education industry. I ask the Minister to apply TSN to the
                allocation of places to the various centres of learning in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Budget programme for the Department of
                Culture, Arts and Leisure, I note that £1 million has been
                assigned to the development of museums. As this represents an
                important part of the tourist package offered by urban areas,
                and as industrially oriented museums can also support local
                industry, can consideration be given to the establishment of a
                museum in the north-west to celebrate the clothing industry?</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also important to note that the Budget
                provision does not take into account possible major
                infrastructure projects, such as the recently announced natural
                gas pipelines and the provision of broadband telecommunications
                in Northern Ireland. Those will be considered under the
                Executive programme funds, and grants for the gas pipelines will
                probably arise in 2003-04 and 2005-06, not in the current budget
                year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also noted that the Executive have
                identified the areas of regional development, education and
                health as being in need of special support. It is unfortunate
                that due to a lack of resources the introduction of free nursing
                care for the elderly has been deferred. That shows the tough
                decisions that the Executive have had to make and will continue
                to make. I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh mait agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                support the motion and wish to debate some points regarding all
                Departments, not just the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development. Some Members have already mentioned the importance
                of departmental priorities. Members will agree that outcomes
                should be more important than the functioning or costs of a
                Department. That is certainly what those outside the Assembly
                believe. However, the reverse applies. Departments hold dear
                their spending power and sustainability — at the expense of
                everything else that happens beyond their Department and in
                public.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The needs of different areas should be
                regarded by Departments as a higher priority than they are at
                present. There must be a change of mindset in how Departments
                prioritise their bids, what they do with their money after
                receiving their funding and how they spend their money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">West of the Bann, areas such as Fermanagh and
                South Tyrone — indeed all of Tyrone — have always been given
                low priority by all Departments. Investment policy in those
                areas must be examined in the light of recent job losses in
                Fermanagh. How much will be spent on trying to change the
                situation in the likes of Lisnaskea, or will it be forgotten
                about as time passes?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a question for the Department for
                Regional Development concerning roads. Recent meetings with the
                last rotational Minister gave little indication that Fermanagh
                and South Tyrone would be treated with any sort of priority
                compared with urban areas or those that normally receive a high
                level of funding. Members request that funding for public
                transport and rail be dramatically increased in comparison with
                that devoted to roads. That is a very nice environmental policy,
                but those in rural areas do not have an option. The motor car as
                the main form of transport is not just an option there; it is
                essential and will probably be essential for many years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unlikely that any future Budget will
                see a great deal of money being spent on public transport or a
                rail system into the rural areas of Fermanagh and Tyrone in
                particular. It is a non-event; it will not happen. How many
                passengers are brought by public transport — by bus or rail
                — into Belfast city centre on a weekday? How can the system be
                improved to move people out of their cars and on to public
                transport? People have got the wrong end of the stick when they
                start pushing larger amounts of money into public transport at
                the expense of rural areas, particularly where the local people
                will have to depend on their own transport for many years to
                come.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The aggregates tax is an environmental tax
                that exists for the right reasons in the right places, but it is
                an anti-roads policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suggest to the Minister that road projects
                in rural areas need to be prioritised now because there may not
                be the possibility of road budgets in the future. The
                environmental policy will become stricter, and rural areas will
                be given a lower priority, and it may be impossible for rural
                roads to be brought up to the standard of roads in eastern
                areas. Roads in urban areas such as Belfast and Dublin will be
                looked after in the future. I ask that rural areas be
                prioritised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sue Ramsey mentioned that at present the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has a
                standstill budget. That is intolerable. Other Members have
                mentioned the prime importance of health. Individual Members
                have priorities, but health must come above everything. Waiting
                lists must be examined. Cancer sufferers in Fermanagh must
                travel to Belfast to receive treatment where there are long
                waiting lists. That happens on a weekly basis. I was told
                recently that the trusts and boards have no idea how much money
                they are getting to deal with winter pressures and expenses. We
                are close to that critical time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Massive savings could be made through
                providing better community care. Monica McWilliams made the
                point that when cuts are made in community care the cost of
                acute services increases. People have accidents in the home
                because they do not have the proper care, equipment or
                facilities to meet their needs. When care is not given at an
                early stage, the later costs are vast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main priority of rural areas such as
                Fermanagh and South Tyrone is that of overall acute care and the
                sustainability of services. The Hayes review is heading towards
                final decisions and implementation. A large amount of the Budget
                is required to bring those services to the proper standard. Due
                to the lack of consultants wanting to move to those areas, there
                is a real danger that some services will either collapse on to
                one site at Omagh or Enniskillen or will collapse altogether.
                Some people might think that that might be a good thing for
                their particular empire, but it is not something we should look
                forward to. It is important to sustain present services, and we
                need an increased budget to do so. As one Member remarked, it is
                important that health concerns are given priority over
                individual departmental concerns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How is the Budget to be allocated? The
                Department of Finance and Personnel must stop &quot;top
                slicing&quot;. It discriminates against rural areas by giving
                some £1·5 million each to the Southern Health and Social
                Services Board and the Eastern Health and Social Services Board
                at an early stage and dividing the remainder among other areas
                later. That is working against rural areas that are the most
                deprived in the Six Counties. Money must be allocated on an
                equitable basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a particular interest in agriculture
                and most of my concerns have been covered in the vision group’s
                report. The Chairman mentioned that we were all in agreement.
                However, I have not argued exactly the same line. There are
                issues in that document that do not require money and should
                therefore not be allocated for. However, a section of that
                report concerns the important area of rural development. The
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development requires a
                budget that allows it to implement its priorities. It does not
                as yet have such a budget. Which parts of the document does the
                Department intend to implement, given that it does not have a
                budget for that in the coming year?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also a need to work across
                Departments to implement much of it, including planning and
                roads.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been a considerable increase in
                funding for disease control, but, as has already been mentioned,
                much of that funding has been wasted, which may be largely due
                to fraud. I must point out to the Chairman of the Agriculture
                Committee that fraud is not confined to just a few areas, as the
                DUP has been saying recently. That was on a narrow margin
                compared to the £22 million mentioned by Ms McWilliams. There
                are farmers who have made more profit from bringing the disease
                onto their farms than from ordinary farming — not just here
                but also in England, Scotland and Wales. The money could be
                better used in other areas. Why does this happen year after
                year? We should be getting to the point where there is
                eradication, rather than continually pouring money into a
                bottomless pit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Agriculture and Rural
                Development questions the commitment of the British Government
                with regard to their policies on the North/South element. How
                much money is to be spent, for example, on a benchmarking
                exercise to compare business practices here with those in the
                South?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Armstrong mentioned early retirement for
                farmers, and it is feasible under match-funding and even other
                self-financing methods which could be considered. It is vitally
                important that we have new entrants.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not want to face another foot-and-mouth
                disease outbreak. This one has cost the Department very dearly
                in time and in commitment to other issues which it should have
                been getting on with. We need to know how much of the budget
                will be spent on an inquiry. The cost will be considerable, but
                it is necessary if we are to avoid another crisis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development may think that it is not its responsibility, but it
                needs to budget for advice to farmers regarding on-farm audits.
                The citizens advice bureaux provide this service at the moment,
                but do not have adequate funding. Farmers need help to prevent
                debt, and the funding for that should come from the Department
                rather than from local councils, which is ratepayers’ money.
                Certainly the Department could match the funding — that is
                something that is amiss with the bids. I hope that, if not this
                year, perhaps next, that aspect could be considered. Also, the
                issue of women in agriculture could be mainstreamed at some
                point in the future. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is good to take part in a debate such as
                this, particularly when one compares it to the events of this
                morning. Perhaps it is because only the good, sensible and
                important people are left in the Chamber to take part.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fully understand that the Finance Minister
                works under extreme budgetary pressures. I realise that the
                Barnett formula does not give us the expenditure that we in
                Northern Ireland need and to which we are entitled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, with these limitations in mind,
                I can only conclude that this Budget is not what we would wish
                for.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reiterate the comments made by my
                Colleague, Mr Close, and by others that we should get our
                priorities right. As the Alliance Party’s spokesperson on
                health, I want to concentrate on health issues, as many of my
                Colleagues have done. First and foremost, the Budget fails in
                its provision for the Department of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety. There is no increase to help with the very
                serious problems in that Department. Total expenditure may rise
                by 8·1%, but this does not represent an increase in the money
                available for the Health Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Minister’s own words, it includes a
                transfer of expenditure that provides no new spending power for
                the Department. There will be no money available for the
                Department to introduce new service developments. There are many
                needs in the community and, for example, dwindling resources for
                people with learning difficulties throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Commitments that were made in the Programme
                for Government will be left unfulfilled. It is to be regretted
                that the Assembly is now unable to introduce free nursing care
                for the elderly, despite having given its full approval to such
                a scheme some time ago. Who suffers from such a deferral other
                than the senior citizens and frail, sick people? That simply is
                not good enough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This winter will bring the inevitable
                hospital bed crisis — it has already begun. Services will not
                improve, advances will not be made, and the consequences will be
                more pain and suffering caused by extended waiting lists for
                many of our ill constituents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More money must be found, and it must be
                better managed. It must not come from the Minister’s back
                pocket as a result of some underspending. It must be upfront and
                immediate. Also, there must be greater flexibility so that
                health and social service funding can be more effectively and
                efficiently used. This may be a matter for the trusts. However,
                it has already been mentioned in the Chamber. For example, it is
                indefensible that a hospital service should be subject to severe
                additional costs as a result of bed-blocking when relatively
                small amounts of additional expenditure on care-in-the-community
                schemes could relieve the problem. In the Ulster Hospital up to
                70 people are awaiting discharge, but they cannot leave because
                there are no community-care packages. This must improve
                immediately, and I shall be taking this matter up with the
                Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to see the increase in spending
                for the Department for Regional Development. A sum of £8·7
                million is to be used to improve roads. That is something that
                must be done, and we have been calling for it for some time. The
                rural electorate depends upon good roads for access to health
                care. Therefore I am relieved by the commitment to maintain and
                improve roads. I hope that my constituency of Strangford will
                benefit from the increase in funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When does the Minister plan to find the funds
                to implement the commitment that he made a year ago? When does
                he plan to find the money to avert, rather than manage, the
                annual winter health care crisis? When will he produce a Budget
                that will help to improve the health system for everyone? We
                know that our Minister of Health has asked for increased funding
                to provide better health facilities. There are many other
                financial and budgetary concerns, but the quality of our Health
                Service should be our first priority.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a delight to hear local politicians
                debating something sensible after the acrimonious debate this
                morning and especially debating how we spend our money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the increase in the Department of
                the Environment’s budget from £100·8 million to £108·9
                million. That increase is a recognition of the pressures on the
                Department and will, I hope, support the Department in meeting
                its objective of improving the quality of life in Northern
                Ireland by protecting the environment through sustainable
                development and planning policies, promoting efficient local
                government and through improving road safety.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further areas of special scientific interest
                must be designated and staff provided to monitor fully the
                existing sites. More finance is needed for that, otherwise the
                Department’s objective is only fine words.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 12·5% increase in the previous
                expenditure for road safety is also welcomed. Road safety is an
                important part of the Department’s work. The number of
                vehicles on the road increases each year, and there has been a
                1% increase from 1999. Unfortunately, the increase in the number
                of road vehicles has been accompanied by an increase in road
                accidents. During 1999-2000 and 2000-01, road traffic injuries
                increased by 7%, road casualties rose by 5%, and fatalities as a
                result of road accidents rose from 150 to 163. We cannot have
                that. More must be done with increased spending to reduce those
                levels. A sum of £1·4 million was mentioned for road safety.
                However, more money should be spent, with an emphasis on the
                training and education of young persons before they even get
                behind the wheel of a car.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the emphasis on waste management
                and the moneys that have been made available to enable the
                Department of the Environment to continue its programme of waste
                management and pollution control. There is a statement that
                ensures that Northern Ireland continues the work towards meeting
                EU Directives on waste management. The Budget allocation
                provides the Department with an additional £3·4 million on the
                previous Budget. However, I am concerned that £1·6 million has
                been reallocated from departmental resources to meet new
                pressures in that area. It sounds like robbing Peter to pay
                Paul.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Provision has been made for local government
                services to meet fully the cost of councils’ de-rating
                policies and to provide resource grants to poorer councils.
                However, because of EU Directives, there is a reduction of £2
                million in that grant. That reduction will be acutely felt in my
                constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone. The resource grant
                for Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council will be reduced
                by £109,000; Fermanagh District Council’s grant will be
                reduced by £127,000.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That will inevitably lead to a domestic and
                non- domestic rate increase and will put more pressure on
                councils, on the commerce of the area and on the residents. That
                will be most unwelcome, because my constituents in that area are
                already under great economic pressure due to the differential in
                the exchange rate with the Republic of Ireland. That
                differential has hit petrol stations, the quarry industry and
                the textile industry. They have all felt it greatly. I shall not
                mention agriculture because it has already been debated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fermanagh has been particularly hard hit
                because of substantial job losses over the past year. The
                Department documented £0·9 million for planning; I expect that
                that is for ongoing planning pressures. However, I ask the
                Department to find more money to co-ordinate planning policies
                across Northern Ireland so that there is a similar approach to
                planning permission in all areas. I hope that these points are
                considered, and I welcome the opportunity to put them forward.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Regional
                Development (Mr A Maginness):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee welcomes the significant
                increase of £42 million — representing 8% from 2001-02 — in
                the Department for Regional Development’s budget. That
                increase is a recognition of the years of underfunding that have
                occurred in our roads, water and public transport. Poor
                infrastructure has had an adverse affect on many aspects of our
                lives, and the situation will be rectified only through the
                provision of proper levels of sustained funding. This increase
                is a recognition that this must be done and that it will be
                done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The importance of our infrastructure cannot
                be overestimated. The road network is critical to our economy.
                Ninety-nine per cent of Northern Ireland’s goods are
                transported by road. A well-maintained road network reduces the
                time taken to transport freight. That in turn helps to improve
                business profitability, competitiveness and efficiency.
                Improvements in the road system will also help to reduce the
                number of road accidents; something that we all acknowledge is
                unacceptably high.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Regional Development Committee welcomed
                the announcement by the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister that an additional £40 million will be
                made available for the trans-European network routes, Larne to
                Belfast and Newry to Dundalk, as well as a significant
                contribution to the upgrading of the Westlink. That is very
                important, not just for Belfast but for the whole Northern
                Ireland economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee would like to see the targeting
                of similar funding at other trans-European network routes in
                Northern Ireland, particularly those in areas not serviced by
                the rail network. I accept Gerry McHugh’s point that parts of
                this region look longingly at the money given to the development
                of the railway network.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Improved public transport helps to ease
                congestion by making people less dependent on their cars, and
                the extension and improvement of cycle lanes provides a
                healthier option than driving. Furthermore, reliable and
                accessible public transport will make a positive contribution to
                the promotion of social inclusion — a key priority of the
                Executive. This is particularly noticeable in rural areas where
                up to 30% of households do not have access to a motor vehicle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Undoubtedly, investment in our water
                pipelines and sewerage systems will help to improve water
                quality and to avoid health risks such as the cryptosporidium
                outbreaks experienced in the past two years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could mention many other benefits, but I do
                not want to take up the House’s time by reciting a long list.
                However, I seek to explain the importance and benefits of a
                properly funded and maintained infrastructure to all of Northern
                Ireland society. Page 39 of the draft Programme for Government
                states:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The provision of infrastructure and
                major public services such as public transport, roads, water and
                sewerage is essential for the social and economic well being of
                the region.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fully endorse that. The Regional
                Development Committee wholeheartedly agrees with this statement.
                Improving our infrastructure must be a key priority for
                Government. There still exists an approximate £100 million
                backlog in road maintenance, while the Water Service also
                requires major capital investment to update the pipelines and
                sewerage systems. If we are to achieve our objective of a
                socially inclusive society, we must provide an efficient,
                accessible and affordable public transportation system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a positive step towards that goal, the
                Executive have earmarked £48 million in 2002-03 for the
                purchase of new train sets.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As with roads and water services, investment
                in the public transportation system is playing catch-up after
                many years of underinvestment. New train sets will undoubtedly
                make train travel more appealing, and the proposed Railway
                Safety Bill will help to ensure high standards. We cannot be
                complacent; there is much more to be done if rail travel is to
                become a major form of commuter transport. More money must be
                invested in train sets and in the improvement of access and
                facilities. The same is true of our buses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By encouraging commuters out of their cars
                and into trains and buses, we shall alleviate congestion,
                particularly in the Belfast metropolitan area, as well as
                contribute to the economy and the environment. A reliable and
                efficient bus network is especially critical to those people who
                live in rural areas. There are genuine concerns that rural bus
                services may be significantly reduced if private operators
                continue to target the more profitable routes, thus forcing
                Translink to reduce services on the less profitable rural
                routes. Consequently, the Committee for Regional Development
                encourages Government to provide additional funding to improve
                the Northern Ireland bus fleet and to aim at reducing the
                average age of buses in line with the UK target.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Regional Development is
                conscious of the funding pressures on the Northern Ireland
                block, and it believes that new approaches to funding should be
                considered. The possibility of leasing trains for public
                transportation and the development of the railway network should
                be considered. The Committee knows of leasing arrangements in
                the UK. If leasing were introduced, it would release funds for
                investment in other infrastructure improvements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that health expenditure has increased
                by about 8%. That represents more than 40% of the Budget.
                However, standards are falling; we see underperformance in
                practically every area of the Health Service. The public should
                know why that is happening in spite of the fact that health
                services receive the largest share of the Budget and have
                received an increase in spending. There must be an explanation;
                it cannot simply be the lack of funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are 19 trusts in an area with a
                population equivalent to that of Greater Birmingham. Is that the
                most efficient way to administer the Health Service? Does that
                not prevent the efficiencies that we desire? Does that not eat
                up valuable money and resources that we need to apply to health
                and to other areas? I have no answers to those questions.
                However, I pose the question that people are asking — if so
                much money is spent on health, why do we not see the results?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee of the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise for my poor attendance at this
                debate. I may be unable to stay because a school in my
                constituency has been threatened with closure, and there is a
                meeting about that tonight.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee of the Centre scrutinised the
                draft Budget at the beginning of October and has discussed
                several concerns with the junior Ministers. The concerns centred
                on the approach that the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister had adopted towards the bidding process
                and the inadequate funding of several important programmes. The
                Committee noted that the draft Budget that was presented to the
                Assembly on 25 September had been developed in the context of
                the priorities and principles of the Programme for Government.
                The Committee is not convinced that the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister will be able to deliver
                on its Programme for Government priorities with the funding in
                the draft Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the discussion with the junior
                Ministers, the Committee was advised that much of the work of
                the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                is of a cross-cutting nature and deals with many sensitive
                issues. The Committee endorses that assessment, but it adds to
                our concerns about the Office’s ability to make progress on
                work in many high priority areas. There should have been a more
                vigorous approach to bidding to secure baseline funding, at
                least, for the children’s commissioner post, the review of
                public administration and the implementation of the cross-
                departmental strategy for the promotion of community relations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Budget provides for increases in
                expenditure in five areas: £300,000 for work on the Single
                Equality Bill; £200,000 for the Civic Forum; £200,000 for the
                Northern Ireland Bureau in Washington; £100,000 for TSN
                research and evaluation; and £100,000 for the establishment of
                a new strategic issues unit. The Committee questions the
                priority given to several of those areas and the benefits that
                that additional funding will provide. We also question whether
                the right balance has been struck between those and other high
                priorities, such as the Economic Policy Unit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee was concerned to learn, during
                the discussions with the junior Ministers, that the draft Budget
                did not contain sufficient provision for an increase in the cost
                of running the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister. There will be a shortfall of about £200,000. The
                Committee was advised that, in order to meet the costs, the
                Department would, in the first instance, consider the outcome of
                the ongoing staff review. The Committee welcomes that. However,
                the Minister should explain how the pressure will be dealt with.
                For example, the cost of the children’s commissioner is
                estimated to be between £1 million and £2 million. The review
                of public administration may cost £2 million, and a second
                permanent secretary post for the Office of the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister has recently been advertised. How
                will those costs be met without cuts in high-priority
                programmes?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government gives a target
                date of June 2002 for appointment to the post of children’s
                commissioner, but the Budget does not contain any funding for
                it. The junior Ministers said that they might be able to get
                money from the Executive programme funds. However, a
                considerable proportion of those funds has already been used in
                the Budget, and any funding that might have been expected to
                come from the Executive programme funds is already accounted
                for.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past, substantial Executive programme
                funds came from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment as a result of the declining need for large-scale
                investment in attracting jobs. However, because of the worldwide
                downturn in the economy and the effect of the events of 11
                September, that money may not be available to the same extent,
                and the Executive programme funds will come under greater
                pressure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The need for a children’s commissioner may
                not be considered to be so great if there is less money
                available from the Executive programme funds. There are also
                continuing needs in the Health Service that will have to be
                dealt with. I want to highlight that potential problem now. The
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister has
                not presented the case for funding for the children’s
                commissioner post well enough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the outset of the Assembly, when 11
                Departments were created, a radical review of public
                administration was promised to offset the cost of having five
                additional Departments. We were promised root and branch reform,
                that the quangos would be cut to an absolute minimum and that
                the core issues would be examined. However, we have dragged on
                and on, and, to date, we have no funding set aside for the
                review of public administration. How can we have a proper review
                if we do not dedicate any resources to it? That issue will not
                be dealt with in the Assembly’s lifetime. However, it must be
                dealt with — a radical review of public administration is
                important for the credibility of this institution, although it
                does not have much credibility at the moment. We want those
                programmes to begin without further delay.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee was pleased to learn that a
                late bid of £750,000 for Executive programme funds for victims
                was lodged after we raised the matter with the Ministers. It was
                alarming that the Committee knew that a second tranche of
                Executive programme funds was available, of which neither of the
                Ministers appeared to be aware. It was only when the Committee
                raised the matter with the Ministers that the bid was lodged. I
                hope that it is successful. The victims’ unit needs support;
                it is a big issue, and we want the victims to get as much
                support as possible.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, you have the honour to listen to
                the rest of us. I acknowledge the efforts of Mr Leslie on behalf
                of his Committee. Those efforts have resulted in a more
                satisfactory amount of time being made available for Committees
                to consider this important matter in detail and to carry out
                their statutory duties. I hope that similar arrangements are put
                in place for the next round of Executive programme funds. I ask
                the Minister to comment on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Committee welcomes the additional £20
                million allocated to education over and above the original
                indicative figures. That represents a real increase of 4·8% on
                this year, which will enable most, but not all, the inescapable
                education bids to be met. My Committee has considered proposals
                from the Department of Education to cover those inescapable bids
                that have not been met. Those amount to £4·6 million. In
                general, my Committee supports the proposals. However, it does
                not wish to see a reduction in the maintenance budget for
                schools for longer than a year, as that would have an adverse
                effect and, in the longer term, could lead to increased capital
                costs. As Members are aware, we already face a huge
                capital-building problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that the Executive acknowledge
                that, as education is one of the services faced with the most
                difficulties, it must be given high priority. My Committee
                believes that education must be given top priority because it is
                a foundation for a strong, vibrant and growing economy in
                Northern Ireland and that funding it is a long-term investment
                in the future of Northern Ireland. The pressures that schools
                face are very great, and therefore the proposals in the draft
                Budget are essential.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Education Committee wishes to highlight
                that this funding enables schools to meet only identified,
                inescapable pressures, and to mark time. It does not provide any
                scope to improve or expand services, which is a concern. We are
                also concerned that some schools appear to be struggling on an
                ongoing basis and are not receiving the core funding necessary
                to provide essential services and the core curriculum for all
                pupils. This was a recurring theme during evidence taken by the
                Education Committee in respect of the primary and post-primary
                funding arrangements.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee will therefore be looking for a
                substantial increase to improve school budgets in the next
                comprehensive spending review. In my view that will also be
                crucial if the reviews of LMS funding and post-primary education
                are to be brought forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Education Committee is firmly of the view
                that early learning, early intervention initiatives and capital
                building investment must continue to be given a high priority
                for funding. The draft Budget will enable the pre-school
                initiative to continue, but it does not allow for expansion or
                improvement beyond what was already scheduled to take place.
                Members found that extremely disappointing. Similarly, the small
                increase for capital spending will not allow swift progress in
                addressing the problems with school buildings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the amount of money spent on education
                administration, the Committee is concerned that there has been
                no clarification, or detailed timescale, produced for the review
                of public administration; a point touched on by other Members.
                The Executive must take this forward as a top priority, and the
                review must begin as quickly as possible to enable important
                decisions to be taken urgently. The Committee believes that an
                evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of all non-school
                activities must be carried out to ensure that the Department of
                Education focuses on the key priorities. The Committee also
                recommends that further work be carried out to establish clearer
                links between public- service agreement and service-delivery
                agreement targets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recent assurance given by the Minister of
                Finance and Personnel to the Assembly that he remains determined
                to seek improvements to the Barnett formula is welcome. The
                application of the formula has had a significant affect on the
                allocation of money to schools, and it raises issues of basic
                equality. Northern Ireland schools perceive that they are being
                treated less favourably than schools in England, and this must
                be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Education Committee welcomes the extra
                funding for education provided in the draft Budget. This is
                clearly in line with the Programme for Government priorities and
                is an investment in the future of our children and our economy.
                However, we are disappointed that this level of real funding
                will enable schools and education initiatives to meet only
                existing pressures, and to mark time. It will not enable
                improvement or expansion of the services to take place. However,
                we endorse the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety (Dr Hendron):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are witnessing the slow disintegration of
                important aspects of the Health Service in Northern Ireland, and
                previous speakers have mentioned that. The morale of patients
                and staff is at an all-time low. Waiting lists are increasing,
                and the unacceptable practice of patients being placed on
                trolleys continues. In many areas, service availability fails to
                meet demand. Recently Monica McWilliams and I visited the Ulster
                Hospital’s accident and emergency and intensive care units,
                and we were appalled at what we saw. Patients were on trolleys
                and sitting on chairs. No more trolleys were available, and that
                was a daily occurrence. Staff members were under so much
                pressure that they could not deal adequately with patients.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The position is the same at accident and
                emergency departments throughout Northern Ireland. If extra
                funding is not found, then the closure of accident and emergency
                departments at times is a distinct possibility in the future.
                The Royal Victoria Hospital is the main trauma hospital for
                Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland there is meant to be cover
                for major trauma every day, seven days a week. A senior
                consultant recently told me that there is now only adequate
                cover every other 24 hours. I cannot go into details, but that
                is a serious situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Elective surgery is being cancelled routinely
                in many hospitals because of a shortage of beds. There is also a
                chronic shortage of specialist theatre nurses in areas such as
                orthopaedics and neurology, with the resulting cancellations of
                theatre lists. Cancer patients are regularly inconvenienced by
                the breakdown of old equipment at Belvoir Park Hospital, and the
                funding has not yet been identified for the planned regional
                cancer centre at Belfast City Hospital. The saga of the planned
                regional maternity hospital also continues, even though the
                Jubilee was closed and demolished some time ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is greatly concerned that the
                annual percentage increases in health spending over the next two
                years are over 2% less than those in England. In 2002-03 the
                figure is 7·2% as opposed to 9·3%, and in 2003-04 it is 5·4%
                as opposed to 8%. The bulk of costs are driven by developments
                in England, such as in the areas of pay, drugs and clinical and
                other standards. Unless there is match-funding, there will be a
                continuing deterioration in the levels of service here compared
                to those in England.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">None of the figures takes into account the
                higher levels of need and demand in Northern Ireland, compared
                to those in England. My Committee fully supported the Minister
                of Health in her bid for an extra £122 million, and it is
                greatly concerned that only £31·6 million was allocated.
                Although it was hoped that the latter figure would cover
                essential expenditure, it is now apparent that the cost of
                junior doctors’ pay will be £3·5 million more than was
                estimated, and that the care cost for people with learning
                disabilities will be an extra £2 million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The total inescapable bids are therefore £37
                million — some £5 million short of what has been allocated.
                The remaining £91 million was to be for developments to help
                the Health Service to maintain its current levels. It has been
                noted by the Committee that the overall spending for 2002-03 is
                proportionately on a par with the current year. There is not,
                therefore, a proportionate increase in the health share of the
                Northern Ireland block, despite the ever increasing demands. In
                his Budget speech to the Assembly on 25 September, the Minister
                of Finance said that the Executive had come</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;to the view that health, education and
                roads were among the services that face the most acute
                difficulties&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I pay tribute to the Minister and his
                Colleagues for giving that emphasis. Nevertheless, while I
                appreciate that all Departments need more money, it is time for
                all of us — and for the Executive in particular — to sit up
                and look at the current situation in the Health Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are concerned that the draft Budget will
                do nothing to reverse the increase in waiting lists. It is
                alarming to note that the recent draft Programme for Government
                has a target, by March 2003, to maintain the waiting lists at
                the March 2002 level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one knows what the latter figure will be,
                so it is not possible for my Committee to accept such a target.
                The trend is upwards — the latest figure is 54,000. The first
                Programme for Government, published earlier this year, had a
                figure of 48,000. That was to be reduced to 39,000 by March
                2004. Clearly, that target will not be met, bearing in mind the
                current spending proposals for the next two years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another major problem is the bed-blocking
                system. There is no extra money to provide sufficient community-
                care packages. With an average stay per patient, other than for
                those requiring community-care packages, of approximately seven
                days, it is estimated that the waiting list could be reduced by
                at least 7,500 per year if that problem could be solved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that my Colleague, Alban
                Maginness, talked about the structures of the Health Service.
                There has also been talk about the review of public
                administration. We have raised that issue here before. The
                review of public administration seems to be years away. The
                Health Service cannot wait that long. I urge not only the
                Minister present, but the Executive, to co-operate and encourage
                the Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety at
                least to take an initial look at the structures of the Health
                Service. Our Committee persuaded Dr Maurice Hayes in his acute
                hospitals report to look at those structures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point has already been made that there
                are 19 trusts for a population the size of Greater Birmingham.
                The Committee also believes that free personal care for the
                elderly should be made available. It is most concerned therefore
                to note that, not only is this service not to be provided, but
                that free nursing care is to be deferred. With the prospect of
                even fewer available resources in 2003-04, it appears that free
                nursing care could be a long way off.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already mentioned the regional cancer
                centre. We all know the number of people in Northern Ireland who
                are dying of cancer. Cancer death rates will soon be higher than
                coronary artery disease death rates. We have had a number of
                meetings with people from Belfast City Hospital and Belvoir Park
                Hospital. We have visited both centres; we visited Belvoir Park
                Hospital quite recently, and I sympathise with the Minister of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety regarding funding for
                Belvoir Park Hospital. It is going to take three years to build
                the dedicated regional cancer centre. In the meantime, should
                the Minister spend money on it, or should she wait for the new
                unit in Belfast City Hospital? It will take three years to build
                the new unit in Belfast City Hospital, but that is three years
                from the date when the financial package is worked out. I
                understand that that package has not yet been worked out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monica McWilliams made reference to the
                infrastructure funds. In our last meeting with the Minister, we
                put great emphasis on those funds. Over the next couple of
                years, £51 million should be made available. I therefore hope
                that those funds will be used, and that all Ministers in the
                Executive will support the Minister of Health, Social Services
                and Public Services in freeing those funds for the building of
                that cancer centre for all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I mentioned free personal care for the
                elderly. There is also a great need to find funding for many
                facilities and services, including £1·1 billion for the
                implementation of the acute hospitals review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members of my Committee and I are unhappy
                with the whole overview of health spending. I appreciate the
                massive job that the Minister and her Department have to do. We
                understand that, but I sometimes get the feeling that with all
                the boards and trusts, people seem to be going round in circles.
                Of course there is a huge shortage of funding, but it is
                difficult to see how people’s health would be improved even if
                funding were increased. Our Committee has discussed whether we
                should ask the Comptroller and Auditor General for Northern
                Ireland to examine the Health Service in that regard. I am not
                sure that we have the right to do that, but we have asked our
                Clerk to look into that matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even if the Department’s budget bid of
                £122 million had been fully met, the standard of service for
                the people of Northern Ireland would be lower that that to be
                provided in Scotland and England. With only £31·6 million
                being provided for 2002-03, the service must fall even further
                behind here. Our Committee is therefore concerned that whatever
                extra funding for health is announced in England, the Northern
                Ireland share does not go directly to the Health Service here.
                It is redistributed through the Northern Ireland block, and
                invariably the full amount is not allocated to health. There is
                a question mark over that; I am sure the Minister will clarify
                the matter. This would result in Northern Ireland falling
                further and further behind comparable standards of service. I
                respectfully ask the Minister and his Colleagues in the
                Executive to declare that the Health Service is the number-one
                priority in Northern Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Social Development
                Committee (Mr Cobain):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">James Leslie said at the beginning of the
                debate that, along with other Committees, the Social Development
                Committee formally responded to the Finance and Personnel
                Committee on the draft Budget for next year. The element of the
                draft Budget with which we are specifically concerned is the
                suggested overall increase by 8·6% in the Department for Social
                Development’s budget. On the face of it, such an increase is
                not bad, until you note that the departmental running costs will
                have increased by almost 12% this year. The disparity in these
                increases seems inappropriate, given that the Department’s aim
                is to tackle social disadvantage and build communities.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Social Security Agency provides
                front-line services, and the Committee acknowledges the
                difficult role it plays, but we are concerned about the
                continued increase in its running costs. The administration of
                the benefits system should run smoothly, and those who are
                entitled to benefits should receive the correct level of
                financial support at the right time. The Committee has been told
                that the agency required short-term investment to make
                efficiency savings through measures that would also improve
                levels of service. I hope that the increase for next year will
                lead to efficiency savings, and the Committee has urged the
                Department for Social Development to ensure that it does.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly will not be surprised to learn
                that the Committee has again felt the need to register concerns
                about the proposed allocation of funding to tackle fuel poverty
                and housing needs. The Warm Homes Scheme is a one-off capital
                cost. It has no recurring implications. If it were to be
                properly and urgently funded, it would have positive effects not
                only on the standard of housing, but on people’s health and
                well-being. There would be consequential savings for the
                Department of Health. I urge the Minister of Finance and
                Personnel and his colleagues on the Executive to think long and
                hard about that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive and the Assembly claim to be
                working for the most marginalised in our community, and towards
                equality. Are those who live in social housing not among the
                most marginalised in this society — do they not deserve help?
                Is it right that people in social housing should have to endure
                longer waiting lists for the replacement of Economy 7 and room
                heaters? Is it right that kitchen and bathroom replacement work
                should be deferred because of a shortfall in the budget? I do
                not think so, and neither do my colleagues on the Social
                Development Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should not overlook the fact that my
                colleagues on the Committee come from parties other than mine.
                Like me, they have constituents to answer to. Our opinions might
                differ in some regards, but we are united in the view that the
                housing element of the Department for Social Development’s
                budget must not be allowed to decline. Constituents who are
                already socially excluded and disadvantaged will remain so if
                this Budget is adopted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much has been made of the housing strategy
                for North Belfast, the constituency of three Social Development
                Committee members and the recently reinstalled Minister for
                Social Development. However, no provision for that strategy is
                made in the draft Budget. That concerns us all, and the
                Committee has drawn the matter to the attention of the Finance
                and Personnel Committee. Recently, the former Minister for
                Social Development, Mr Morrow, made a statement in Belfast
                Castle in which he promised that the £137 million for the North
                Belfast strategy had already been acquired. That does not seem
                to be the case. I urge the Minister for Finance and Personnel to
                ensure that that money is made available over the next six or
                seven years to regenerate what was described by an independent
                survey as &quot;the worst housing in western Europe.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome back Mr Dodds to his ministerial
                position, and I assure him that the Committee will continue to
                press him on this and other issues. He can also expect to rely
                on our support in his bid for a decent housing programme. During
                his opening remarks, the Deputy Chairperson of the Finance and
                Personnel Committee also mentioned the Executive programme funds
                and the continued lack of consultation in that regard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I raised that matter with the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in April. In a
                written reply to AQO 1345/00 I was assured that there would be
                proper and early consultation. Clearly, that did not happen. I
                accept that we can and should be proactive in encouraging the
                Department, but the Committee should not get into the game of
                putting together detailed proposals. We do not have the
                resources to do that, and it is not our role. However, had the
                Social Development Committee been consulted, we would have
                encouraged, indeed urged, the Social Development Minister to
                seek Executive programme funds to tackle fuel poverty more
                extensively and to address the growing problem of homelessness.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Deputy Chairperson of the
                Finance and Personnel Committee on tabling the motion, the
                Committee members on their efforts, and the Minister of Finance
                and Personnel and the Executive for consulting the House on the
                stages of the draft Budget and the draft Programme for
                Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to be able to discuss the draft
                Budget today in spite of the attempts on Friday by a small
                minority of Members to derail the institutions and to subvert
                the will of the people. In the words of the draft Programme for
                Government, the thrust of this Budget is to &quot;make a
                difference&quot;, and the Budget lives up to that commitment in
                many key areas. I will comment on a few issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I welcome back Mr PeterRobinson as the
                Minister for Regional Development. I hope that this time he will
                be allowed to stay in office for as long as the previous
                incumbent, his Colleague MrCampbell. In general I welcome the
                increase by 14·8% in the allocated budget for the Department
                and the planned expenditure of £538million on roads, transport,
                water, and sewerage infrastructure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During direct rule the North’s
                infrastructure was developed unevenly and was concentrated
                primarily in the north-east of the region. That has led to a
                sense of social exclusion and an infrastructural deficit in
                other parts of NorthernIreland. Now that we have devolved power,
                the improvement of the North’s infrastructure must take place
                in a balanced fashion throughout the region, so that all of our
                citizens have equal access to good quality roads, transport,
                water and sewerage services, and also to develop the
                competitiveness of the region’s economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that an additional £8·7million
                will be made available to the roads programme to avoid any
                reductions in planned service levels and to compensate for the
                effects of the aggregates tax. The capital schemes to improve
                some key strategic routes are also welcome. That is vital in
                attracting inward investment, enabling local firms to expand and
                enhancing safety for motorists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The improvements to the A4 between
                Ballygawley and Dungannon, a trans-European network status
                (TENS) road, which will be financed by the Executive programme
                funds, are most welcome. However, I remind the Department that
                other important routes should not be overlooked, such as the
                M2/A5 TENS road, which should also be upgraded. In the
                constituency of West Tyrone, we have neither a mile of motorway
                nor a mile of dual carriageway.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the £48million for the
                purchase of new railway rolling stock. The railway network in
                Northern Ireland has suffered from serious underinvestment for
                many years, and that has compromised efficiency, passenger
                comfort and safety.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that the Department for
                Employment and Learning’s budget will increase by 6·1%. I
                welcome, in particular, the additional £37·3million that is
                designed to increase the number of further and higher education
                places, as it is important for the development of the economy
                that we encourage more students to remain in NorthernIreland.
                The additional money allocated to higher and further education
                and student support includes resources to provide for the
                expansion of further and higher education places. It will also
                promote access to these sectors through improved student support
                measures that target those on low incomes and those in need of
                additional assistance, such as childcare support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Improvement in the skills level of the
                workforce is important to create a vibrant economy, but it is
                also important to ensure that resources are properly targeted so
                that people such as the long-term unemployed are not exploited.
                Therefore I welcome the Minister’s recent decision to conduct
                a review into the individual learning account (ILA) scheme which
                is open to possible exploitation by some unscrupulous ILA
                providers. Owing to the large number of adults in the North who
                lack basic literacy and numeracy skills, it is important that we
                implement a skills programme that encourages lifelong learning
                — it must be properly resourced and targeted to those most in
                need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned that the planned budget for
                the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment for 2002-03
                will decrease by 1·6%, especially given the effects of the
                events of 11 September on Northern Ireland’s aerospace
                industry and the general economic slow down that we are
                experiencing. However, I am pleased that the Executive have
                given a clear commitment to increase investment significantly
                should the need or opportunity arise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the planned increase of 3% in
                the Department of Finance and Personnel’s expenditure. It is
                important for the Department to be properly resourced so that it
                can provide effectively for the range of services to other
                Departments. The commitment to complete the major reviews of
                promotion and recruitment to senior positions in the Civil
                Service, a review of accommodation policy and the
                decentralisation of Civil Service jobs is particularly welcome.
                The decentralisation of Civil Service jobs, as I have said here,
                is something which the SDLP has consistently lobbied for over
                the past two years. The SDLP believes that the Executive should
                lead by example and relocate entire sections of Departments from
                Belfast to other main urban hubs. Such a policy would help to
                achieve more balanced growth beyond Greater Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the overall 7% increase on
                departmental spending programmes compared with 2001-02. I have
                some concern about the £48 million earmarked spending within
                departmental budget plans but which is coming from anticipated
                monitoring-round reviews which take place quarterly. There is
                concern that some double accounting has gone on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned about the £2 million cut
                in local government spending for the incoming year, particularly
                about how it affects some district councils. There is concern
                among some of them. Smaller councils are particularly concerned
                that they are expected to bear significant cuts in their central
                government contribution. Based on last year’s percentage local
                government grant, Omagh District Council will suffer to the tune
                of £109,000, Strabane District Council, also in my
                constituency, will lose to the tune of £120,000, and some of
                the other smaller councils will lose between £65,000 and
                £100,000. Many of the smaller councils have a low district
                rates base of revenue income. It would be bad if some of them
                were to lose out now when we are trying to implement New TSN.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that the draft Budget
                provides for a 3% increase in overall departmental expenditure
                and that the Executive have made a commitment to ensure that New
                TSN will affect policy decisions across all Departments. New TSN
                and the statutory equality legislation are essential tools which
                should inform spending decisions in the 11 Departments and
                ensure that all Departments deliver upon commitments given in
                the draft Programme for Government to create a cohesive,
                inclusive and economically vibrant society.</p>

                contribute to the debate. It is a valuable way of hearing and
                considering the issues that concern all Members in relation to
                next year’s spending plans. I am sure that those who have
                taken part in the debate, and all those who contributed at
                Committee level, will join me in thanking the Committee for
                Finance and Personnel for the efforts it has made, and will
                continue to make, in drawing all those issues together, not
                least those that were raised during today’s debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Budget was developed to deliver the
                Programme for Government. The allocation of resources proposed
                in the draft has been designed to secure the objectives and
                priorities of the programme. I have listened carefully to the
                contributions made to the debate, just as I listened carefully
                to the points that were made to me in questions after my
                original statement. With my Colleagues in the Executive I will
                reflect on the issues and concerns raised by Members today and
                also in the long-term consultative feedback that we will
                continue to receive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will also look at any constructive
                suggestions that have been made, particularly at Committee
                level. When the Committee for Finance and Personnel prepares its
                conclusions it will find those suggestions helpful in reaching a
                better understanding of the full range of opinions that have
                been expressed in the Assembly and in Committees. I look forward
                to the report and to the Committee reaching conclusions and
                recommendations based on the exhortations the Assembly has heard
                today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members referred to the fact that we
                produced the draft Budget earlier this year than last, allowing
                more time for consideration. We also used the Executive position
                report to set out many issues and questions for the Assembly and
                the Committees. It was also made available for public
                consultation. The Executive position report was exactly the same
                document that was made available to the Executive, to the
                Assembly and to the wider public within days of Ministers
                receiving it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The process has been more open and
                transparent than it was before, and that is only partly due to
                the shift of dates for the draft Budget. In future, Executive
                position reports could benefit from Committees focusing more
                sharply than they were able to this year on the issues that have
                been reflected here. Many of those questions were not particular
                to each Committee. Many concerned key priorities for all
                Committees to address. I hope Members will reflect on the points
                that they have recommended to Ministers. They should not simply
                look to their own Departments but to the full range of services
                and broader range of responsibilities of the Assembly and its
                Committees in their consideration of these matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The revised Budget will be introduced on 3
                December 2001. It will include some clarification and adjustment
                of the figures that go with the territory in an exercise such as
                the draft Budget. The Executive will consider whether changes
                could be made to improve the balance between spending areas. The
                views of the Assembly are important. However, with a fixed
                departmental expenditure limit, any increase will be offset by a
                corresponding decrease. All of us need to examine departmental
                planning figures for savings that could be redeployed. It is an
                important principle that money not required for the purpose for
                which it was originally allocated should be made available for
                reallocation by the Executive and the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to use our limited resources in the
                best possible way and ensure that action is taken to improve
                efficiency and effectiveness. Actions must be targeted on a
                priority basis; a fact constantly emphasised in the Programme
                for Government and in the Budget. I am glad that it is
                increasingly being emphasised in the Chamber, and that people
                are not questioning us on what we are trying to do but on
                whether we are succeeding and if we are trying hard enough. That
                is the focus the Assembly should be bringing to bear on these
                issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to work together to maximise our
                advantage — if such it is — in relation to the Treasury. We
                must also ensure that lessons learnt from the audit process are
                used to improve value for money, as several Members have already
                mentioned. It is important that Committees follow up on areas
                that the Public Accounts Committee has highlighted as requiring
                room for improvement. That would ensure more joined-up scrutiny
                as we move towards the audit and accountability legislation. It
                would ensure that areas that, as Ms McWilliams said, have been
                the subject of a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General,
                and which have in turn been considered by the Public Accounts
                Committee, are factored into our Budget considerations and that
                the reports are not just disappearing. It would show that we are
                checking that the recommendations are being followed. The
                Department of Finance and Personnel is meant to monitor the
                situation, but there is room for improvement and joining up the
                scrutiny role of the Executive. Departments may not welcome
                that, but it would be helpful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that Members appreciate that the
                Executive have to be convinced that the benefits of any proposed
                changes will outweigh the sacrifices that have to be made in
                other service areas. Many Members have said that there should be
                only one priority and have then proceeded to speak about others.
                They have welcomed the bigger increases that other Departments
                have received compared with the Department that they were
                complaining about. When speaking about priorities we need to be
                using that word more in the singular if we are to be serious
                about our efforts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are working in a relatively benign
                context. Mr Leslie referred to the departmental expenditure
                limits (DEL) as set by the Treasury, which show a rise for
                2002-03 of 5·8%, or around 3% above general inflation. I
                recognise — and several Members have mentioned — that many
                of the costs that affect public services are rising at a much
                faster rate than general inflation. No one can make a special
                claim, and it should be no political boast for the Executive or
                myself, when some of these costs rise at a much faster rate than
                general inflation. The same argument applies equally when people
                make a case for inflation-busting rate increases because those
                increases are to support the additional expenditure on public
                services that we need. If people are saying that inflation
                should be the rule of thumb in one area it is very difficult if
                they then insist that it has to be disregarded and treated as
                irrelevant in another. There is more consistency in the
                Executive’s approach to this matter compared with some of the
                people who are criticising us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The allocations for next year build on what
                was a 5·5% real-terms increase in 2001-02. Departments have
                been able to initiate important work in the Programme for
                Government. As I stated in my draft Budget statement, we cannot
                expect spending to continue to rise at that rate for much
                longer. The type of scenario that we have been in has been as
                good as it gets. I would like to be able to claim credit for
                this and say that the significant increase has happened while I
                was Minister of Finance and Personnel. However, it is fortuitous
                that my term of office and the Executive’s work on the last
                two Budgets has coincided with what the spending review has
                given us. As we move into a spending review next year and see
                global economic conditions recovering from what they were prior
                to 11September, but even more uncertainly since then, we must
                recognise that the choices will become harder. Making a real
                meaning out of priorities will become more testing for us as an
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members referred to issues relating
                to the Executive programme funds (EPFs). In opening the debate,
                Mr Leslie referred to the Finance and Personnel Committee’s
                report on EPFs. The EPFs are the key means by which the
                Executive are determined to break away from the spending
                patterns that they inherited. We must try to ensure that
                resources are targeted in line with the Executive’s strategic
                priorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people are unconvinced by the evidence,
                but EPFs are designed to promote cross-cutting working in line
                with the Programme for Government’s priorities. I agree with
                observations that were made by some Members, notably Dr Birnie,
                that we must do more to promote interdepartmental co-operation
                in the delivery of services, and that must be reflected in the
                way in which we plan EPFs. I accept the point made by the
                Committee and others that we must ensure that the processes for
                managing and allocating the funds are as effective and efficient
                as possible. Simply throwing open EPF bids to Committees at an
                earlier stage will not necessarily be the best, or the only, way
                to do that if it just adds to the mono-departmental-focus
                syndrome that some people claim already exists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must look at whether we are using the
                right substructure or processes at Executive level to ensure
                that a cross-cutting priority comes through in planning. I have
                received a helpful report on EPFs from the Committee for Finance
                and Personnel, and my Executive Colleagues and I will consider
                it before responding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members of the Committee for
                Agriculture, especially the Chairperson, Dr Paisley, asked about
                provision for the findings of the vision group. The draft Budget
                does not include any additional resources for the provisions in
                the vision report. That is because the public consultation
                process on the report will continue until the end of December.
                After the consultation process, the Minister will publish a plan
                of action for the strategic development of the agrifood
                industry. At that stage, firm bids for the implementation of the
                report’s recommendations can be developed and considered with
                access to the EPFs as appropriate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those plans must also take account of any
                re-prioritisation of resources within the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development. As Mr Leslie warned, we must
                ensure that in this or any other area we do not implement any
                new structures, policies or processes until we are sure that
                they will deliver the desired outcomes. That, again, echoes a
                point that the Committee for Finance and Personnel made in its
                report on the Executive programme funds.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In that report the Committee suggested that
                the Executive were, in some ways, making funding allocations on
                spec because they wanted to pursue proposals in a particular
                area but did not have specific measures. The Committee suggested
                that allocations should not precede the firmer proposals with
                all the relevant appraisals. That would be a pertinent area of
                interest for the Committee for Public Accounts, which regularly
                questions Departments as to whether allocations have preceded
                firm plans. We are trying to ensure that we follow through on
                some of the points raised by the various Committees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of Members, of whom James Leslie was
                the first, asked if there was greater scope for the Health
                Service to depart from policies that are determined in
                Westminster. I agree that we should try to determine and deliver
                policies that meet the needs of citizens in our region. We
                should not slavishly follow what is done elsewhere. There are
                already some good examples of that. There has been an integrated
                health and social services system for a number of years, but
                that is not to say that there are not gaps within that, nor that
                it meshes as well as the theory suggests.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of that, the health action zones,
                for instance, include social services. They are more
                comprehensive and are probably better developed than those in
                other areas. Our response to the new arrangements for primary
                care involves local health and social care groups that can turn
                out to be more sophisticated and more comprehensive than
                elsewhere. However, I readily acknowledge the point that all
                Members will make that the resources must be there to match the
                structural proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley, George Savage and Gerry McHugh
                raised points about retirement schemes for farmers. Early
                retirement and new entrants schemes are discretionary measures
                that are provided by the EU rural development regulation. Such
                schemes, as Members will appreciate, are expensive to run.
                Nevertheless, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development
                commissioned a study of their value and effectiveness. The study
                was not conclusive, largely reflecting a lack of research in
                that area. On foot of that, the Minister commissioned further
                research from Queen’s University in conjunction with
                University College Dublin into the economic, social and
                environmental aspects of such schemes. The results of that
                research will be available in the summer of 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">George Savage then drew attention to
                modulation and match-funding as a source of money for early
                retirement schemes for farmers. Again, the Minister of
                Agriculture and Rural Development is considering that, but it is
                important to remember that any such scheme will be expensive. It
                should also be remembered that modulation money, for our
                purposes in the Assembly, is outside the departmental
                expenditure limit. There are constraints, not least because of
                EU policy on how modulation money and match-funding can be used.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Quite a number of Members mentioned the
                Barnett formula. The Executive are certainly committed to
                addressing all those issues with determination. We must do so,
                not least if we are to be serious about tackling the backlog of
                underinvestment in infrastructure and the funding difficulties
                in health, education, transport and other services that many
                Members raised, particularly the Chairpersons of the relevant
                Committees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We tell ourselves how bad the Barnett formula
                is, and how badly underfunded it leaves us, but we cannot ignore
                the fact that spending per person here is much higher than it is
                in England. The Treasury will point to particular areas where
                our spending is markedly higher and will argue that we must
                reprioritise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The political reality is that the perceived
                wisdom across the water is that the Barnett formula is highly
                favourable to us. Many people there would argue that we should
                receive a lower share of public spending or that the tapering
                effect that the Barnett formula has on our future spending plans
                is exactly the way things should be going.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must remember that others do not see the
                problem as we see it. In all political exercises we must bear in
                mind that not everyone will automatically move over to see
                things from our perspective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards services for which we are
                responsible and which are covered by our departmental
                expenditure limit (DEL), we were able to spend 25%-30% more per
                capita than in England in 2000-01. People elsewhere will not
                miss that point. No matter how often we make the points about
                need and coming out of conflict we must remember that in some
                areas of the debate on the Barnett formula we will have an
                uphill argument.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The EU peace programme is extra to our
                allocation. Again, in a sense, it is easy for the Treasury to
                argue that that is a generous concession in relation to public
                spending and reflects the fact that we are coming out of
                conflict. To that extent they count it as part of their
                contribution to the peace dividend. The Treasury will also point
                out, in relation to the debate on the Barnett formula, that the
                Chancellor’s initiative offered us further facilities, such as
                asset sales, and that the Assembly chose not to use some of
                those. Let us be clear: the arguments will not be all one-way.
                The warning was well made by Mr Leslie.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Séamus Close promised that he was going to
                make a new point — not one on familiar territory — so I
                listened closely and carefully to what he said about
                prioritisation. Shock, horror — I agree with him. We must
                consider our priorities very carefully now and more fully in
                next year’s spending review. That is what the Programme for
                Government and Budget processes should be about. We have the
                right to choose to spend more in some areas than is spent in
                England. However, the corollary is that we would have to spend
                less in other areas — either less than is the case in England,
                or less than we have allocated in the past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close said that we should not slavishly
                follow what has gone before and suggested we were doing just
                that. He talked about money being locked up in Departments, and
                about Departments holding on to money. I have complained
                elsewhere that there is a danger in that for all of us. It is
                not just the Departments, the Civil Service, or at ministerial
                level, it is also at departmental Committee level. We have had
                some evidence of it in the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very easy for Departments, Ministers
                and departmental Committees to get locked into the &quot;Does my
                budget look big in this?&quot; syndrome. It then becomes a
                matter of comparing their increases with other people’s. It
                becomes a matter of saying that, because a budget line has
                existed, it must continue to exist and be increased. Therefore
                existing budget baselines are not scrutinised, and everyone
                competes for additional bids.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the point will come when the
                Assembly will see the same degree of interest in what
                Departments do with the moneys they already have in their
                baselines as there seems to be in what happens to new bids.
                There is a great interest in chasing bids, particular those that
                have not been met, whereas the most important financial
                decisions relate to the moneys in the baseline. Members have
                said that they want more scrutiny and openness in relation to
                Executive programme funds. The proportion of the total Budget
                represented by the Executive programme funds shows that
                Departments are making decisions on much bigger sums of money
                that are not the subject of a report or scrutiny in the House or
                by the Committees. Therefore, the broader processes show that
                there is more for us to think about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Séamus Close remarked that we were slavishly
                following what had gone before. He then attacked the Executive
                programme funds and said that we could do without them. The
                establishment of the Executive programme funds, following
                devolution, means that money does not automatically go to
                Departments by the traditional route. The funds allow for a more
                cross-cutting approach. Executive programme funds have been used
                for some major regional strategic initiatives such as the road
                improvements that Alban Maginness referred to and the gas
                pipeline decisions that other Members referred to. We can make
                those longer-term commitments because of the Executive programme
                funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members spoke of the amount of money that is
                tied up in the Executive programme funds. They must remember
                that that money applies to next year and to the year after; it
                is not available for one year’s Budget, as some Members seem
                to think.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dara O’Hagan and others raised a point
                about the regional rate and tax-varying powers. We have covered
                a lot of that ground before. The projected increases suggest
                that the regional rate will rise by about £332 million in the
                2002-03 financial year. Obviously, that contributes to all of
                the spending that we try to undertake. I have no problem if
                Members want to identify priority areas that that money could go
                to. I recognise that there is a lot of unhappiness about, and
                criticism of, the rating system — not only about how the
                rating policy operates, but how we deal with the issues in the
                budgetary process. I recognise — indeed I would be a fool to
                not recognise — that it is not a popular area of the financial
                process, but it is necessary. We need to contribute to public
                spending.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a Minister of Finance who wants money to
                be spent on public services and who is in favour of public
                expenditure, I defend the rate mechanism facility as a way of
                supplementing what we agreed would otherwise be inadequate
                resources. If the Barnett formula does not give us what people
                say that we need and deserve, and as Members are rightly
                stressing the plight of many services, we must find additional
                money from elsewhere. There is no point in fighting the end, if
                we do not will the means. The Executive can spend only what they
                have. They cannot make money appear from nowhere. Any reduction
                in rates, or capping of rates increases to inflation, will not
                give us the money that we need and will weaken our case for
                additional money from the Treasury.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Joan Carson, Joe Byrne and Gerry McHugh
                expressed concern about the position of district councils
                following the decision to reallocate £2 million from the
                resources element of the general Exchequer grant. I am happy for
                the Assembly, and the relevant Committees, to consider further
                whether that is the best way ahead. However, as Joan Carson
                pointed out, the draft Budget provides an 8·1 % increase in
                planned spending power for the Department of the Environment.
                That equates to a real increase of 5%. That was planned last
                year to ensure further progress in the compliance with EU
                environmental Directives. The costs of planned actions have
                proved tighter than anticipated, and that is not the only area
                where that has happened.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive concluded that with demands on
                other services, such as health, education and roads, it was not
                possible for us to improve on the substantial, real increase
                provided for the Department of the Environment for 2002-03. That
                was one of those instances where it counts as to whether health
                is given priority. There is a choice, therefore, in relation to
                reducing support for councils, moving more slowly on
                environmental issues or imposing restrictions on historic
                building grants. I noticed that some Members questioned whether
                environment and heritage services needed money. That is an
                example of a situation where hard decisions must be made. The
                sentiments expressed in the Chamber show that there are
                competing priorities.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sue Ramsey, Kieran McCarthy and Joe Hendron
                were among the Members who raised the question about the
                deferral of free nursing care for the elderly in nursing homes.
                In May 2001, the Executive agreed in principle to introduce such
                care from April 2002. However, as many Members have pointed out,
                the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                faces a range of pressures, and it is unable to meet all the
                demands that are already placed upon it. In that context,
                compared to the indicative figures that were published last
                December with the revised Budget, some £30 million was added to
                the allocation for health for 2002-03. That amounted to an
                increase of 8·1% over 2001-02. In the Budget statement, I made
                the point that that was not a full extra 8·1% because there is
                a technical switch from the Department for Social Development,
                which accounts for part of that figure. Members, and the
                Department, have pointed that out, but they are not pointing out
                anything that I had not already been upfront in saying in my
                original statement to the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such are the pressures on health and personal
                social services that there are not sufficient funds available to
                provide free nursing care without making cutbacks in existing
                services. The money that was allocated to the health and
                personal social services baseline for free nursing care is still
                there, but it is needed to meet other pressures as well. That
                decision was not taken lightly, and we recognised the fact with
                great reluctance. However, it would be dishonest not to
                represent the situation clearly to the Assembly. That deferral
                releases about £9 million to help maintain existing services
                elsewhere. It was not a decision not to give additional money
                — it was a decision whereby additional money, originally given
                for free nursing care, will go to meet other pressures in health
                and social services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Esmond Birnie emphasised the importance of
                research as a key investment for future prosperity. The
                Executive recognise that university research is an important
                investment. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment
                and the Department for Employment and Learning are jointly
                leading the preparation of a regional innovation strategy, and
                it should be available early next year. Higher education funding
                has been increased by 5%, and that includes provision for the
                support programme for university research (SPUR), which will
                receive £40 million, funded on a pound-for- pound basis with
                the private sector, over the next five years. A further £7
                million investment for science research was announced in
                February 2001.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Éamonn ONeill, on behalf of the Committee
                for Culture, Arts and Leisure, raised several points about
                areas, such as the arts, museums and libraries budget, that the
                Committee felt were not getting the increases in funding that
                were needed. Those areas fared relatively well in 2001-02 in
                comparison with the previous year. Between them, they received
                an increase of £3·4 million. That significant increase has
                been carried forward into 2002-03. As in other areas, that does
                not take account of possible assistance from Executive programme
                funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that development plans for the
                Grand Opera House, together with other capital development
                proposals, are being considered by the Department of Culture,
                Arts and Leisure, in association with other interested parties,
                in an attempt to establish priorities for Belfast in the context
                of the bid to be European city of culture 2008. We have already
                identified the best way to deal with such issues as they mature,
                in discussions with the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.
                Members often ask us not to make allocations until we have full
                business plans and appraisals; on other occasions, we are
                exhorted to make allocations before we receive those plans. We
                cannot do both.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Ms Ramsey and Ms McWilliams
                about the health issues that they raised. They gave graphic
                descriptions of the pressure on the Health Service, which puts
                many of the smaller issues into perspective. Perhaps the
                Executive and Members who spoke on behalf of other Committees
                about other issues might reflect on that. However, we cannot
                simply say that money that might go elsewhere should be spent on
                health. As Ms McWilliams said, there is scope to examine the
                budget of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety to see whether it is managed and organised in the best
                way. We should consider not only the issues relating to the
                overall structures of the Health Service that were raised by Dr
                Hendron and Mr Maginness, but the methods and means that are
                used.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad to hear that Members and Committees
                are considering how we might achieve efficiency savings that
                would allow us to use the money in other areas. I welcome any
                advice on that. For example, the case was made that appropriate
                practices in community care would relieve some of the pressure
                on the acute services sector. The Department of Finance and
                Personnel and the Executive would not be averse to such an
                exercise. However, we must ensure that we work on the basis of
                evidence. We need a database, and work has already been done on
                a needs and effectiveness evaluation of health and personal
                social services. We must continue such work if we are to get
                stuck into the Barnett formula issue in the way that people want
                us to. It would also be useful for our own purposes, allowing us
                to see whether we are responding successfully to demands.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The budget for the Department of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety is not the only one that
                contributes to health provision. The public health strategy and
                other cross-cutting measures have shown that other Departments
                make a contribution. Perhaps, when Members suggest that we
                should simply tax the budgets of all other Departments at a flat
                rate of £10 million, we should remember that other Departments’
                spending programmes contribute to health outcomes. For example,
                spending on road safety by the Department of the Environment
                contributes to health outcomes, as will spending on structural
                maintenance or improvements to roads by the Department for
                Regional Development if it helps to reduce accidents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Work is going on in other Departments that
                has a bearing on health and safety issues too. We need to
                recognise that a cross-cutting device such as the Executive
                programme funds does not just help health in those services
                managed by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety; it has a bearing on our health achievements as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams, as well as Mr Cobain on behalf
                of the Committee for Social Development, referred to the
                increases in departmental running costs for the Department for
                Social Development. The Social Security Agency is obviously
                playing a leading role in the welfare reforms and modernisation
                programme, which includes working alongside other Departments to
                deliver more modern, integrated, efficient and customer-focused
                services in the area of social welfare needs. Clearly that
                requires an investment in departmental running costs, which is
                really what we are looking at when people talk about this. This
                programme is expected to deliver significant benefits and
                administrative cost savings. A ring-fenced budget of £130
                million over five years has been agreed with the Treasury to
                ensure that the programme is delivered, which accounts for the
                increase that has caught the eye of so many.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members, in the course of making
                observations on other issues, pointed to the global downturn and
                the impact it is having on our economy, and Mrs Courtney focused
                on this in particular. Obviously the downturn is something that
                has had an impact already, and it is likely to have a further
                impact no matter how resilient we hope our regional economy can
                be. We have already seen some job losses, but it will affect us
                in the longer term in two main ways. We are obviously a
                significant beneficiary of direct foreign investment. Therefore,
                in so far as the downturn inhibits and reduces that which will
                affect us, our export sales are also clearly going to be harmed
                too. A lot of this is going to be dependent on the fortunes of
                the US economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members such as Mr Byrne have emphasised
                their concerns about linking this to the possible or slight
                reduction next year in the budget for the Department of
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment. However, in all of this we
                must underscore a commitment we previously made that the
                Executive will be sensitive to the need to take any
                opportunities to support investment, especially in the difficult
                context that we have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also have to look at how effective we can
                be using all our policies. We need to remember that some of the
                issues that could arise as a result of the global downturn are
                not ones that call on the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment’s budget and the sort of programmes it runs alone.
                Indeed, the Department for Employment and Learning could very
                well find some of its programmes and services being called on to
                deal with some of the effects and exigencies of a downturn if
                the worst fears being expressed by some Members are realised. It
                is not just the spending on direct support to industry that
                matters. In trying to make longer-term investments in our
                competitiveness and seeing beyond the recessionary cycle that we
                all fear we are looking at now, it is clearly important that we
                sustain investment in infrastructure as well so that we will be
                in a better position to pick things up in the future.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In dealing with the wider economic context,
                people should remember that the Department of Enterprise, Trade
                and Investment is not the only Department that is, in many ways,
                contributing to the economy. Other Departments do so as well.
                That is one of the reasons the Executive are investing in
                infrastructure and transport. By making such an investment we
                recognise that, although it is hard for us to find the money in
                the Budget that we want to spend on infrastructure, roads and
                transport systems, we know that we cannot spend the amounts of
                money needed equally across the region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are projects that attract particular
                priority, and we cannot even out, in a perfectly arithmetic way,
                the priority that we attach to every road or connection. I take
                the point that was made by Gerry McHugh, Joe Byrne and others
                that many areas feel they are still missing out on investment.
                However, if we are going to invest seriously in some major
                roads, we should marshal the resources for them wherever
                possible and then concentrate on trying to find the resources
                for the other roads. Spending many small amounts on all roads is
                a less strategic investment and is exactly the sort of thing
                that we are trying to get away from, because underinvestment
                will not advance the equality agenda. We need to develop good
                targeted investment and spread it over time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alban Maginness referred to Water Service
                funding. In the Budget for this year there was an extra £14·5
                million to deal with the most pressing needs. That is retained
                in the draft Budget for next year, with a small increase of
                1·5%, so Water Service spending is just short of £221 million.
                We have to provide that money out of the Budget with absolutely
                no provision for it in our old friend the Barnett formula,
                because water and sewerage is not part of public expenditure
                across the water. We get no money for it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be serious health problems and
                added pressures if we do not make provision. That area of
                expenditure clearly has a health-related outcome, as we saw with
                cryptosporidium, but we do not receive any money from Barnett.
                People need to set that against some of the concerns that are
                raised about rates. If we get less in Barnett than we need for
                the services for which Barnett allocates money, and we have to
                fund other services that Barnett does not provide for, we have
                to be realistic about the sort of money that we want to add to
                what Barnett gives us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alban Maginness also raised the matter of
                train replacement. This is a follow-through from significant
                allocations made in the last Budget, and I welcome the fact that
                procurement has proceeded. Leasing of trains was commended by
                many and was considered, but outright purchase represented
                better value for money. It is not that leasing was not looked
                at.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Edwin Poots raised several points on behalf
                of the Committee of the Centre. First of all, the draft Budget
                does provide additional resources in various areas for the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. A
                bid for funding will be made next year for the review of public
                administration, and that is clearly understood by the Executive.
                I have no hesitation in sharing that with the Assembly. We
                clearly understand that there will be a bid for that next year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A children’s commissioner is another area
                that is the subject of consultation, not least in the context of
                the wider children’s strategy. The intention is clearly to
                appoint a commissioner for children in spring 2002, thus making
                progress there. Some Members, Monica McWilliams in particular,
                were worried that the fact that there is no discernible
                provision for it here in the draft Budget could mean that that
                appointment was somehow going to be hostage to financial issues
                and could be deferred on that basis. I want to give an assurance
                that that will not be the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Edwin Poots also raised the matter of funding
                for victims. He identified the fact that a further bid of
                £750,000 is being considered in relation to the social
                inclusion Executive programme fund. It would be wrong for me to
                speculate or give any advance indication on what is likely to
                happen there. The Executive published a consultation document on
                a victims’ strategy in August. We have contributed almost
                £1·7 million to the Peace II victims’ measure. That will
                address needs in a variety of ways, and £500,000 from the
                social inclusion Executive programme fund will be available to
                the victims’ unit this year and in each of the next two years.
                I hope that Members do not labour, as some people do, under the
                false impression that the Executive have done nothing in this
                area. Because they are aware of a new bid, they assume that no
                existing moneys have already been given.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fred Cobain raised issues relating to the
                north Belfast housing strategy. There is a funding package of
                £5·5 million available to Ministers for the purchase of sites
                for the first phase of the Housing Executive’s strategy to
                tackle serious housing problems. This total strategy has been
                costed at £133 million over a seven-year period. That is the
                type of exercise that we are looking at. Nobody is under any
                illusions that that strategy or the types of resources that it
                is going to require are going to be made good in just one
                Budget. Also, the URBAN II funding is being specifically
                directed to North Belfast. That is worth a total of £8·7
                million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were a couple of points that were
                partly particular but raised some more general questions. Joe
                Hendron suggested, on behalf of the Committee for Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety, that the benefits from extra money
                for the Health Service in England were not coming through to
                health here, but were somehow being diverted elsewhere. The
                Executive have allocated more money to the Health Service than
                we received as a Barnett consequential of the increases in
                England. That is not to say that we have been able to match the
                sort of increases that there have been in England, but if people
                look at the exact amount that we got for health through Barnett,
                they will find that that and more has gone into the Health
                Service. We have not taken anything from the Barnett
                consequential that we get for health; we have been able to add
                to it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To have made that sort of addition in health,
                as we did previously in education, in circumstances in which we
                were also having to carve out of the Barnett allocation money
                for water and sewerage and such like, shows that we are trying
                to prioritise. It also demonstrates that the Executive are
                trying to alleviate the difficult pressures facing the Health
                Service and, in particular, the very acute needs that the
                Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is trying,
                with her officials and services, to meet.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That effort has not yet provided the
                resources needed by the health and social services sector. I
                recognised this in the original Budget statement, and I have not
                gone into denial on the issue since then. We need to face
                several major issues relating not only to the draft Budget, but,
                more importantly, to next year’s spending review. I hope that
                Members and Committees will be understanding of the Executive’s
                decisions. We have already detected that Members are making a
                big deal of a slight decrease in one Department’s budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will not be able to take the spending
                review seriously if we lock ourselves into a position where
                there can be no decrease, where the spending patterns that we
                have inherited cannot be reviewed, or where we cannot review
                whether current expenditure is achieving the intended results.
                For example, if we can recognise that the intended results have
                been achieved, then we can afford to lessen priority in those
                areas and focus expenditure elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, Joe Byrne expressed a general
                concern about double accounting and the projection of £48
                million into next year’s Budget from moneys released this
                year. There is no question of double accounting; we have been
                upfront on the matter and have stated clearly that, based on our
                statement in the Executive’s position report, we have been
                able to achieve slightly broader scope for manoeuvre. That has
                been done by calculating the level of moneys in this year’s
                remaining monitoring rounds which could be carried over into
                next year’s Budget. It is not a question of double accounting;
                we have received moneys in the past through monitoring rounds.
                However, the level of moneys available in monitoring rounds of
                recent years will not necessarily continue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will recall that we have already
                retained some moneys from the June monitoring round, and, given
                our knowledge of the patterns that exist, we felt that we could
                project a level of some £48 million. That figure is based
                partly on a £13 million projected underspend by the Department
                of Enterprise, Trade and Investment this year. We have also been
                using the Executive programme funds as an additional guarantee.
                When people tell us to wipe out the Executive programme funds
                they must remember that that funding is taken into consideration
                when projecting that £48 million. That figure provides more
                room to manoeuvre than was available before. I hope that there
                is no question of double accounting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will respond in writing, or during a
                further consideration of the Budget, to other Members’
                questions. I appreciate Members’ comments. I look forward to
                seeing the Committee for Finance and Personnel’s digest of
                their points and its cogent advice on where the real priorities
                should lie, where we should be drawing lines through issues, and
                where we should be trying to move forward. As an Assembly we are
                becoming much more thoughtful and strategic in our approach to
                certain budgetary issues.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.30 pm</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Members for their contributions
                to what has proved a very useful debate. I thank the Minister
                for his comments, and I thank those Members who have endured
                until the death. My recollection is that the Minister
                entertained us for an hour and seven minutes last year. It would
                be welcome if he could stick to a 7% reduction each year, but I
                thank him for the thorough way in which he has dealt with all
                the points. It does have the advantage that Members will get
                less from me, because they have had more from him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Finance and Personnel will
                publish a report in mid-November. That report will emphasise the
                points made by the Committees in their written submissions and
                matters that have arisen today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to comment on the conceptual
                issues that a number of points highlighted, rather than on
                specific finance matters. Some Members who made exceedingly
                pointed remarks to me as Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                Finance and Personnel assumed that that Committee allocates the
                money. That is not the case. If you regard the Minister and the
                Executive Committee as Butch Cassidy and the Hole in the Wall
                Gang, we in the Committee are organising the posse. We can try
                to influence events, but we do not have carriage of the outcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister referred to comments made about
                the Barnett formula, which I remarked on earlier. When people
                ask for a review of Barnett, that is usually a coded request for
                more money. It is always nice to have more money, but in
                debating and allocating the Budget, we can focus only on what we
                have. It is not particularly useful to go on and on about the
                need for more money. We would always be able to spend more money
                if we had it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we do want more money, there are only
                three ways to get it: we can raise the rates, about which we
                have had plenty of debates; we can increase taxes, which we have
                also debated from time to time; or we can apply the principle of
                &quot;user pays&quot;. Mr Maginness did not mention that
                principle in his remarks about transport and infrastructure, but
                we shall have to look at it in a serious way if we want to
                increase our overall level of spending.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sadly, Mr McHugh has left us. Therefore, I
                will make the point to Sinn Féin. Its Members always invite us
                to copy the wonderful example of what happened south of the
                border. They should address themselves to what happened south of
                the border in the late ’70s and early ’80s when tax levels
                were increased to penal levels and a huge number of high earners
                fled the country. I was working in Dublin in the early ’80s
                and observed that. It became more apparent as the ’80s
                progressed. One of the key planks in the Republic of Ireland’s
                economic growth in the past decade has been a reversal of those
                penal taxation rates. There is an obvious lesson to be learnt
                there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close raised a conceptual issue with an
                overall resonance about sticking to the inherited formula. Mr
                ONeill made the point that the Department of Culture, Arts and
                Leisure was landed with a commitment from the Department of
                Education to provide an extra £10 million for a library review.
                I am not sure if that means that Mr ONeill thinks that they
                should not do that. It is however, an example of that principle.
                Mr McHugh was the only person to make the point that the focus
                should be on outcomes rather than on inputs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That points in the same direction as the
                remarks made by Mr Close. I relate that to what Mr Kennedy said
                about education. The general thrust of the debate was that the
                key priority of the Executive is health. Mr Kennedy proposed
                that education was the number one priority and that economic
                benefits can evolve from education that may enable us to address
                other problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The two areas have something in common. If
                children are taught to grow up healthier, the Health Service
                will not, in due course, have to meet the same bills as it does
                now. I appreciate that we have to pay for the consequences of
                what has gone before and that it will take some years to get
                that out of the system — to work the ill health out of people’s
                systems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If education were to be made the priority,
                the priorities within education would be for children to learn
                how to be healthier and how to protect the environment by
                learning not to throw litter all over the place. Councils spend
                enormous amounts of money collecting that litter. Children
                should learn about recycling waste, sustainable energy and a
                number of other related matters which, taken together, would
                make a considerable financial saving to the public service in
                Northern Ireland. One only needs to look at the situation in New
                Zealand — an example I often quote in the Chamber — to see
                how much better things can be done. However, the process has to
                be started at the beginning of the education cycle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Planning Service — another favourite
                example of mine — is constantly sucking in resources. It has
                received a considerable increase in resources over the last two
                or three years and is still looking for more. If the planning
                rules relating to rural development were tightened to the
                English levels, for instance, and if those relating to urban and
                industrial development were eased, the planning process would be
                considerably simplified. That would make it cheaper to
                administer, and you would get the stimuli in the right places. I
                say that with some hesitation with my good friend Mr Savage
                sitting beside me. However, I also live in a rural area, and if
                the people who live in those areas bore the true costs of living
                there, most of them would not. That is something Members can
                conjure with for a while.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has undertaken to take full
                account of the Committee for Finance and Personnel’s report.
                It is the Committee’s duty to ensure that he does. When the
                final Budget comes forward in December following consideration
                of all these matters, I trust that it will reflect the issues
                that have been raised in the Committee’s written submissions
                and in today’s debate. I look forward to debating the matters
                in further detail at that time.</p>
