    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="1"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Medical Negligence Cases</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes in which to propose the motion  and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who are  called to speak will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses its deep concern at the delay in  resolving some medical negligence cases, with one case ongoing for 27 years,  and a total of 55 cases lasting over 15 years; and calls on the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety to commission a review of all medical  negligence cases outstanding for 10 years or more, to ensure that they are  being dealt with expeditiously, and to report on how cases, generally, can be  handled in a more efficient, timely and compassionate manner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. My colleagues and  I tabled today&rsquo;s motion in response to a number of issues. First, when we deal  with our constituents, a bigger picture often develops. I have been dealing  with a family whose 18-year-old son was severely handicapped as a result of a  medical procedure that took place 16 years ago. The family has reluctantly  fought a legal case throughout that time, not for financial reward but to  ensure that financial resources are available to their son so that he can be  looked after and cared for after they depart. That case is only one example of  the legal engagement that families have with the Health Service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that the vast majority of medical  procedures are carried out professionally and with due diligence and care.  There is no question that our Health Service operates normally in that field,  but given the numbers involved &mdash; hundreds of thousands of procedures take place  every year &mdash; we will run into negligence, lack of care and mistakes. Families  and individuals have the right to come back to the boards and challenge them on  their duty of care. The motion today is about how those challenges are being  dealt with.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A large number of cases have been evolving for more than 10  years. Even though that is a quite lengthy period, I use it for a reason. An  Audit Office report of 2002 suggested that no medical negligence case should  last more than six years. It stated that medical negligence cases lasted longer  in courts than any other negligence cases against public bodies. I use the  period of 10 years because of a number of factors. It can take time for a  medical injury to show its full extent and the effect that it will have on an  individual&rsquo;s life, especially when a child is involved. Also, such claims can  be very technical in nature, both medically and legally. As we all know, the  law can move very slowly. Any case that has lasted more than 10 years should be  reviewed from a legal perspective and a compassionate perspective as to whether  it should continue to be fought.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have to remember that we have placed an onus on the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the health boards  to treat and care for people and to protect public funds. We are not suggesting  that the Health Department, for any case over 10 years old, should put up its  hands and pay out compensation. The Department is open to fraudulent negligence  claims and claims from families and individuals who are clearly upset about how  their medical treatment worked out, even though there may be no actual legal  negligence. We are balanced in our approach to this issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have concerns about how the Health Department has managed  the process. This is not a new issue to arise before legislators. I have  referred already to the Audit Office report of July 2002, which examined  compensation payments for medical negligence. It will come as no surprise that  I, as a former Chairperson of the Public Accounts Committee, give great weight  to Audit Office reports because that body is tasked with and has a proven  record of thorough investigation and making relevant and helpful  recommendations to Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report of 2002 throws up a number of suggestions and  observations. In paragraph 8 on page 8, it states that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Department&rsquo;s guidance, issued in 1998, required  each Trust to set up and maintain a database with information on all claims for  litigation. The Department has advised us that it had taken steps to ensure  that both Boards and Trusts hold comprehensive information on all outstanding  claims.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Paragraph 9 of the report states that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Department should ensure that it has access to  basic information about claims for clinical negligence, so that it is able to  inform itself and disseminate, in summary form, this information throughout the  HPSS. The Department agrees with this recommendation and sees any future  changes in HPSS structures as facilitating wider partnership.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Given that recommendation in 2002, with which the  Health Department agreed, one would imagine that the Department would be able  to provide to public representatives a full disclosure of the facts and figures  around medical negligence cases. When I asked a question about those cases on 2  July 2010, I received a significant amount of information about the number of cases  and the length of delay in each. However, I only received financial information  for two years. I was told that, given the review of public administration in  the health boards, trusts and the Health Department, the information that was  provided previously by private legal services was unavailable. I find that  surprising given that, in 2002, the Health Department put in place measures to  collate that information.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was provided with an information pack, as all Members are  for these debates, on outstanding medical negligence cases. It contains yet  another circular &mdash; Departments are very good at providing and issuing those to  their staff. There is no date on it, but, from reading through it, I believe  that it is from 2008. It contains guidance to claims handling in Health Service  care organisations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It sets out in detail what any health facility should do  once a medical negligence claim is made against it. It covers four crucial  areas. It states that each board should identify a member:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;with clear responsibility for clinical and social  care negligence issues &hellip; The organisation&rsquo;s claims handling procedures are in  compliance with all &hellip; Court Service Protocols &hellip; The organisation maintains a  database of comprehensive, up-to-date information on all claims to support  claims management&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">How can they have an up-to-date claims management  file if the Department of Health cannot tell me, as a public representative, in  reply to a question in the Assembly, what the facts and figures are for the  past 27 years? There must be a gap in the information somewhere or else I, as a  public representative in the Assembly, and the public are not being given full  information.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">More crucially, the document refers to what we also call  for in our motion:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;An annual review is carried out of all of the  organisation&rsquo;s clinical and social care negligence cases with a view to &hellip;  avoiding record duplication&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">&mdash; it appears that records are incomplete &mdash; and:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;considering closure of cases static for 3 or more  years &hellip; evaluating expected compensation, associated costs&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I am concerned that, although we have a circular  that was issued in 2008 and Audit Office recommendations that were accepted by  the Department in 2002 &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  The Member referred to an annual review, yet the motion asks only for &ldquo;a  review&rdquo;: is he calling for the Minister to do this each and every year or is  this a one-off, as the motion states?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  will clarify. Despite all the circulars and the Audit Office recommendations,  my view is that reviews are either not taking place or are not comprehensive  enough. I believe that the Department of Health, in the guise of the Minister,  must bring in the 55 cases that range over a long time &mdash; more than 10 years &mdash;  go through them one by one and set out an action plan around each. As we have  been told, any case lasting more than six years is seen to be extraordinarily  long. We have cases that have lasted up to 27 years, although I hear on the  grapevine that that case may have been settled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Health and the Health Minister have a  responsibility to start reining in such cases and not simply for cost reasons,  although there is a cost associated with all those cases. I could not get the  full costs, but over a two-year period they were in the region of &pound;2 million.  Compensation payouts over a five-year period amounted to &pound;60 million. A rough  sum is that legal costs usually amount to a third of the compensation, so  around &pound;20 million could have been paid out in legal fees in the past number of  years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Someone has to take responsibility. I am calling for a  review, governed by the Minister, of all existing cases and for them then to  carry out what they said they would in 2008: an annual review of each case.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  too am concerned at the time taken to settle medical negligence cases. The time  that it takes to conclude cases, particularly those highlighted in the press,  only prolongs the suffering of victims, their families and the medical staff involved.  I am also concerned about the cost, especially at this time of financial difficulty,  when we are about to see significant cuts made in the Budget by a Conservative  and Liberal Government across the spectrum.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Victims of clinical and medical negligence have a right to  seek compensation when something goes wrong. However, it is clear that medical  costs are spiralling out of control, and control must be retained and  maintained by the Health Service. Between 1991 and 2001, &pound;55 million was paid  out in compensation. Information that I obtained in response to a question for  written answer demonstrated that costs have continued to soar despite a report  by the Northern Ireland Audit Office in 2002. Legal costs and compensation for  the years 2007 and 2008 totalled &pound;11 million, roughly &pound;3 million of which was  legal costs alone. Costs for the years 2008 and 2009 soared to nearly &pound;20  million, a quarter of which was paid out in legal costs. Where does that stop?  Although those figures represent a small proportion of the overall budget, the  costs associated with claims are worrying, particularly when we will see cuts  imposed by Westminster.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Department&rsquo;s policy circular that was  published in March this year. It provides guidance for health and social care  organisations when handling claims. It appears to be comprehensive, but more  must be done. I am aware that health professionals work in a very stressful and  busy environment and that, like the rest of us, they are only human and are not  immune from making mistakes. However, in order to limit the number of medical  negligence claims, it is the Department&rsquo;s duty to ensure that all staff are  trained carefully in medical procedures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also important that the Department and the medical  professionals who work in the Health Service be protected from claims made  without foundation. Having looked into the subject, I found the legal process  to be lengthy and complex, and it is probably responsible for the time that it  takes for cases to be heard. It is said that, if a case goes to court, the time  from the beginning of the legal process until a case is heard can be 10 years.  Perhaps a new system needs to be set up to deal with medical negligence claims.  However, it is up to the Health Minister, in conjunction with the Minister of  Justice, to investigate that. We now have the powers to make changes for the  benefit of all, and we should use them if we need to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A Northern Ireland Audit Office report published in July  2002 highlighted the number of outstanding claims. Since March 1995, the number  has risen. It is imperative that the Department do everything that it can to  speed up the processing of those claims, for the benefit not only of those  involved in the legal process but of the taxpayer. The longer a case goes on,  the greater the legal costs. Indeed, I have raised the idea of addressing the  cost of medical negligence claims as a way to save money, but, so far, I have  been ignored. It is time to act, where possible, to reduce such incidents. No  one is immune from making mistakes; however, &pound;55 million over 10 years is a lot  of money, so we need to try to reduce that figure.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  The motion is expedient at this time, and I welcome the opportunity to discuss  it. Many of us will have been surprised to hear that several medical cases have  lasted long beyond what could be deemed to be a satisfactory period. However,  we must appreciate that there is no quick, perfect-fit solution that the  Minister can use to bring those cases to a conclusion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was also a little surprised when I read the motion, which  calls on the Minister to provide details:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;on how cases, generally, can be handled in a more  efficient, timely and compassionate manner.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I can only assume that the Department&rsquo;s most recent  guidance slipped the attention of the Members who tabled the motion. If the  Minister were to adopt such an approach, he might be the one acting negligently  and irresponsibly. The Department has a duty of care not only to the patients  with whom it deals from day to day but to its staff.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Sorry; no. I want to make progress.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Healthcare personnel often work in difficult circumstances  and with significant risks. Therefore, when something regrettably goes wrong,  we must ensure that there is not a knee-jerk reaction to hang people out to  dry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls on the Health Minister to:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;commission a review of all medical negligence cases  outstanding for 10 years or more&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I agree that it is regrettable that a number of  cases have lasted that long. However, the sheer complexity of many of those  legal actions may not be immediately obvious. By its nature, medical negligence  litigation is incredibly complex and multifaceted, and, compared with other  legal actions, inevitably it takes longer to reach a conclusion. We must also  appreciate that, in the wider scheme of things, those cases represent only 0&middot;6%  of the total operating costs of health and social care bodies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department obviously appreciates that there has been a  problem with the system for dealing with negligence cases, although the current  Health Minister has somewhat inherited the problem. However, since taking  office, he has introduced various new guidance notes and procedures for dealing  with such cases. Therefore, although the motion is undoubtedly pertinent, in  that headline-grabbing figures are involved, we must appreciate that the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is tackling, has been  tackling and will continue to tackle the long-running legacy issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I will preface my remarks by saying, as Danny Kennedy did, that there are  genuine cases involving people who have been injured as a result of an  experience while in the care of the Health Service. At the same time, we live  in a society in which there is a growing claims culture. Health Service  professionals are working under greater demand and increased pressure as a  result of the growing number of claims. We need to be aware that there is a  balance to be maintained in the background.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have heard the figures relating to the cost of claims.  That picture has been well illustrated. In the 2008-09 financial year, claims  against the Health Service resulted in settlements totalling &pound;14&middot;6 million, and  the legal costs of those claims amounted to around &pound;5 million. Given the  current financial difficulties that we face, that is a serious drain on the  Health Service, and the Minister must consider that issue carefully. That is  why I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The current trend, in which some medical cases have taken  10 years to settle &mdash; with a small number of others having taken much longer  than that &mdash; represents an unacceptable timescale. There are different ways in  which the Department can intervene, the first of which is through early  intervention. Preventative steps that can be taken to reduce claims against the  Health Service may involve a review of current practices. Where accidents  occur, measures must be in place to avoid any recurrence of such incidents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we know, the promotion of quality care and safety is  always a high priority for the great majority of the people who work in the  Health Service. However, incidents can occur that open the way for legitimate  claims of negligence. Where appropriate, lessons need to be learned from such  incidents, and patient safety must always be a top priority for every  individual employed at every level in the Health Service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth reminding ourselves of some of the Department&rsquo;s  claims-handling protocols in health and social care. For example, it aims to  improve the initial communication between the disputing parties by establishing  a timetable with recommendations for the exchange of relevant information and  by setting standards for the content of correspondence. Those protocols help to  reduce the time involved in the handling of medical negligence cases.  Compliance with the protocol timetable should also help the parties involved to  make an informed judgement on the merits or otherwise of the case at an earlier  stage. Compliance also provides an opportunity to improve communication between  the disputing parties. That, in some cases, can lead to an early settlement of  disputes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety to examine all other possible methods, such as alternative dispute  resolution, whereby cases are resolved through arbitration or mediation or, in  some cases, through determination by an expert, which can help to reduce delays  in those cases.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Health and care organisations should always manage claims  proactively, including, where appropriate, through early settlement  negotiations.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  That can lead to considerable savings that can be directed into front line  services.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I support the motion and hope that the Minister, whom I welcome to the Chamber,  can help to overcome the problems that we are discussing. I thank the Research  and Library Service for providing an excellent information pack. I assure  Members that I will not go through it all this morning, but it is useful and  welcome information that will help us to get our heads around what we are  discussing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Alliance Party health spokesperson, I express real  concern that we have to spend money on compensation for medical or clinical  negligence. I am sure that every effort is being made to eliminate it  altogether or as far as possible and to ensure that patients get only the best  from our Health Service. The motion outlines cases of negligence and, indeed,  the time that it takes to settle. As other Members said, it must be a very  harrowing time for the families involved. One case lasted some 27 years, and it  is unbelievable that people had to endure the trauma for all those years. Other  cases have lasted over 15 years. We all surely agree that that is unacceptable,  and I am sure that our Health Minister is also most unhappy with lengthy and  protracted cases.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Audit Office&rsquo;s 2002 report on compensation payments for  clinical negligence tells us that some &pound;55 million was paid out over 10 years. That  is a great deal of money that could probably have been better spent on  providing front line services. However, I hope that improvements have been made  since that report was published and, indeed, that measures have been put in  place to ensure that clinical negligence has been reduced and curtailed as much  as possible. On behalf of the Alliance Party, I support the motion and look  forward to real progress on this subject.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: We  should preface our remarks by realising that the seriousness of the situation  mandates us to look at the causes and at how people can receive a speedier,  more adequate and efficient response. However, secondly, we must realise that  compensation for medical negligence came to, I think, about 0&middot;61% of the Budget  in 2008-09. Therefore, we should deal with the problem in the right context,  because we have a world-class Health Service, and, in many cases, the doctors,  nurses and all the professionals who are allied to medicine work above and beyond  the call of duty and beyond their allotted working hours. Their career is not  about making money; it is a vocation. They deserve the full support of the  House as they go about their day-to-day activity. We have a world-class  National Health Service that is free at the point of use, and long may it  continue. However, it is appropriate to rectify any failings in any service  quickly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I must express a concern that, at times, much of Europe is  following America&rsquo;s example and developing a claim culture. I have sat on a  number of boards, not necessarily medical boards, where information has come  back that a legal claim has been made against us. The legal advice is that,  given that we cannot get the money back because it is from the Crown, it will  cost us more to fight the case than settle it. In a number of cases, I have  been extremely frustrated because, although I thought that the case was not  just, the legal advice was that the cost of fighting it would be greater than  the cost of settling it. Therefore, on some occasions, justice went by default.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is necessary to deal with that, because we do not  operate in a free environment regarding costs. We should consider where we are  today. Not my words but those of the Oxford report on economics stated that, two  years from now, the United Kingdom will face a debt of &pound;1&middot;2 trillion. That is a  comfortable figure, because none of us, nor the public, generally deal with  such figures, so we do not understand them. However, to break it down: in 2012,  every household in the United Kingdom will be in debt to the tune of &pound;47,000,  and, to break it down even further, in 2012, every person in the United Kingdom  will carry a debt of &pound;19,900. Those are the figures in the report from Oxford  Economics and the Economic Research Institute of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There will be a contraction in public spending, and that  debt will be have to be serviced before we can provide any money for any public  service. We cannot provide the money for health, education and everything else  and then pay the debt. We have to deal with the debt to ensure that we do not  get into a position similar to that of Greece, where the markets decide that  cheques are being written that can no longer be paid, resulting in some form of  spiral.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that there are lawyers in the Chamber. We need to  ensure that cases that are brought before us are not abused by lawyers to  generate income. Often in court cases, I have found that lawyers say that they  need an adjournment to consider a report or a little fact, and, all of a  sudden, the case spirals out through no fault of the Health Service but because  of lawyers. Recent experience shows that lawyers become millionaires and the  victims get a report. The important thing is that, in a case of medical  negligence, an appropriate human rights framework is put in place and that  there comes a speedy redress.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I preface my remarks by recognising  that the Health Service has an excellent workforce who do great work, often in  difficult circumstances. A number of issues have been highlighted in the  debate, including the need for appropriate compensation for victims of medical  negligence and the cost of medical negligence. We need to look at the time  taken to deal with cases and the reasons for delays, and, finally, the lessons  that need to be learned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When an individual finds themselves in a situation of  medical negligence, the Health Service needs to have adequate, appropriate and  responsive systems in place to deal with what will be a difficult situation for  all the parties involved. It has to be asked whether the current system is  providing that service, and a number of cases have been highlighted where that  does not appear to be the case. John O&rsquo;Dowd highlighted a situation in which a  family have been waiting for more than 16 years for compensation for their son,  who was left severely disabled when medical treatment went wrong. Such  compensation would enable that young man&rsquo;s family to support him in the best  possible manner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When we examine whether the system is responsive to the  needs of those who find themselves in such a position, it appears not to be in  some more complex cases. Consistent delays, cancelled court dates and the  unavailability of documents are all contributory factors to why cases take so  long. Any review would have to look into such detail.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When referring to the cost of medical negligence, we have  to examine not only the financial costs but the human costs associated with  something going wrong. When a patient of the Health Service has to take a  claim, they should be appropriately compensated, and no one would disagree with  that. However, the Health Service must also expedite a complex and legalistic  process; it needs to act quickly and not be the reason for delays. Some Members  referred to the costs that affect trusts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The information pack indicates that, collectively, trusts  spent 0&middot;61% of their entire operating budget on medical negligence cases in the  2008-09 financial year, a time of obvious budget constraints. That warrants a  serious review. If we are serious about learning lessons, the Minister needs to  address the analysis of the types of cases being brought in each trust;  hopefully, he will do that in his contribution to the debate. For example, how  many of the 184 claims in the Belfast trust related to ear, nose and throat,  maternity and so on? We need to see a breakdown of the specialities so that we  can see that lessons are learned and mistakes are not repeated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">John O&rsquo;Dowd referred to the Audit Office&rsquo;s 2002 report.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether all of its recommendations have been  implemented. Will he enlighten the House about where we are, eight years down  the line, as regards all the issues that were highlighted in 2002? One of the  worrying things that stood out to me when I read the briefing paper is that the  overall cost to trusts&rsquo; operating budgets was 0&middot;38% in the 2007-08 financial  year and 0&middot;61% in 2008-09. If the costs are going up, that does not point to  improvements in the service. The only way forward is a review of current  delayed cases and a report on how the Health Service can deal with them in a  more efficient, timely and compassionate manner. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I thank the Members for tabling the motion. Rather than seeing it as a  headline-grabbing issue, Members must appreciate the complexity of the issues  raised in some of the cases. One would wonder whether the proposers have looked  at what the Health Minister has done to deal with those cases in a more  efficient, timely and compassionate manner. If they looked at what the Minister  has done since taking office &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I recognise what the Minister has done. However, does the Member agree that,  despite what the Minister has done and the guidance that has been sent to  trusts, the operating cost to each trust has increased over the last couple of  years?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member will have an extra minute added to his time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for her intervention. I accept that, and I will  deal with that issue later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Since the Minister took office, he has been very proactive  on the issue, long before it was a headline-grabbing issue. It has received a  lot of coverage, particularly in recent weeks, but the Health Minister has set  up a programme of work over the last number of years to improve arrangements  for handling claims against health and social care organisations. In 2008, the  Department established a project group to look at the range of personnel in  each of the health and social care trusts and other applicable bodies. I am  sure that the Minister will provide details of that when he speaks later. The  Department&rsquo;s guidance notes on handling claims in health and social care  organisations were updated as recently as March. The updated guidance advises  health and social care organisations of the procedures that they should follow  in the management of all negligence and personal injury cases.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">These cases involve large and complex issues, and all the  Members who have spoken noted that they are not easy to deal with. Claims range  from the deserving to the malicious, which have to be weeded out and responded  to. Even Mr Bell acknowledged that this can be a costly way of dealing with  spurious claims. We have to find a system that deals with it better and more  quickly. That is exactly what the Minister has been working to do over the last  number of years: to get that fine line between the genuine cases and the  spurious cases brought against health and social care trusts. Dealing with each  of those is a matter for health and social care trusts directly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, one must look at the balance between dealing with  legitimate and spurious claims and dealing with them in a timely fashion. As  other Members have said, some claims have lasted for a number of years. That  cannot be good for anyone. It cannot be good for the health trust or the  patient pursuing the case, and it adds to an enormous legal bill. The issues  are very complex, and I urge Members to take note of that and to note that the  Department does not play an active role in the administration of cases or  litigation. Those are totally the responsibility of each of the health and  social care bodies.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  That is the very point of the motion: the Department does not play an active  role in the litigation. The Department must play an active role in resolving  outstanding cases and in ensuring that the boards carry out the reviews that  they are supposed to be carrying out. There is no evidence to suggest that  those reviews are being carried out robustly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I thank the Member for his point. The Department does not carry out a role in  the litigation: however, it has a role in reviewing how trusts are doing. I  suggest to Mr O&rsquo;Dowd that that is the difference. It is right and proper that  the trust, which the claimant is pursuing, should be involved in the  litigation. The Department oversees the length of time it takes to deal with  those cases. No quick fixes or blanket responses will resolve those cases. The  complexity and sensitivity surrounding them will ensure that they last longer  than the average compensation claim. There are issues that we must all be  mindful of when dealing with the issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I welcome the  opportunity to address some of the issues and challenges that we face in  dealing with medical negligence in health and social care; in particular, the  time taken to resolve claims as referred to in the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to start by putting this matter in context. Every  year, there are approximately 2&middot;5 million attendances at hospitals as inpatient  admissions, outpatient appointments or accident and emergency cases. Doctors,  nurses and other health and social care staff work together with great  professionalism, in challenging and complex circumstances, to ensure that the  right care is delivered at the right time, in the right way, and, most  importantly, safely for every one of those attendances. I am happy to say that  that is exactly what happens in the overwhelming majority of cases. However,  things can go wrong occasionally. Regrettably, a very small number of patients  can suffer harm that leads to claims of medical negligence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of the 2&middot;5 million annual attendances at our hospitals,  around 500 can result in a claim for medical negligence, which equates to one  in every 5,000 cases. Furthermore, of those 500 claims, just over a quarter are  successful, resulting in financial compensation being paid. Although the  incidence is very low, I assure Members that, as far as I am concerned, every  one of those medical cases is a case too many. We work hard to give staff the  support that they require, including through investment, to allow them to discharge  their jobs as they wish.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In such situations, it is only right that patients and  their families are given a full explanation of what has happened, what has gone  wrong, the likely consequences for themselves or their loved ones, an apology  where appropriate, and an opportunity to have their questions answered. If the  patient or family remains unsatisfied, they have the right to make a complaint  to their trust or practice and, ultimately, a claim of negligence against that  body. Where legal action is chosen, it is essential that that is expedited. I  want to be clear that those cases concern events that were traumatic for all  those involved; staff, as well as patients and their families. It is in no  one&rsquo;s interest to prolong cases unnecessarily.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone concerned seeks and needs a speedy resolution: the  patient claiming harm or loss; the doctor or nurse wishing to safeguard their  professional reputation; and the trust wishing to manage the financial costs  and learn lessons to prevent future mistakes.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the four years up to March 2010, 2,447 medical  negligence cases were opened. In the same period, 1,878 cases were closed, and  damages were paid out in 523 of those cases. Evidence indicates that around 75%  of cases are resolved within four years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All claims are thoroughly investigated, and advice is  provided by the health and social care service&rsquo;s own experienced medical  negligence lawyers. In addition, all cases are subject to annual review. Early  settlement is negotiated where that is an appropriate course of action, but,  equally, claims without merit are robustly defended.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Undoubtedly, some claims take longer than others, and, in  general, the lengthier cases often involve complex medical and legal issues  that require significant clinical and other specialist advice. Many of the  cases that have been outstanding for 10 or more years relate to birth injuries  and are particularly complex and contentious. Allegations made must be  thoroughly investigated and that involves the instruction of independent medical  experts. However, Northern Ireland has only a small pool of medical experts who  can be called on as independent expert witnesses, which often means that expert  medical witnesses must be brought in from elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A major cause of delay in the longest cases is often a  failure on the part of solicitors acting for plaintiffs to progress matters  after the initial letter of claim has been issued to the point where legal  proceedings are issued. Once formal litigation begins, matters fall under the  control of the courts, which have a duty to deal expeditiously with such cases.  The courts will not tolerate unreasonable delays by a health and social care  body or any other party to a claim. Tight deadlines are set by judges for the  management of medical negligence claims once proceedings are issued. In fact, a  pre-action protocol for clinical negligence cases was introduced by the  Northern Ireland Court Service in April 2009 with the aim of dealing with cases  in a more cost-effective, efficient and proactive manner. It seeks to improve  communication between the parties to a claim by establishing a timetable for  the exchange of relevant information and by setting standards for the exchange  of correspondence relating to the claim. Compliance with that timetable can assist  the parties to the claim in making an informed judgement on the merits of their  case as early in the proceedings as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department issued guidance to health and social care  bodies in March of this year to ensure that their procedures for handling  claims are in compliance with the Court Service protocol. That guidance  requires them to have effective procedures in place to minimise delays and to  provide annual assurance to my Department on the general management of claims.  Trusts are also required to carry out an annual review of all their  organisations&rsquo; live medical negligence cases and to specifically consider  whether cases in which there has been no activity for three or more years might  be closed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s motion seeks a review of cases lasting over 10  years, and I can tell Members that such a review was carried out and that it  was completed last week. As a result, 23 cases have been closed and a further  12 have been settled pending agreement and payments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Besides the obviously unsatisfactory nature of protracted  delays for those involved in individual cases, we must consider the financial  implications of such lengthy legal proceedings, particularly the amount of  money that is paid out in legal fees. The costs associated with medical negligence  cases, including the payment of legal fees, are all met from within the health  budget, so money that is spent on those cases is money that must be diverted  from direct patient care. Therefore, it is clearly in everyone&rsquo;s interest that  such expenditure is kept to an absolute minimum. That is why I decided in 2008  that legal services to health and social care organisations should be provided  in-house by the directorate of legal services. That decision has already  realised substantial annual savings in the cost of the provision of legal  services. Savings have also been realised by challenging third party legal  costs and capping fees for legal counsels acting for trusts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I should also make it clear that there is no direct  correlation between the length of time that a case has been open and the legal  fees that are incurred. On the contrary, and as I outlined earlier, in many of  the longest running cases, there has been little activity for many years, and  consequently, minimal legal costs have been incurred. My Department has taken a  number of steps to try to reduce the number of claims of medical negligence  that arise in the first place and thus drive down the costs. Those steps  include driving up the quality of services and ensuring a focus on patient  safety; developing a new system for reporting and learning from adverse  incidents, which will better enable analysis of reported adverse incidences  that have occurred; and facilitating health and social care bodies in taking  steps to learn from such events to ensure that they do not happen again. My  Department has also established links with various national best practice and  patient safety bodies to ensure that the health and social care service has  access to the most up-to-date best practice guidance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In summary, I emphasise that the incidence of medical  negligence claims is thankfully very low &mdash; it is about one in 5,000 cases &mdash; due  mainly to the diligence and professionalism of our health and social care  staff. However, I have always been determined that claims are dealt with  compassionately, efficiently and fairly. My Department issued guidance in March  this year to all health and social care bodies to ensure that they comply with  the Northern Ireland court protocol on the efficient handling of claims. All  claims are reviewed annually, with particular attention being paid to those of  more than three years&rsquo; duration. A review of all cases of more than 10 years  was started at the beginning of September and completed last week, with a  number of cases being closed and some settled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There have been a number of references to a 27-year-old  case, and Mr O&rsquo;Dowd referred to it. The director of legal services advised that  no proceedings have ever been issued and that that file has now been closed.  The case concerned an individual with a disability, meaning that action can be  taken at any time during their life. No payments have been made in the case  either in damages, legal fees or expert fees.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other case that I referred to was 16 years old.  Proceedings were not served by the family&rsquo;s solicitors until June 2006, which  was 12 years after the initial letter of claim. The case was listed for hearing  in June 2010. It was adjourned after the medical witness became seriously ill,  and it has been re-listed for January 2011. There is no issue in that as far as  the Department or the Health Service is concerned, and there is nothing to be  gained by delaying proceedings. I will not allow that. None of the trusts will  permit cases to be dragged on. If cases proceed, it may be that proceedings are  held up by the plaintiff&rsquo;s solicitor for whatever reason, and there could be a  number of reasons why that could be. However, I am satisfied that our  organisations are doing all in their powers to avoid any unnecessary delays in  progressing cases to a conclusion and that they are working to ensure that  appropriate compensation for individuals is paid in a fair and timely fashion.  Members will have heard me say often that quality plus safety equal efficiency  and outcome. That applies as much in this issue as it does throughout the  Health Service. We must have the quality to get the safety, and that routinely means  proper investment, which we are struggling for. That in turn makes us more  efficient, and it ensures the best outcome for patients.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Before I get into the bones of the  debate, I want to take the opportunity, like other Members, to thank Research  and Library Services for, once again, producing an excellent research document  on the issue. I also take the opportunity to thank the Minister for attending  today&rsquo;s debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted to be associated with the motion, because  this is a real issue for some families. A number of Members who spoke in the  debate said that it is not just a matter of statistics; it is about families.  It seems to me that every day we are being told that millions of pounds from  the public pot are, for whatever reason, being spent. This is at a time when we  are in greatest need, when we could be facing dangerous cuts from the British  Government next month, and when people are demanding change and are looking to  the Assembly for that change. Once again, it seems that it is easier to spend  public money than it is to spend one&rsquo;s own money. Whatever the outcome of the  debate, we need to highlight that when public money is spent, it must be spent  properly and wisely.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I take from the Minister&rsquo;s speech that he has accepted the  motion; he indicated that the review started this month. I hope to get an idea  of when that review will report. When moving the motion, John O&rsquo;Dowd gave the  background and the reasons why the debate has been brought to the Floor. For  years, some families have been fighting and campaigning for justice &mdash; on their  own, I might add.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">John and many other Members, quite rightly, paid tribute to  Health Service staff. The motion is not an attack on staff. It is not an attack  on medical personnel. It is not an attack on the good work that Health Service  staff do daily, sometimes with very little resources. However, the fact is that  there are problems in some cases. We need to highlight that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety&rsquo;s report, published in July 2003, highlighted the fact that although  there have been mistakes and there are ongoing claims, in the long term,  lessons need to be learned from those mistakes, which will make healthcare safer  and result in far fewer instances of serious harm to people while they are in  medical care. Therefore, lessons can be learned daily. However, I am not sure that  they are being learned. Some cases have lasted over 15 years; some for 27  years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Audit Office report recommended that there should be a  database. It should not be a database to focus on one particular trust or  another; it should be a database to focus on learning lessons from mistakes  that can happen in the health sector, hospitals or, indeed, any other  Department over which the Assembly has control. We must find out why those  mistakes have happened and ensure that they do not happen in future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fifty cases have lasted over 15 years. That is wrong. It  just does not make sense. Alex Easton, quite rightly, pointed out the fact that  a sizeable portion of the money that has been spent in some of those cases &mdash;  more than &pound;55 million over 10 years &mdash; has been spent on legal fees. During the  past number of months, the issue of legal fees has been raised in the media.  The Assembly is here to make a difference. Let us try to make that difference  and ensure that we spend public money properly and that we learn lessons from  failures that occur on any issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Danny Kennedy talked about guidance. Officials must have  found time to write that speech because Danny and John McCallister actually  said the same things.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Like your party members?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I write my own speeches, as you can see. Perhaps, you and John should have a  yarn before you come into the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that there is guidance. However, there are still  outstanding cases. Therefore, is the guidance working? I do not know: it does  not seem to be working. It was pointed out that the Minister introduced that  guidance. I am not here to attack the Minister; and I believe that he knows me  well enough to appreciate that. He highlighted the guidance in his speech. If  he believes that it is working, will he send an urgent report to the Committee  for Health, Social Services and Public Safety to give us an idea of why the  cases are outstanding. The more information that we get, the less likely it is  that we will attack the Minister on such issues. Let us work together. If the  issue is a legal one, give us the information and we will see whether we can  make the changes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am a wee bit confused about the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s  position on the matter, although it seems to be supporting the motion. I believe  that the motion will receive all-party support.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tommy Gallagher reminded us that the issue concerns  families and human beings. It would be remiss of me not to declare an interest.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I have a family member whose case has been  outstanding for a number of years, following the death of her child. Jonathan  Bell mentioned the claims culture; I do not think that he meant that in  general, but it is an issue. However, my family member has had to jump through  hoops when all she wants are answers. She does not want money. It is not about  money. She wants the answers; she wants to know why her child died. She wants  and needs that closure. When we are talking about cases, do not automatically  assume that it is about people getting money. It is not always about that, but I  take on board the Member&rsquo;s point about the claims culture.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Audit Office report states that the Health Service is  losing several hundred million pounds in fees. That can be resolved by a more  inclusive process, a discussion, an explanation and the showing of a caring  face. There are ways of dealing with that. For the record, in fairness to the  people who make claims, it is not always about the money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also take this opportunity to highlight the positive,  proactive good work that the Patient and Client Council &mdash; formerly, the health  and social care councils &mdash; has been carrying out. Without its support, families  could have been destroyed. We should highlight that good work by health  professionals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Michelle O&rsquo;Neill outlined some possible reasons why some  cases take so long. If the Minister agrees to my earlier proposal to send a  report to the Health Committee, perhaps he could provide some information to  show why it is taking so long and whether that is because of the trusts or  because of legal issues. The Minister stated, rightly, that every case is a  case too many. It is only right that families are given the full information on  what happened and what went wrong but, sometimes, that does not happen.  Sometimes, families do not even get to talk to the person who was directly  involved in the case, and the only option left for them is to go down the legal  route. Families want answers; they do not necessarily want money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank everybody who took part in the debate. For want of  a better word, I think that it was a mature debate. Everyone realises that we  need to get to the end of this matter and that mistakes take place in all  sectors of life. We need to give people the opportunity to take action that  ensures that they get answers, and we need to ensure that we are not wasting or  spending public money willy-nilly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said at the outset of the debate, the Assembly is here  to make a difference and bring about change. Let us ensure from today that the  cases that have been outstanding for 15, 20, 25 or 27 years are no longer  outstanding next week. Let us ensure that, when people have an issue, they can  get it resolved as quickly as possible because, again, we are not talking about  statistics; we are talking about mothers, fathers, sons and daughters. We are  talking about human beings. It could be any one of our family members, and the  sooner we get this matter resolved, the easier it will be for families to move  on and get closure so that they can start healing and moving forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses its deep concern at the delay in  resolving some medical negligence cases, with one case ongoing for 27 years,  and a total of 55 cases lasting over 15 years; and calls on the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety to commission a review of all medical  negligence cases outstanding for 10 years or more, to ensure that they are  being dealt with expeditiously, and to report on how cases, generally, can be  handled in a more efficient, timely and compassionate manner.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="2"></a>Questions for &nbsp;Urgent  Oral Answer</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Justice</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice of an urgent oral question to the Minister of Justice.  Given the subject matter, I have agreed that a representative from each party  will be given an opportunity to ask a supplementary question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Lord Morrow asked the Minister of Justice, in light of  his recent statement that indicated there were five clerical errors by the NI  Courts and Tribunals Service in relation to the McDermott case including one in  relation to the sexual offences prevention order which stated the duration was  for five years rather than for life, if he can assure the Assembly that there  are no further discrepancies or clerical errors by the Courts and Tribunals  Service that could place the public at immediate risk; and if he can further  assure the Assembly that every step possible is being taken to review urgently  all sexual offences prevention orders and to ensure that this situation does  not arise again.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice (Mr Ford)</strong>: First, I wish to take the opportunity in the Chamber to  restate the apology that I have already made elsewhere to the survivors in the  McDermott case. I deeply regret that the way in which that information came to  light has added to their distress.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will be aware, I have recently written to the  Justice Committee to advise it of the outcome of the urgent review that I  instructed the Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunals Service to undertake of  its administrative processes in the McDermott case and a review of all  supervision and treatment orders. That review identified that several errors  were made in the McDermott case and that an error was made in the STO of a  separate case. Details of those errors and the proposed remedial action are set  out in a report that has been made available to the Justice Committee and that  I have placed in the Assembly Library. The relevant court records are being  corrected, and amended orders will be issued as soon as possible following the  approval of the trial judge.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I emphasise, however, that, although it is clearly  unacceptable that they occurred, those errors did not place the public at any  immediate risk. The defendants in that case are subject to the requirements of  supervision and treatment orders and sexual offences prevention orders as  imposed by the courts, together with the notification requirements under the  Sexual Offences Act 2003. The terms of the orders were stated in the sentencing  judgment issued by the judge and were made available to the prosecution, the  defence and the trust&rsquo;s representatives. That was the order of the court, and  the errors in the administrative processes had no material impact on the legal  effect of the orders. It is accepted, however, that the orders issued by the  court office were wrong and may have led to inaccurate case records being held  by the relevant agencies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I underestimate neither the impact that such errors have on  public confidence nor the importance of other agencies being able to rely on  the accuracy of documentation produced by the Courts and Tribunals Service. I  have, therefore, instructed the NICTS to conduct an audit of all sexual  offences prevention orders imposed by the courts in Northern Ireland since  their introduction in May 2004. The results of that audit will be shared with  the Justice Committee as soon as they are available, by mid-October. I have  also instructed the Courts and Tribunals Service to initiate an urgent systems  review of the arrangements for preparing, checking and issuing court orders in  Northern Ireland. I expect an interim report by the end of this month. Its  recommendations will be implemented as a matter of priority thereafter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To provide further reassurance, the Lord Chief Justice has  agreed that, in complex or unusual cases, such as the McDermott case, court  orders will also be checked by the trial judge before issue. In addition, I  have instructed that monitoring measures be strengthened to ensure that the  remedial action that has been implemented is effective. As Members will be  aware, I have also requested that Dr Michael Maguire, the chief inspector of  criminal justice in Northern Ireland, conduct a detailed investigation.  Although his statutory remit does not permit him to examine the detail of the  McDermott case itself or, indeed, any individual case, he will undertake a  detailed examination of the way in which sexual offence cases are dealt with by  the justice system. I expect to have Dr Maguire&rsquo;s report by the end of October.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am determined that the lessons learned in that case will  lead to improvements in the administrative procedures in the courts in order to  ensure that all agencies in the justice system play their part in protecting  children and vulnerable adults.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Justice (Lord Morrow)</strong>: I thank the Minister for making  himself available today to deal with this very urgent matter. I welcome the  fact that Dr Maguire will carry out a detailed investigation of how cases  involving sexual offenders are managed by the justice system. Has the Minister  had any discussions with the Health Minister about the potential for an  investigation to be carried out jointly with the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety, given its close involvement in cases of that  nature? If so, what was the outcome of those discussions? If he has not, will  he undertake to do so at the earliest opportunity?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank Lord Morrow for his supplementary question and for  welcoming the chief inspector&rsquo;s involvement in ensuring that the investigations  are robust and thorough. The Member specifically asked me whether I have  discussed the issue with the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety. At a meeting, I discussed it generally with the Minister, but I did not  discuss the specific issue of a joint investigation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The specific position at the moment is that the chief inspector  of criminal justice is just that: he has a remit for the justice system. The  issue that may develop from the meeting of the two Committees later this week  is whether there is scope for any wider investigation involving some of the  regulatory bodies operating in concert. That will need to be kept under review.  My concern was to ensure that the criminal justice system review got under way  as fast as possible to deal with the administrative errors that I have  highlighted.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs O&rsquo;Neill: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  The Minister referred to the distress of the victims in the McDermott case,  which, I think all Members would agree, was heightened by the fact that a blame  game was going on between the Department of Justice and the Department of Health.  Given that the Minister has now clarified the court&rsquo;s position in respect of  residency conditions, in answer to a question tabled by my colleague John  O&rsquo;Dowd, will he now give an undertaking to issue guidance for all agencies  involved in supervision and treatment orders or sexual offences prevention  orders that involve residency clauses, so that there is absolute clarity in all  relevant organisations as to their ability to influence, change or amend  residency conditions?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Justice: I thank Mrs O&rsquo;Neill for that  question. I must say that I do not accept that a blame game has been carrying  on. I have sought, at all times, to make clear the responsibilities of the  Department of Justice and its agencies and to be open and honest with the House,  with Members and with the public. That is not a blame game. That is seeking to  make the position absolutely clear: errors have been made, but those  administrative errors have not affected the handling of the case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs O&rsquo;Neill asked whether I would be issuing guidance to  all agencies. That is something that may need to be looked at on a  cross-departmental basis. I certainly do not claim any right to issue guidance  on the interpretation of the law to agencies that are the responsibility of  other Departments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  thank the Minister for the information that he has provided so far. Will he  confirm to the House whether victims are routinely kept informed in situations  such as this? Will he consider introducing a protocol to ensure that the needs  of victims are addressed, and will he ensure that that is included in the  review process that he mentioned earlier?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Mr Beggs raises a vital point. Yesterday morning, immediately  after informing the Chairperson of the Justice Committee of the discoveries  that had been made and formatted over the weekend, I ensured that the next two  people to be informed were the two victims who represent the six victims of  Donagh. I did that before I informed other Members of the House, other public  agencies or the media, which came last. I believe that that was entirely  appropriate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a wider issue relating to the fact that we have  recently published a guidebook for victims of crime and a specialist book for  victims of bereavement by murder or manslaughter. I am determined that, as a  whole, criminal justice agencies keep the needs of victims a priority in every  aspect of their work. I assure Mr Beggs that, where I have been involved, that  has been the case regarding the survivors of the abuse in Donagh.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Given the serious systemic and material errors that have come to light in the  past few weeks and that 37&middot;5% of supervision and treatment orders were found to  be erroneous and given the serious impact that that is having on public  confidence in our Court Service, will the Minister tell the House whether he  believes that the Court Service failed in its duty of safeguarding children and  whether he has confidence in senior management at the Court Service?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I know, without being flippant, that, when Mr McDevitt talks about  37&middot;5%, he is referring to three errors in eight supervision and treatment  orders altogether. However, we do need to get some sense of the overall  problem. The fact that I have instituted the review that I have and given  directions that all sexual offences orders put in place in Northern Ireland  since they were introduced six years ago are to be examined to ensure that they  are in order and the fact that I have invited in Dr Michael Maguire, chief  inspector of Criminal Justice Inspection, is, I hope, an indication to the  House and the wider community of how seriously I take the issue. I will look  with great interest at the report that Dr Maguire produces to see what  recommendations he makes as to how we address the problem in the future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms Lo: There is a great deal of confusion about the  case in the minds of the public and, indeed, MLAs. Will the Minister clarify  the distinction between the decision of the court &mdash; the so-called legal  loophole &mdash; and the administrative errors?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I am not sure whether I should thank my friend for that question  or not. There is indeed considerable confusion. Let me state the position  because, in many cases, it has not been accurately reported that there are  different strands. I apologise if I require longer than normal to answer questions  that deal with the issue.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Allow the Minister to continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Justice: The decision of the court was  quite clear. Judge McFarland made his direction on the disposal of the brother  who was convicted and the two brothers who were unfit to plead. The orders that  he made from the bench that day stood, regardless of what may happen. He made  his decision on the basis of expert witnesses and the evidence that was put  before him. That decision, as we know, led to the decision that, initially, two  of the McDermott brothers were returned to Donagh.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are two separate issues about what we have been  describing as a legal loophole. The court judgement is clear that, although two  of the brothers had sufficiently diminished mental capacity that they were not  fit to plead, they nonetheless did not have sufficiently diminished mental  capacity to fall within the ambit of a hospital order. That was seen as  something of a loophole. The second element that is being interpreted as a  legal loophole is the fact that, in Scotland, supervision and treatment orders  last for three years, whereas in Northern Ireland, as in England and Wales,  they last for only two years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first issue will be dealt with in the mental capacity  Bill, which the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety expects  to introduce next year with the support of the Department of Justice. I hope  that the second issue &mdash; the extension of supervision and treatment orders to  three years &mdash; can be dealt with by secondary procedure within this calendar  year in the House, subject to the approval of the Committee. Those are the  legal loopholes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The administrative errors that arose in the Courts and  Tribunals Service, which I put down in a statement that is in the <strong>Assembly Library and which was given to the  Committee for Justice yesterday, were simply that</strong>: administrative errors.  They had no material consideration in any way on the McDermott case.  Undoubtedly, the way in which they have been publicised has added to the  confusion and distress of the survivors of the McDermott family. I deeply  regret that, but they did not affect the outcome of the case.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="3"></a>Health, Social Services &nbsp;and Public Safety</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice of a question for urgent oral answer to the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety. For this question, I have agreed  that party representatives with a constituency interest will be given an  opportunity to ask a supplementary question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Wells asked the Minister of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety what plans the Western Health and Social Care Trust has in  place should the McDermott brothers discharge themselves from Lakeview Hospital  in the near future and attempt to return to Donagh, County Fermanagh; and  whether the Department has attempted to have the supervision and treatment  order amended to address this possible scenario.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: A supervision and  treatment order and a sexual offences prevention order are in place. They work  together to ensure the safety of children and the community and to ensure that  the McDermott brothers receive appropriate treatment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The sexual offences prevention order is the responsibility  of the police and ensures the safety of children and the public. The  supervision and treatment order was issued to the Western Health and Social  Care Trust by the court. The responsibility of the supervising officer in  accordance with that order is to approve or disapprove residency. Should the brothers  decide to leave Lakeview and return to Donagh or go elsewhere, the supervising  officer would discuss any change of circumstances with other relevant agencies  and approve or disapprove whatever address they present, according to the  evidence before the supervising officer at the time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On legal advice, the trust has not applied for any  variation to the supervision and treatment order, as the brothers are compliant  with the terms of that order. Should that change, the trust will take  appropriate action, in conjunction with the police and the responsibilities in  relation to the sexual offences prevention order.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have asked the Health and Social Care Board to undertake  a case review. I expect that that review will present its interim report to me  within a month and a full report shortly thereafter.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr Wells)</strong>:  I thank the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety for their willingness to come forward and answer questions for  urgent oral answer. That has been very helpful.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is quite clear that there is a distinct lack of clarity  about how we deal with sex offenders in this situation. The two Departments  need to get together and produce a document or guidelines so that the public  know exactly the relevant powers of each Department and understand exactly what  would happen in certain circumstances if someone is convicted of a sex offence,  is deemed unfit to stand trial or has served his or her sentence and been  released back into the public domain. Will the Minister give me an assurance  that that guidance will be issued so that everybody knows where they stand on  this incredibly complex, confusing and difficult situation?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I can assure the Member that I  will treat his request extremely seriously. I am not clear on locus standi,  but, like the Member and others in the House, I am very keen to see that type  of issue resolved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As far as the actual case is concerned, I understand the  confusions that have arisen. The legal loophole refers to the competence to  plead, which is something that I have said that I will address through my  mental capacity legislation. That legislation will be moving through the House  in due course, and we will look to address that issue jointly with the  Department of Justice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also looking for clarity and an explanation as we move  forward, not least because of the huge amount of comment and coverage of the  case in the press. Often, that coverage has taken things out of context and  been inaccurate. As I said, the sexual offences prevention order is something  that the police take the lead on. They can apply for residency orders within  that, but the order is designed to safeguard the community. Failure to comply  with its terms is a criminal offence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Social services take the lead on the supervision and  treatment orders, which last for two years and focus very much on treatment and  care of the individuals concerned, their care plans and how we take them  forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Does the Minister accept that, when the issue of where the brothers would  reside was under consideration in court, the supervising officer, who was an  employee of the Western Trust, unambiguously approved the brothers&rsquo; return to  Donagh? Will the Minister investigate how the issue was handled by the Western  Trust and whether the personnel who gave information to the court, in addition  to the supervising officer, were acting in accordance with stated criteria?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As I said, I have asked for a  case review on the matter. That will be investigated as we go along. The social  worker we are talking about was the case worker. She was an approved mental  health social worker and was approved to work in the learning disability team.  She was a qualified individual who was doing her absolute best. She was called  as a prosecution witness and, as one would expect, gave her evidence properly.  Social services did not make any recommendations about residency.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  The last point that the Minister made has added confusion to the issue. I have  a copy of a letter from the Lord Chief Justice, which he sent in an attempt to  give some explanation on the issue. He states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The position is that the Supervising Officer must  approve any address from the date of the making of the order&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If the letter is right &mdash; I believe that it is &mdash; and  the supervising officer was in court and heard the deliberations, why would he  or she not be totally aware of what was said in court that day? Was the  appropriate action taken on foot of the ruling in the court? It was stated in  the public arena that, had the contrary been done, that would have been a  contravention of the judge&rsquo;s decision. Was the judge&rsquo;s decision implemented,  and who are the experts in that field? I think that they are those in the  trust.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I listened to some of the  comments that Lord Morrow made, and I understand his confusion. As far as the  supervising officer is concerned, I will not have social workers hung out to  dry when they are trying to do their best and are doing it professionally and  properly, as they are asked to. Acting as prosecution witnesses in court, they  did not make any recommendations about residency. The order that returned the  two individuals to their family home was made by the court. The supervising  officer had no legal ability whatsoever to challenge the court&rsquo;s decision. Had  the individuals decided that they were not going to stay in the family home as  ordered by the court, the supervising officer would have had a role. However,  they have no role to challenge the judge in the judge&rsquo;s court. That is a matter  for the judge.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  In this highly unusual letter, which was written by the Lord Chief Justice to  the Justice Minister, the Lord Chief Justice says that direct evidence was  given by a doctor at the hearing about:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the [X] Road property, their home, their residence,  as their residence.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He says that, when asked whether he could envisage  another residence, the witness replied, &lsquo;No, your Honour&rdquo;. Given that that is  the case and that the trust gave that direct evidence, is the Minister  satisfied with the fact that the trust gave that evidence to the court and  that, therefore, what has happened ensued?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As I have said, I will hold a  case review and that will be able to clarify many of those points. As I  understand it, the doctor to whom Mrs Foster refers was not an employee of the  trust. He was there as an independent medical expert employed by the  prosecution, not as a member of the trust, and he was not there acting for or  speaking for the trust. The trust, the social worker and others were there  providing the same type of expertise. I hope that the case review will clarify  that. This is one of the points that I would like clarified. Because this  individual has &ldquo;Doctor&rdquo; in front of his name, it is assumed that he works for  the trust and, therefore, spoke on behalf of the trust, and everyone is  attacking the social worker and the trust. However, that is not the situation  as I understand it. That individual was an independent medical expert called by  the prosecution service. He was not an employee of the trust.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="4"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Human Trafficking</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: At the outset of this debate, I caution all  Members against referring to individual cases involving human trafficking that  are currently the subject of legal proceedings. The Business Committee has  agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for this debate. The proposer  will have 10 minutes to propose the motion and 10 minutes to make a winding-up  speech. One amendment has been selected and published on the Marshalled List.  The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes to propose it and five  minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to speak will  have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly condemns human trafficking; notes  with grave concern the growing prevalence of human trafficking for the sex  trade, domestic servitude and labour exploitation in Northern Ireland; further  notes that men, women and children are victims of human trafficking and that  human trafficking exists because of local demand; and calls on the Minister of  Justice and the Executive to raise awareness of human trafficking among the  public in order to assist the authorities in securing prosecutions against  those who carry out this modern form of slavery and to ensure that Northern  Ireland is a hostile place for traffickers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note that the Minister to whom the motion refers is not  in his place. That is a matter for him, but I hope that he will recognise the  Assembly and find his way in to hear the debate because I am sure that there  will be some points and questions to which Members would want to hear him  respond. Having said that, I am glad to see that he has arrived and is taking  his seat.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s intention in tabling the motion  was to raise awareness of the serious issue of human trafficking. We intend to  work with our colleagues in the House to ensure that human trafficking is a  priority for the Assembly and Executive. Human trafficking is modern-day  slavery, whereby human beings are treated as commodities by organised crime  gangs who make a substantial profit though buying and selling them. Recent  press coverage of trafficking that showed victims being rescued as part of a  UK-wide operation reminded us that such a heinous crime exists in Northern  Ireland. Today, we seek an assurance from the Minister of Justice that he will  put the issue high on his agenda.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The coalition Government have committed to tackling human  trafficking as a priority, and we should note that an anti-human-trafficking  co-ordinator is to be appointed in Wales. The new post will involve raising  awareness, uncovering the extent of the problem and bringing more traffickers  to justice. The proposed co-ordinator in Wales will also organise practical  training for professionals in how to identify and intervene in cases. I ask the  Minister of Justice to think about whether it would be possible for him to  consider the employment of such a champion in the criminal justice system here  in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Welsh Assembly&rsquo;s strategy states that human trafficking  is now the third most lucrative market, after drugs and firearms, for organised  criminals in the United Kingdom. It is worth emphasising that the fight against  the trafficking of human beings requires co-ordinated efforts with our  counterparts in Great Britain, across Europe and globally. It is clear that  human trafficking knows no borders, and the European Union has an important  role to play in combating it. My colleague Jim Nicholson MEP has written to the  Justice Minister and the Secretary of State for Justice, Ken Clarke. He asked  for their assessments of the draft EU directive on human trafficking to ensure  that the United Kingdom is doing all that it can to help the victims and to  bring the perpetrators to justice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The level of awareness of human trafficking needs  considerable attention in Northern Ireland. A report published by the Northern  Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Equality Commission in January 2010  indicated that human trafficking was an active but largely hidden problem in  Northern Ireland. Human trafficking has been a major global issue, but it has  only recently attracted public attention in Northern Ireland. The report  revealed a picture of the abuse and exploitation of women, children and men  from a range of ethnic backgrounds. The commissions have called for a  co-ordinated response to human trafficking and for more support for its  victims.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The information that was gathered during interviews for the  report provides evidence of the trafficking of women and children for the  purposes of sexual exploitation and forced labour, including domestic  servitude. Some information was also received on the trafficking of men for  labour exploitation. However, there was, unfortunately, significantly less data  on men and less knowledge among interviewees about that problem. The findings  of the study highlighted significant gaps in the knowledge of the extent and  nature of trafficking and showed that the system of data collection in Northern  Ireland was virtually non-existent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of equal concern was the limited and ad hoc nature of the  provision of services to victims of human trafficking here in Northern Ireland.  Although those gaps might now be being filled by organisations such as Women&rsquo;s  Aid and the Migrant Helpline, they should not have to do so alone, and the  provision remains inadequate. The information that was provided during  interviews indicated that such provision was largely made case by case. Often,  it depended on the goodwill and dedication of those who provided support and  services once a victim had been identified.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That report made six recommendations that were specific to  Northern Ireland, and I ask the Minister to provide his assessment to the House  on the matter. We all recognise the hard work of the PSNI and the valuable  contribution that it makes to combating organised crime. We further understand  that the PSNI is limited by today&rsquo;s economic pressures and constraints. We hope  that the Minister will do all that he can to facilitate the PSNI&rsquo;s needs in  combating the crime of human trafficking and that he will advise us today of  any resource problems that affect its success in that field.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also the Anti-Trafficking Monitoring Group, which  undertakes analysis to ensure that appropriate measures are being introduced to  protect trafficked persons. In June 2010, the group made the following  recommendations specifically for  Northern Ireland: the establishment of an all-Northern Ireland  human-trafficking group; the establishment of a localised national referral  mechanism in Northern Ireland; the develop&shy;ment of documents in different  languages to assist victims of trafficking; for the Public Prosecution Service to  provide guidance on human trafficking for all prosecutors in Northern Ireland;  the establishment of information-sharing protocols across devolved and  non-devolved Departments; and for the evaluation of the impact of the Blue  Blindfold campaign to be made public in 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Again, it is prudent that thought be given to such recommendations  and their implementation in order to combat the problem of human trafficking.  What does the Minister intend to do about those six recommendations? We  recognise that the implementation of such recommendations requires the  co-ordination of the whole Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Anti-Trafficking Monitoring Group highlighted that  responsibility for the co-ordination of services for victims of trafficking to  and in Northern Ireland does not fall to the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety, but to the Department of Justice. On that issue,  there is no ambiguity; it is clear. I am confident, having spoken to colleagues  from all parties in the Assembly, that we and they are very much committed to  combating human trafficking in all its forms. We need to bring together  devolved and non-devolved Departments and all other relevant and non-statutory  bodies to establish a coherent approach to combating human trafficking.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is a live issue in our streets and communities. We  know what is going on, and I do not think that our people are turning a blind  eye to it. This is a small place, and most people know what is going on. The  most shocking thing is not that it is happening but that people in our  community are availing themselves of those services. They should be ashamed of  themselves. They are not a reflection on the community that I work in, live in  and represent. The House should condemn them and them alone. If they do not do  business, there is no business.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the House for its attention, and look forward to  the Minister&rsquo;s response to the motion. I welcome the debate that we are about  to have.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: At end insert</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;; and further calls on the Minister of Justice to work  closely with the Irish Government and the European Union to ensure that  Northern Ireland is part of an all-island, European wide response to this  serious issue.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Mr McNarry and his colleagues for bringing the  motion to the House. It is timely. We are quickly approaching 18 October, which  has been designated anti-slavery day by the Prime Minister, Mr Cameron. It is  appropriate that we consider carefully the whole issue of human trafficking in  Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our amendment will enhance and expand the motion to  introduce a North/South dimension as well as a European dimension. In dealing  with human trafficking, it is important to realise that many of our borders are  now very porous and that it is much easier to traffic in human beings. That is  the reality of the situation. The international police services, and many  reports, indicate the ease with which trafficking can take place. People use  the various jurisdictions in order to evade detection by police services  throughout Europe, the UK and Ireland. It is important that we recognise that  there is not simply a Northern Ireland or UK dimension, but also an all-Ireland  and a European dimension. We should not ignore that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Public Accounts Committee&rsquo;s report on organised crime  in June 2010 focused partly on human trafficking. It noted that human  trafficking was on the rise in Northern Ireland and that it must be combated  robustly. I think that all Members will agree with that. In that report,  Assistant Chief Constable Drew Harris indicated that the PSNI was very  concerned about the steady increase in trafficking. Clearly, it is timely for  the Assembly to take note of the issue and introduce specific measures to deal  with it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr McNarry pointed out very rightly, some of our  responses to human trafficking and some of the services provided were on an ad  hoc basis. Data collection in relation to the issue is poor and can be  improved. It is clear that we need to up our game in that regard. Mr McNarry  also said that we are a small community and that people know what is going on.  We are a small community, but many people coming from abroad who speak a  foreign language and who are not conversant in English live in very tightly  knit groups in our community, albeit that it is a small community. It is very  difficult to penetrate certain ethnic groups because of language and all sorts  of additional social factors that prevent a real interface between those groups  and the wider community. There are difficulties in penetrating some of the  trafficking because of the nature of the people involved and the ethnic group  to which they belong. Therefore, it is very important that we try and develop  ways and means of penetrating that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, human trafficking is organised crime. Organised  criminals are very brutal, protective, secretive and ingenious in protecting their criminal operations, so  there are difficulties. The report entitled &lsquo;Crossing Borders: preliminary  research on human trafficking in Northern Ireland&rsquo;, which was produced by  Women&rsquo;s Aid, points out the geographic distinction of Northern Ireland. In some  ways, we are a staging post for human trafficking. If criminal operations do  not take place here, the criminals may use Northern Ireland as a staging post.  Therefore, we must be very vigilant and proactive in preventing those criminal  organisations operating in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other issue that creates vulnerability and greater  accessibility by human traffickers is the fact that we have increased our air  links with Europe and other parts of the world. That makes it much easier for  people to be trafficked into Northern Ireland and sent to the Republic, or vice  versa, or to other parts of the UK. We must be much more proactive in dealing  with those issues.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note with satisfaction that, in December 2008, the  previous Government signed up to the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Convention on Action  against Trafficking in Human Beings. That was a progressive step. However, a proposed  European Union directive on trafficking has yet to be fully implemented here,  and we in the Assembly should be pressing for that. It is important that it is  implemented fully here in Northern Ireland, because it would assist us in  co-operating with our European colleagues and with those in other states. It is  also important that we apply at least some pressure to the British Government  for an early implementation of that directive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I endorse what the Member who moved the motion said. I very  much agree with the detail of his speech, and I assure him of our support for  his motion, which is timely and should be welcomed. I hope that Mr McNarry and  his colleagues will accept the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: The  motion has been well brought by my Strangford colleague Mr McNarry. The subject  is a matter of the greatest outrage of our time: the trafficking of human  beings. We must honestly try to move away from the sanitised version of the  word &ldquo;trafficking&rdquo;. This is not trafficking, this is not business: this is the  forced sexual slavery, predominantly of women but also of men, into a life of  servitude against their will, causing massive long-term physical, psychological  and emotional consequences for the individuals involved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion contains everything necessary. I believe that  the amendment has probably been honourably proposed, and I hope that I do not  suggest in any way that it is an attempt to play politics with the issue.  However, we are dealing with not just a North/South body or a European issue.  As far away as Asia, and in many other areas, the trafficking of human beings  for sexual slavery is a fact, and it is a fact in Northern Ireland. The  amendment is encompassed in the motion, and, in the interest of uniting Members  in their support against sexual slavery, I think that it should be withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Where does that leave sexual slavery? Any of us who have  worked in the field of the psychology of victims of sexual crime will know  about the self-harm, the self-cutting and the self-loathing. We know of the  individuals who need to self-medicate to deal with the pain of what was  perpetrated against them. They self-medicate with alcohol and drugs, including  prescription drugs. The trauma of what they have experienced means that they  take medication just to get to sleep, and yes, Mr Speaker, unfortunately, in  many cases, victims of sexual slavery end up committing suicide.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I saw many such cases in my 21 years&rsquo; experience in social  work and while sitting on other professional bodies and arenas. Anyone who  looks into the eyes of somebody that they genuinely believe has been trafficked  from another country can see deadness and pain that have been caused by the  reality of what has happened to them. I am concerned to learn that in our  Northern Ireland, where we had a church on nearly every street corner, blessed  with the gospel, dozens of people have been forcibly transported into our  country against their will, subjected to violence and rape, to serve as sexual  slaves. I am referring to not one person or two, but to dozens, Mr Speaker, and  those are only the cases that we can prove. In many cases, any professional  working in that field will say that many other cases slip under the radar or  that there is not enough evidence to secure convictions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In our Northern Ireland of the twenty-first century, where  organised crime gangs spend &pound;50,000 plus just to advertise the slaves that they  have, we, as a society, should hang our heads in shame. Organised crime gangs  spent &pound;56,000 just on advertising the fact that they had slaves whom people  could use and abuse. We are moving to a time when, as a society, we need to  regain our moral compass. The House needs to initiate and spark a campaign of  the magnitude and ferocity of that fought by William Wilberforce against  slavery. As has rightly been said, human trafficking is nothing short of sexual  slavery.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Often, shame depresses action. Having spoken to the police  at Chief Constable and Assistant Chief Constable level, I can tell criminals  that time is running out for their organised crime gangs. They have brought  shame on our population. They have brought people into our community for the  purpose of sexual slavery, and, rather than being depressed out of action, we  should acknowledge the problem and rise above it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: We  should go forward with a William Wilberforce-style campaign to return human  dignity and to restore society&rsquo;s moral compass.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms M Anderson: Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. &Eacute;ir&iacute;m le  taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don mholadh seo.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and the amendment, and I thank the  proposers of both for the opportunity to speak. I am disappointed but not  surprised by the suggestion from the Member who spoke previously that the  amendment should be withdrawn. It would be shameful for the House to divide on  such an emotive issue, which is of grave concern to everyone across our  society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Cois Tine is an organisation that promotes the integration  of people from all communities and cultures in Ireland, and it defines human trafficking as:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring  or receipt of people for the purpose of exploitation. This includes persons  forced into prostitution or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour  or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal  of organs.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is a shocking definition; however,  unfortunately, it is accurate. As the motion suggests, trafficking is a  modern-day slave trade, and the fact that it is growing in prevalence here, as  the recent raids in Belfast have shown, is a cause of grave concern for  everyone in the Chamber and the communities that we come from. None of us  should be in any doubt that we could well be dealing with only the tip of the  iceberg, which means that we need to enter into wider discussions and  engagements after the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2008, the US  State Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;Trafficking in Persons Report&rsquo; stated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Ireland is a destination country for women, men and  children trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and  forced labor.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It goes on  to say that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Women from Eastern Europe, Nigeria, other parts of  Africa, as well as smaller numbers from South America and Asia, have reportedly  been trafficked to Ireland for forced prostitution.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In June, the Public Accounts Committee published its  &lsquo;Report on Combating Organised Crime&rsquo;, which was referred to earlier, and it  included evidence from senior police witnesses who warned of the growth of  human trafficking here and the misery that it is causing in our midst. Last  year, the PSNI identified 25 victims of human trafficking, and that figure has  grown since then. Of course, the secret and hidden nature of the crime means  that the real number of victims is likely to be much higher.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although trafficking for the sex trade is the most common  motive for the gangs involved, it should also be pointed out that other victims  are reportedly found carrying out domestic labour and restaurant and  agricultural work. Given the potential scale of the problem, it is clear that  the Assembly must take action, and I support fully the motion&rsquo;s call for:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the Minister of Justice and the Executive to raise  awareness of human trafficking among the public in order to assist the  authorities in securing prosecutions against those who carry out this modern  form of slavery&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the motion and the amendment suggest, there is a role  for the Minister to engage both on an all-Ireland basis and with Europe to  ensure that we get Ireland-wide and Europe-wide responses to such a serious  issue. Those are the kinds of working relationships and initiatives that were  reflected in the recommendations of a report on human trafficking that Women&rsquo;s  Aid published in 2006. I ask other Members who spoke, especially those from the  DUP, to reflect on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Minister of Justice will also take heed  of the issues that were raised in the Women&rsquo;s Aid report and of its contention  that a better legal framework is required to make perpetrators of violence and  abuse accountable to the law. I welcome developments such as the launch last  year of new support services for victims of human trafficking. As a member of  the Policing Board, I am aware that the PSNI, the Border Agency and the Garda  National Immigration Bureau are already working closely together to combat  human trafficking. Therefore, collaborative working on an all-Ireland basis  could easily be maximised without any great difficulty.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: The Member must bring her remarks to a  close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms M Anderson: As a society we must take more  cognisance of and be more aware of what is happening around us. We must ask  ourselves whether we want a society that is based on equality and fairness or  one that is based on exploitation and fear. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms Lo: As you are probably aware, Mr Speaker, I have a  particular interest in this topic, given my experience in working with ethnic  minority communities. I sincerely thank all Members who have spoken on this  issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and the amendment. Indeed, we should  be thinking about a worldwide, collective response to human trafficking,  because it is an internationally organised crime. As Mr McNarry said, it is the  third most profitable crime after drugs and firearms smuggling. A report from  the Immigrant Council of Ireland stated that a minimum of 1,000 women from 51  different nationalities are in indoor prostitution in Ireland at any one time.  Up to 97% of those women are migrant workers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre reported that,  between April and December 2009, 527 potential victims of trafficking from 61  nationalities were referred to the National Referral Mechanism. We have seen  the results of the UK-wide Pentameter 2 and the more recent Apsis police  operations. It is essential that there is co-operation with the Republic of  Ireland and the EU. Northern Ireland has been shown to be a transit route from  Dublin to the rest of the UK and vice versa. I was aware of a case involving a  young Chinese woman who was identified at the port at Stranraer as a trafficked  person and who had an address in Drogheda.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we should look even further afield than that.  There needs to be co-operation with countries of origin such as China, Nigeria,  Thailand and Vietnam, where the majority of trafficked victims come from. There  needs to be awareness-raising in those countries to avoid people being lured by  bogus advertisements to the wealthy West. The Governments in those places need  to crack down on the criminals so that they do not make money out of human  misery. They need to get tough on the criminals in their own countries.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need more understanding here in Northern Ireland. Human  trafficking is not just about sexual exploitation; it also takes the form of  domestic servitude and forced labour, as we saw in the cannabis factories that  were discovered in Northern Ireland and in other parts of the UK. It involves women,  men and children. I helped to launch the Blue Blindfold campaign, but we need  much more public awareness about the issue in order to help police make  detections.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Anti-Trafficking Monitoring Group report is very  critical of the UK Government&rsquo;s failure to address the entirety of the  Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. Much more needs to be  done on identification, protection, prosecution and prevention. We now have  some protection for women, and the Women&rsquo;s Aid refuge gives women a 45-day  reflection period.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to mention the increasing number of unaccompanied  minors. Some children are told by gangsters at our ports and airports to tell  people that they have been trafficked into the country. They are then scooped  up by social services and put in a bed and breakfast, only to disappear  immediately afterwards back into the hands of the criminals. We need a better  system to protect those children. We need to put them in proper places, such as  a children&rsquo;s home or into foster care, where there is proper protection,  supervision and support.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should bring her remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms Lo: The crux of the matter is that a big demand for  prostitution will be followed by supply. I call on the Minister to consider  legislation to prosecute those who pay for sex with trafficked people as being  a party to human trafficking. Furthermore, we should consider them liable for  prosecution for rape.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: The Business Committee has arranged to meet  immediately on the lunchtime suspension today. I propose, therefore, by leave  of the Assembly, to suspend the sitting until 2.00 pm. The first Member to  speak after lunchtime will be Mr Sydney Anderson.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.32 pm.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the  Chair) &mdash;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: As this is the first occasion on  which the Assembly will hear from Mr Sydney Anderson, I remind the House that  it is the convention that a maiden speech be made without interruption.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr S Anderson: It is an honour to make my maiden speech  as a DUP Member for Upper Bann, and I thank my party colleagues for choosing me  for the role. When I was chosen to succeed my good friend David Simpson, I  wondered how I could fill his shoes, because, as I am sure that Members will  agree, he is a big man. David&rsquo;s track record speaks for itself. He served the  House with distinction and continues his good work serving and representing the  constituents of Upper Bann in the House of Commons. I hope to continue with  that good work in the Assembly, and I wish David well for the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For my maiden speech, I could have chosen a much lighter  subject. I could have waited for an opportunity to sing the praises of Upper  Bann or to plead for more funding for its business, tourism, housing, education  or health sectors. I have no doubt that those chances will come, and I will  take every opportunity fully, but the issue of human trafficking is too  important. It is an issue that affects the whole of Northern Ireland. I do not  support the SDLP amendment, but I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have read of the history of slavery in our country and in  places such as the USA. I have read of the heroic battles of those who ended it  and set its victims free. My colleague Jonathan Bell mentioned William  Wilberforce, an evangelical Protestant who was driven by a tremendous  determination to overthrow the evil of slavery and to protect, defend and  support those who were oppressed by it. Indeed, Wilberforce once said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;If to be feelingly alive to the sufferings of my  fellow-creatures is to be a fanatic, I am one of the most incurable fanatics  ever permitted to be at large.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Is not slavery a thing of the past? We say that it does not  happen today, and certainly not in the United Kingdom, but to do that is to bury  our heads in the sand. Slavery, or human trafficking as it is now known, does  happen and on a large scale. It happens on our doorstep, and it is a shameful  blight on our nation. Recently, Chief Superintendent Roy McComb rightly  described it as &ldquo;modern-day slavery&rdquo; and &ldquo;obscene&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People from other countries are conned by evil people into  believing that they will help them to obtain a better life here, but, once they  are here, they are illegal immigrants without any rights and depend totally on  those who brought them. They lose all freedom and are forced to obey the will  of those who are in reality their owners, who are out only to make themselves  rich on the back of their suffering. The victims, mostly young women but also  men and, horrifyingly, young children, are tortured, abused and trapped and  treated as little more than pieces of meat. They are moved around to keep them  disorientated, and they have no one to whom to turn.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is vital that, in this place, we speak up for those  modern-day victims of this modern-day slave trade. We must not remain silent in  the face of such grim realities. I urge the key enforcement agencies across the  UK to do all in their power to improve the levels and flow of intelligence and  information. That is vital. It has been alleged that there are significant gaps  in knowledge about human trafficking in Northern Ireland. All the key players,  including government, police and the Public Prosecution Service, must work  together to deliver tangible results.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned that good police work does not always lead  to successful prosecutions. However, I congratulate the PSNI on its  contribution to the recent UK-wide Operation Apsis, which led to three arrests  and some 15 victims being freed in Belfast. We need more such successes, not  only in Belfast but in the rural areas of Northern Ireland and throughout our  towns, and we look forward to more successful prosecutions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, I quoted William Wilberforce, who confessed to  being fanatical about opposing slavery. We must share Wilberforce&rsquo;s fanatical  opposition to it and confront the great evil of human trafficking in our day  and in our land.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Through the centuries, there has  always been trafficking of some kind, but one would expect that, at this time,  the barbarity of the sex trade, slavery and exploitation would not be a growing  concern.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have got to look upon all human trafficking as  twenty-first century slavery, call it what it is and take the actions that will  deal with the problem. Although we can blame the recession for everything, it  is a truism that the pressures of recessionary times will be exploited by people  who will employ the exploitable for very poor wages or even none at all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a problem EU-wide and beyond, which is why it is very  strange that the DUP is speaking against the amendment. The amendment makes a  common sense addition to the motion. It is a bit like looking on the North as  the global village without the globe; there is obviously an all-Ireland issue  with European-wide dimensions and issues therein. I make it clear that we  support the motion and the common-sensical amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A better legal framework is needed. One would think, given  all the resources of the D&aacute;il, the Assemblies and the Parliaments, that these  islands could be better served in the work against human trafficking. There are  many local issues, and we have to pose questions and challenges not only to  agencies and Ministers but to ourselves as Members. The Human Rights Commission  report referred to the ad hoc approach. That is not good enough, and we need to  be better.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Women&rsquo;s Aid report referred to worries about police attitudes,  their failure to investigate and a lack of willingness to be proactive in  investigating the prostitution aspect of our human trafficking problem. Some  agencies do not ask whether victims have been trafficked, and there seems to be  a reticence to pursue the issue to see whether that is the problem on the  ground. The national referral mechanism has a GB slant but does not appreciate  the structures in the North. Is there enough of a meaningful, working  on-the-ground relationship between the PSNI, the Department of Health, trusts  and the Department of Justice? It is OK to talk about protocols and strategies,  but in dealing with this problem we will be judged by what happens on the  ground.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The NIO has an overarching role, but is there enough of a  working relationship with all the devolved agencies and those in Dublin? Has  there been a real, common sense linkage with the Dublin Administration? It is  extremely simple to arrive at any port in Ireland and move to any area of  Ireland. That is happening, and, therefore, it is ridiculous to exclude the  Dublin influence that the amendment outlines. There must be a close working  relationship with the Dublin Administration. People who have been given  permission in the South have been trafficked to the North to work. That hold is  put on people so that they do not report anything in their hours, days and  weeks of predicament.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have a dreadful situation of twenty-first century  slavery. We have to go beyond talking the talk and take meaningful,  co-ordinated and firm action. Too many people are affected, and too many  organisations that work with those affected say that co-ordination is not in  place. We, as an Assembly, and the Minister, must play our role in ensuring  that we work to achieve those aims and deal with this slavery problem.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  The last Member who spoke referred to our reluctance to support the amendment.  It is with some regret that we cannot support the amendment. Indeed, had the  amendment been a wee bit more explicit and direct, there would have been no  reason why we on these Benches would not have supported it. I ask the House to  take cognisance of the fact that the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment makes no mention  whatsoever of the United Kingdom Government. It is, however, very specific in  stating that the Minister of Justice should work closely with:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the Irish Government and the European Union to ensure  that Northern Ireland is part of an all-island, European wide response to this  serious issue.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Had the SDLP stopped and thought its way forward  and sought to unite the House around an amendment, I have no doubt that that  would have happened. I appeal to the SDLP, even at this late stage, to think  again on the amendment and support the motion tabled by Tom Elliott, David  McNarry and Mr Kinahan. In the main, the House agrees with the motion. If we  continue to try to politicise every issue in Northern Ireland, whether it comes  from one side or the other, we will lose sight of the real issues, and that  would be regrettable, given the gravity of this matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>The previous Member  to speak said something that is very true</strong>: we will be judged on how the  situation works out on the ground. That is exactly how we will be judged. We  will not be judged on the fine words or the fine politicking that was brought  in either to confuse or score a couple of silly, cheap, political points over  political opponents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The briefing paper said that trafficking happens mainly in  Belfast, and that is probably true, but it goes on to say that <strong>places such as Londonderry and Newry are  also noted for having the problem. However, the problem goes much further</strong>:  it goes into our provincial towns.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I work closely with the PSNI in my town, and I congratulate  them on the fine work that they have done, albeit it very slowly. Nevertheless,  eventually we got a satisfactory result. It was patently obvious that  trafficking was going on in houses of ill repute, which is the only way that I  can put it. However, through the tedious, hard work of the local PSNI, we were  able to bring that to a conclusion. Many neighbours who had made representation  to me and, I suspect, to others, were in despair at times due to the length of  time it took to close down those establishments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the House to support the motion, as it is an honest  attempt to get to the heart of the problem. Human trafficking is a totally  distasteful business &mdash; there is no other word that I would want to put on it &mdash;  that feeds criminal activity and destroys the lives of the individuals who are  subject to the illegal trades. Human trafficking exists because of greed and  power. However, I understand the sentiment expressed in the motion, because  without a demand for prostitution and drugs, there would be no trade.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The majority of those trafficked to Northern Ireland are  forced into a dark world of prostitution; they are often kept captive by  threats of blackmail, or worse, should they try to escape. It is a grotesque,  vicious trade, often aided by an ample supply of heavy drugs on which victims  become dependent. Yet again, that is another example of power.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those who coerce individuals into believing that a new and  plush life awaits them if they agree to travel to Northern Ireland are  exercising power over susceptible people who fall prey to the assurance of a  new life. As we saw in the media, the results are far from glamorous. Terrified  illegal immigrants who dare not open their mouths to protest &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: Will the Member draw his remarks to  a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Lord Morrow: I will close now, Mr Deputy Speaker. As  the gang leaders hold the trump cards, those people cannot obtain legitimate  work as they have no visas or permits and are entirely bound by their captives.  I strongly commend the motion to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Elliott: I thank my colleagues for bringing forward  this important motion. In February 2010, the Northern Ireland Office announced  that 18 men, women and children had been rescued in recent years in Northern  Ireland. I am concerned by the fact that if 18 people were rescued, how many  more go unnoticed? How many more of those crimes go unpunished? That is the  real issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">After a successful UK-wide operation just two weeks ago,  which included the Police Service of Northern Ireland and raids across Northern  Ireland, another 15 victims were rescued. I welcome that.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Human trafficking is growing in prominence throughout the  Province and occurs in urban and rural areas. I note Lord Morrow&rsquo;s comments  that many believe that it occurs only in larger towns or cities or in regional  towns. It is actually prevalent in smaller towns and villages throughout Northern  Ireland, and, although we think of it as a crime that affects only urban areas,  it is more widespread than that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Human trafficking is barbaric. It is the slavery of modern  times, and human beings &mdash; men, women and children &mdash; are treated as commodities  and are bought and sold as slaves. I am deeply alarmed that adults and children  are trafficked for domestic servitude and for labour and sexual exploitation in  the heart of Northern Ireland. It would appear that those criminals who used to  move around drugs and other smuggled goods are now moving human beings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have read some case studies and know that victims&rsquo;  personal experiences are deeply upsetting. There is no place in a civilised  society for those who take people&rsquo;s liberty, freedom and individual choice and  coerce them to work in horrific conditions in which they are subject to extreme  intimidation, oppression and sexual violence. Many victims have been conned by  fake advertisements for jobs as nannies, hairdressers or domestic workers. They  are vulnerable people from around the world, from areas such as China, Africa  and Europe, who are unwittingly thrust into the underground sex trade or other  forms of servitude. Human trafficking is undoubtedly one of today&rsquo;s most  depraved crimes. It is utterly destructive to its victims and to society as a  whole.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Detective Chief Superintendent Roy McComb of the PSNI has  said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Human trafficking and prostitution is no longer  gender specific. Men and women are being tricked or forced into prostitution in  major towns and cities.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">An international report also commented that the  border between Northern Ireland and the Republic is an attractive getaway for  child traffickers. Co-operation should improve that situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been said that the issue should not be publicised  and that people should keep quiet about it because it creates a bad public  perception of small towns or villages. I am of the opposite view and feel that  the issue must be publicly highlighted and put into the media. We are public  representatives and, together with members of the community, must ensure that  human trafficking is stopped by helping the agencies that are trying to stop  it. I work with various agencies in my constituency and know that much of that  work goes unheard of. The more that we highlight the issue of human  trafficking, the more people will realise the seriousness of the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask that Members do not allow the issue to be kept  underground. Let us and the public highlight it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  support the motion and the amendment, which supplements the motion in a useful  and significant way. All Members who spoke during the debate referred to the  scourge of human trafficking as a modern form of slavery. However, many of the  victims of that trafficking do not experience much that is modern in the life  and conditions that they suffer. They effectively live as the bonded property  of those who control them, and they are controlled in various ways such as  having their passports removed, being made to live in fear and not having the  freedom to escape their situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All of us are rightly shocked and appalled at that and will  want to unite in condemnation and action against it. The motion and the  amendment are helpful because they give us some important pointers, and they  set a real benchmark for the Assembly. However, we have to ensure that as well  as asking the Minister of Justice to take forward certain issues, as the motion  does, and asking for things to be dealt with on a North/South and European  level, as the amendment does, we must look seriously at what other laws and  policies in many ways enable the existing degree of trafficking. We must  question whether some of the moves and changes in immigration are just creating  a greater fear factor that is exploited by those who are in the business of  trafficking and are allowing people to control a larger underworld in ethnic  communities than would otherwise be the case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion rightly refers to the fact that human  trafficking exists because of local demand, but we do not go much further than  acknowledging that. As Anna Lo indicated in her remarks, more needs to be done  in law to recognise the end-user of those victims as part of the chain of abuse  and exploitation. Therefore, paying for sex with people who have been  trafficked should be a specific criminal offence. We need to address the chain  of abuse the whole way to its end. There is no point in condemning the  invisible traffickers if we do not condemn those who exploit and use people who  are in utter misery. As long as we hold back on that, we are sending an  ambiguous signal. That is a challenge not just to this legislature but to all  legislatures on these islands.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note what some DUP Members said about the amendment, and  I specifically acknowledge Sydney Anderson&rsquo;s very compelling maiden speech.  Those Members spoke against the amendment as though it is somehow untoward, but  it is a practical and useful supplement to the motion. We are not saying that  trafficking and trans-jurisdictional issues occur only across the border  between the North and the South. We recognise that those issues apply  throughout these islands. That is why we welcomed Operation Apsis and  Pentameter 2.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the House of Commons, I serve as honorary treasurer of  the all-party group on human trafficking, and we continually talk to police and  other agencies in various parts of the UK about this issue. Therefore, we have  no fear about action at that level. However, we need to see real action  throughout these islands, including on the island of Ireland, which is what the  amendment points to. We also fully support action at a British-Irish level and  want to see the matter addressed at the British-Irish Council and at the  British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly. We will take our own steps in that  regard, along with others. Therefore, I appeal to Members to support the  amendment, which does not contradict or detract in any way from the very  important motion that has been tabled by Mr Elliott, Mr McNarry and Mr Kinahan.  Let us demonstrate a strong united view in the House to show that we take the  issue seriously. Maybe then our views will be taken seriously.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I apologise for not being in the  Chamber at the outset of the debate, but I was on other Assembly business.  Thank you for your indulgence in calling me to speak this afternoon. I have, of  course, heard some of the debate, and I have been very impressed. I thank all  the Members who brought forward the motion and the amendment, and I want to add  my voice of support to the motion as amended. The amendment is a logical  follow-on. Mark Durkan made the point adequately that it is just a logical  extension to the work that is advocated in the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of PSNI officers travelled to Brussels to speak to  the European Commission and Members of the European Parliament about this  matter. Indeed, my colleague Bairbre de Br&uacute;n, who is an MEP, and I met a number  of officers to discuss what might be done by way of engagement with Brussels. That  speaks for itself. Obviously, the officers represent the PSNI, which is charged  with trying to eradicate the trade. They are anxious that we work to address  the problem of human trafficking and exploitation, not exclusively in the  North, but on a cross-border and, indeed, a transnational basis. Therefore, I  support the amendment strongly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to point out that no more than a couple of  years ago, prior to Operation Pentameter, the PSNI said publicly, and privately  to Policing Board members, that it did not consider that there was any  discernable human-trafficking problem. That is interesting. Thankfully, the  PSNI has been proactive in addressing the problem that exists. I want to put on  record that I welcome its recent activities to track down those who are  responsible for human trafficking. As has already been pointed out by Members  in the Chamber, a number of men, women and children have been rescued from that  dreaded trade. It is important to acknowledge that work is ongoing. Clearly,  human trafficking has been exposed as an iniquitous trade that is being  practiced on our very doorsteps. It is a public scandal that, in this day and  age, that type of activity is happening in our cities, towns and villages.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>Tom Elliott is  correct</strong>: it is important that the practice is exposed rather than brushed  under the carpet or somehow kept hidden. It is crucial that, as the motion  states, awareness of human trafficking is raised among the public. All those  who are deemed to be involved in that trade must be brought to book. It is  important to acknowledge the good work that is being done to support people who  are rescued from that trade, although much more is needed. Some work is already  under way to help them to overcome that trauma, pick up the pieces of their  lives, and deal with the consequences. We understand that many of those people  face stark and difficult choices, not least because they must deal with threats  to their families in other countries.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I support the motion and the amendment. I appeal  to Members to do likewise despite whatever minor technical issues might be  drawn to their attention. The essence of the issue is that a shocking trade is  going on under our noses in our towns and villages, and all around us. It is  simply unthinkable that that type of trade is being practised and people are  being trafficked and victimised in that manner in 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must do everything we can to bring the matter to public  attention and raise awareness. In particular, the message must reach people who  want to avail themselves of those so-called services, whom Mark Durkan  described as &ldquo;end-users&rdquo;. Clearly, there is a great deal of responsibility on  their shoulders. If they are aware, in any way, that people are being coerced  into certain roles, they are guilty of serious crimes. Undoubtedly, they must  also be brought to book.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend all people who are anxious to bring that trade to  public attention and, more importantly, to tackle it and to rescue people from  trafficking. The full rigours of the law must be brought to bear on all who are  engaged in such nefarious activity.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: As Question Time commences at 2.30  pm, I ask Members to take their ease until that time. The debate will continue  after Question Time, when the next Member to speak will be the Minister of  Justice.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Health, Social Services and Public  Safety</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading"><strong>NHS</strong>:  Republic of Ireland Patients</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr  Irwin </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety what  is the estimated annual cost to the Health Service of treating patients from  the Republic of Ireland. (AQO 89/11<a name="AQO89/11" id="AQO89/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: Free health  entitlement here for a person from the Republic of Ireland or any other member  state depends on the nature of their stay; for example, whether it is temporary  or long-term. Persons from the Republic of Ireland on a temporary visit can  avail themselves of free immediately necessary treatment under the European  health insurance card scheme. Cross-border workers are automatically entitled  to access free health services here, similar to Northern Ireland residents.  Information is not available on the cost of treating such patients.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his response. I am surprised that he has no idea of the  cost involved. I would have thought that a cost would automatically be  relevant, especially in the difficult financial climate in which we find  ourselves. Does the Minister also have no idea how that cost compares with the  cost of treating people from Northern Ireland in the Irish Republic? Does he  have no idea of the costs either way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety: I like the way that Mr Irwin said that I have &ldquo;no idea&rdquo;. I can certainly  give an estimate, but he asked for a specific figure, and I said that the  information is not retained. We are talking about very small numbers of people.  For example, there is information showing that there are around 1,000 inpatient  episodes, but I have not broken down the costs. We are certainly not talking  about large sums of money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People going from here to the Irish Republic can also avail  themselves of free immediately necessary treatment under the European health  insurance card scheme, just as they can if they go to Spain on holiday. It is a  general arrangement within the European Community under the European social  security regulations. Because we are part of Europe, we pay attention to that  arrangement and benefit from it. I suggest to the Member that more people from  Northern Ireland are likely to be cross-border workers in the Irish Republic  than the other way round. I would be amazed if the arrangement were not at  least cost-neutral, or perhaps we gain, but, as I said, those are estimates.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Given that we live on a small island  and that there are huge inefficiencies in running back-to-back health services,  does the Minister not agree that more co-operation with the South is logical?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I do not agree that there are  huge inefficiencies in running back-to-back health services. Let me remind the  Member that we operate a health service that is free at the point of delivery:  a British health service. That is what I am fighting to hold on to in the face  of all the cuts that I have been receiving in the House and the cuts still to  come from London.  In the Irish Republic, when people go to the GP, they  pay for it. If they go to A&amp;E, they pay for it. If they spend a night in  hospital, they pay for it. If they get a prescription, they pay for it. If they  get drugs on prescription, they pay for them. The Member is not comparing like  with like. Yes, payment exemptions are available in the Irish Republic,  but roughly one third of the population are entitled to those exemptions while  two thirds pay very large sums of money. The services are not back to back. We  are not comparing like with like, and in no way would I suggest that we are  running two inefficient health services.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I note the Minister&rsquo;s comment that we have much more to gain by working  together across the island, particularly on health issues. Will the Minister  join me in welcoming the commitment from the Government in the Republic of Ireland to financially support the  development of a radiotherapy centre at Altnagelvin? It will treat people  throughout the entire north-west, indeed throughout most of the island, and  will be of benefit to all.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: My position on the satellite  cancer centre at Altnagelvin   Hospital is well known,  and I have repeated it on number of occasions. I am in favour of working with  the Irish Republic  when we can see that there are benefits from doing so for the population in Northern Ireland.  The Member will be aware that I am working on a number of proposals, one of which  is the satellite cancer centre at Altnagelvin. That is at business case level  at the minute. I am very much in favour of the centre, but it will depend on  the eventual Budget settlement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his earlier commercial on behalf of the Irish Republic.  Will he comment on the investment from the Republic  of Ireland&rsquo;s Government in the  satellite radiotherapy unit at Altnagelvin   Hospital that he just  referred to? What will be the potential benefits of that project?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The potential benefits include  increased capacity. We anticipate that the centre at the Belfast City   Hospital will be at  capacity by 2015, so we need to expand. This is a geographical issue as much as  anything else. It will save patients in the north-west, particularly those who  travel to the cancer centre one, two or even three times a week, a lot of  unnecessary travel time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the support from the Government in the Irish  Republic, Donegal is outside their easy-to-access circle, so they will put in  money for capital and revenue and will pay costs on a pro rata basis. That will  help us and will lead to our service being more sustainable, because we will  end up with a centre that is larger and more robust.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Tobacco Advertising</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. Mr Wells asked the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety if and when he will introduce measures to control  the point-of-sale advertising of tobacco products. (AQO 90/11<a name="AQO90/11" id="AQO90/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I sought approval from Executive  colleagues in December 2009 to issue for public consultation draft regulations  banning the point-of-sale display of tobacco products. All Ministers, with the  exception of the First Minister, have given their approval for that  consultation. My primary aim in introducing that new legislation is to prevent  children and young people from taking up the smoking habit. The earlier those  measures are introduced, the more people we will save from a premature death  caused by smoking. Given that nine months have elapsed since initial Executive  approval was sought, I have recently instructed my Department to proceed with a  12-week consultation on the draft regulations.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Does the Minister accept that smoking is the most frequent avoidable cause of  death in Northern Ireland, that 2,500 people died last year as a direct result  of smoking and that the argument put forward by retailers about the rapid  implementation of the point-of-display ban is no longer relevant because they  have now had sufficient warning about the need to change their displays as a  result of the delays outlined?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mrs Michelle O&rsquo;Neill &mdash; I am sorry, Minister.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety: Mr Deputy Speaker, when you said &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;, I noticed that Mrs O&rsquo;Neill  could not wait to get up.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I completely agree with the Chairperson of the Health  Committee&rsquo;s remarks. Lung cancer caused by smoking is the single biggest  avoidable cause of death, and around 2,500 people die from it each year. In Northern Ireland,  almost 9% of children aged between 11 and 16 smoke regularly. Most smokers pick  up the habit when they are in that age group. We are looking at that  legislation because surveys have shown that children are particularly  susceptible to point-of-sale displays. I remind the House that vending machines  will also be included in the ban because they are another ready source of  cigarettes for youngsters. We are now going ahead with the consultation.  Consultations have now been completed in England,  Scotland and Wales. The ban  is already law in the Irish Republic, Canada and some other countries.  There have been very high compliance rates with that, and it has been shown  that that is having an effect on that cohort of children.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McCarthy: Will the Minister comment on the scare  stories being put out by certain people that prohibiting point-of-sale displays  of tobacco products will substantially increase the illegal practice of  smuggling those products?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety: We are prohibiting the advertising of the display itself. I am not  suggesting at this point that we ban the sale of cigarettes. However, we are  banning displays. Any shop or retailer that sells cigarettes always has a huge  display at the till advertising cigarettes, and children are particularly  susceptible to that type of suggestive advertising.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs O&rsquo;Neill: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. The Minister addressed my original question. However, is he aware  that, in the Twenty-six Counties, the Government brought in a ban on  point-of-sale advertising in July 2009? I read recently that preliminary  findings suggest that the effect of that ban on retailers has not been as bad  as originally predicted. Has the Minister had any negotiations with the  Twenty-six County Government on that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety: I have had discussions on the subject with Mary Harney in the margins  of North/South meetings. The Irish   Republic introduced a ban  in the summer of 2009. It has had a very high compliance rate and is reporting  a very good effect, in that fewer children are taking up smoking.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are many measures that we need to take. As Jim Wells  said, around 2,500 people die from lung cancer each year in Northern Ireland  as a result of smoking. Lung cancer is the single biggest avoidable cause of  death, and, therefore, the ban on displays is crucial. Although there have been  scare stories about how much money it will cost retailers to get rid of  displays, the cost will, in fact, be very small.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading"><strong>DHSSPS</strong>:  Budget</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr  McNarry </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for  an assessment of his Department&rsquo;s budgetary position. (AQO 91/11<a name="AQO91/11" id="AQO91/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: My Department faces the worst  financial environment since the creation of the Health Service in 1948. The  Executive&rsquo;s decision to impose &pound;113 million cuts on my in-year budget has had a  clear impact on waiting times. I am deeply concerned that, without additional  funding from the centre, I may have to make cuts to front line services to  manage my budget this year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Looking ahead, I can see that my budget will face even  worse times. Using the Executive&rsquo;s planning figures and our best assessment of  the costs that we will face in the next four years, I have calculated that the  financial challenge during the next CSR period will be around &pound;1&middot;5 billion  against an existing budget of &pound;4&middot;3 billion. That is twice the scale of the  efficiencies that I have delivered during the current CSR period. In my view,  that is simply an unrealistic budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Thinking ahead to the comprehensive spending review of 20 October 2010, if the  services in Northern Ireland that are in the Health Minister&rsquo;s remit are not  protected, as those in England and Wales will be, what does he predict will  happen to standards of service delivery in the Northern Ireland Health Service?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Health Service here is  clearly already under great stress, with demand continuing to rise against a  flat budget. Although we are making great strides and gains in efficiencies,  the reality is that, if we do not get the ring-fencing that is happening in England, Scotland  and Wales, there will no  longer be a British health service in Northern   Ireland, because we will have broken the link with the  rest of the United Kingdom.  As a result, we would see major deterioration in our ability to service the  health and social care needs of our population, and our Health Service would  not be on a par with those in England,  Scotland and Wales.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Obviously, the Minister will vigorously defend his Department&rsquo;s position, and, of  course, we all should endeavour to oppose cuts where possible. However, on the  realistic basis that reductions of some kind are inevitable, if the Minister  determines that he is to be exempt from cuts, has he, around the Executive  table, examined where those cuts may fall?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: If Mr Campbell cares to look at  the latest Treasury figures, which were produced in July 2010, he would see a  comparison of Northern Ireland  with other Administrations in the United Kingdom. On an index of 100,  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Health  Service is the worst-funded health service in the whole of the United Kingdom, receiving less funding than  those in England and Wales and falling a long way behind funding in Scotland. The  reality is that the Health Service is underfunded before we even start.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Remember, I am the only Minister who has delivered RPA and  the efficiencies that went with that, including &pound;700 million of so-called  efficiencies this year &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.] </span>I am sorry  that Mr Campbell cannot listen and feels obliged to talk from a sedentary  position. Most people in Northern    Ireland have heard what I have to say and  the case that I have been making over and over. You would need to be deaf not  to have noticed. These matters have been discussed at the Executive, and I  continue to make that case. However, the Executive and the House have to make  certain decisions, because a number of other Departments, it could be argued,  on a head-to-head basis with the rest of the UK are overfunded.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Will the Minister explain the rationale for an in-year reduction in the budget  allocation to GPs? Does he believe that GPs can stand that budget reallocation  without any reduction in front line service?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As far as GPs are concerned, I  regret having to make any such reductions. However, we are faced with cuts laid  on to us by the Executive. For example, cuts from swine flu: I asked for &pound;42  million and got &pound;5 million, so there is a cut. In addition, my pro rata share  of the so-called black hole is &pound;113 million. That all adds up to a need to make  reductions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I took the view that GPs have an administrative tail and,  if we are making reductions in administration right across the board, they  cannot be exempt. While some have complained, most have simply got on with it  and continue to do an excellent job.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. When making an assessment of the departmental budget,  did the Minister take account of the &pound;54 million that was paid out in bonuses  to health consultants?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety: We do not pay bonuses. However, there are merit awards for consultants  who make exemplary advances in their particular work area. That is a UK-wide  settlement. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland considered that we  should go forward with a review. The previous Government did not agree with us.  This Government do, and a review is under way. Of course, all moneys are taken  into account.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Downe Hospital:  Maternity Unit</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr Lunn </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to outline  the extent of usage of the midwifery-led maternity unit at the Downe Hospital  since it opened. &nbsp;(AQO 92/11<a name="AQO92/11" id="AQO92/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The midwife-led unit at Downe Hospital  officially opened on 22 March 2010. Even before that date, a wide range of  antenatal and post-natal care was available at the site, including  consultant-led and midwife-led clinics, with over 4,000 attendances during  2009-2010. Since the official opening of the midwife-led unit there have been  23 births, and another 83 are booked to the end of March 2011, putting the unit  well ahead of the hoped-for 50 births during the first year of operation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Lunn: I thank the Minister for his answer. If he  says that it is well ahead of expectation, I have to accept that, but it does  seem like a very low figure. A similar unit is planned for Lagan Valley   Hospital in two or three  years&rsquo; time. Has he any concerns about the effect on surrounding hospitals if  that unit is similarly underused and not recommended by local professionals?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety: Maybe Mr Lunn did not hear what I said to him, which is that the unit  is well ahead of the hoped-for 50 births during the first year of operation,  and we consider that that will continue to increase. I am very pleased at the  way the Downe Hospital midwife-led unit has come  forward, and we expect over 300 births annually at Downe within the next three  years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is wrong also to say that a similar unit is  planned for Lagan Valley Hospital  in the next few years; there is one planned for Lagan Valley   Hospital that will open  in February. We are working on the refurbishment of the unit now. It will be a  midwife-led unit. I also have plans, subject to capital availability, for a  newbuild development on the Lagan   Valley site, because I  believe that there is a big future there for maternity.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms Ritchie: There is absolutely no doubt that the  midwifery-led unit at the new Downe   Hospital is a success  story, and the number of births that have already taken place and those  projected clearly highlight that. However, I want to ask a question that  centres on other services at the Downe   Hospital. Will the  Minister, along with the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust, ensure  that all steps are taken to ensure that existing services are sustained and new  services are provided so that the principle of local accessibility at the point  of delivery is adhered to?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Ms Ritchie has made a number of  points. She is well aware that there is a consultation ongoing on the Downe Hospital,  and it would be wrong for me to comment before that consultation is completed  and recommendations have come forward. The consultation refers to acute  psychiatric beds and the 24-hour, consultant-led emergency department being  changed to a minor injuries unit. That is what the consultation is about. There  are also plans for a number of services that are not currently available to be  made available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Downe   Hospital is a designated  local hospital and has a strong future. Around 70% of the hospital needs of the  area will be provided by the hospital. It is brand new and cost &pound;64 million. I  am just sorry that, the day I went down to open it, Ms Ritchie decided to lead  a protest outside. It is a long time since I was protested at, but I have never  been protested at for spending &pound;64 million.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  The Lagan Valley obstetric-led unit caters for  somewhere in the region of 1,000 births. It is anticipated that the  midwifery-led unit will cater for 500 births. Will the Minister give an  assurance that the safety of mothers will be paramount in the arrangements  being taken forward, that the mothers who have to give birth in hospitals  outside their local area will be accommodated and that the capacity exists for  those births to take place?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety:  Had he been a Member for some time, the Member would know that I continually  say that quality plus safety equals outcome plus efficiency. Quality and safety  are always paramount in our minds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a strong future for the maternity unit in Lagan Valley,  and I look forward to that development. The reality is that an obstetric-led  unit on such low numbers cannot sustain the type of expertise that we require.  Therefore, the recurrent theme is to ensure that we have the proper cover for  our patients. As I said, quality plus safety equals outcome plus efficiency.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr Weir is not in his place to ask question 5.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Sexual Abuse Counselling</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. Ms S Ramsey asked the Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety for his assessment of sexual abuse  counselling services within the Health Service. (AQO 94/11<a name="AQO94/11" id="AQO94/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: All health and social care  trusts provide counselling services for survivors of sexual abuse. Those  services are provided either directly by health and social care trust staff or  through contracts with the Nexus Institute regionally and other local voluntary  service providers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sexual abuse can be disclosed by children, young people and  adults in the course of many Health Service interventions. Therefore, support  can be an integral part of child and family services, mental health services  and psychological services. As part of the sexual violence strategy, work has  been undertaken to improve access to counselling services and to reduce waiting  times, which are variable across the Province.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. There should be only one Member on his or her feet.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms S Ramsey: Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister  for his response. Given the recent revelations about the McDermott brothers and  other cases over the past number of months, it is important that services are  delivered for both victims and survivors. I know that the Minister will agree  with that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I asked for an assessment of abuse counselling across the  North, but I did not get that. Does the Minister believe that the sexual abuse  counselling services are adequate? I am not saying that one case is more  important than another, but, when there are revelations about a case like the  one in Donagh, are money and resources available to let the system kick in when  it is needed?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Of course I would like to do  more, and, if I had more money, I would spend more. The task is to juggle  various priorities. We have the sexual abuse strategy. We have reviewed how we  operate that strategy, which has led to a major advance: we have gone from 80%  not attending to 20% not attending. That is a dramatic change in a very  sensitive area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the other areas that I am looking at is flexibility  of spend; in other words, the regional commissioning that will allow the Nexus  Institute to move moneys around the Province. That will be another major  support to the Nexus Institute. That organisation had more than 5,000 enquiries  last year, and it delivered 9,500 counselling services. That sounds a lot, but  the problem is bigger, and if I had the resources I would devote more to it.  However, I am trying to manage as efficiently as we can the resources that we  are devoting to it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Will the Minister join me in paying tribute to the members of my former  profession who provide that counselling? Will he ensure that they themselves  get the appropriate supervision and care, so that we care for the carers to  allow them to do one of the most difficult jobs in family and childcare: the  counselling of children traumatised by sexual exploitation?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I readily join Mr Bell and  support the comments he has made. Social workers have a very difficult task to  perform. They do it professionally and well, and they are often the subject of  unfair criticism. I have nothing but admiration for them, and I give them  whatever support I can.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Beggs: Does the Minister accept that the voluntary  sector is often well placed to reach out to victims and survivors? It can also  provide value for money and, in many instances, be more accessible to those who  have suffered abuse.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety: I completely agree with Mr Beggs. The voluntary and community sector  has a crucial role to play, and we see it not simply in sexual violence  strategy but also in areas such as suicide prevention and the &lsquo;Protect Life&rsquo; strategy.  It has an absolutely crucial role right across the board in many activities of  the Health Service.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs M Bradley: The counselling service is most welcome,  and it does an excellent job for those who need it. Can the Minister tell me  whether there have been any reviews of the delivery of those services recently?  When was the last review carried out?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety: In 2008, we reviewed the position on counselling services as part of  developing the sexual violence strategy. As I indicated to Ms Ramsey, one of  the results was an increase in the number of people keeping their appointments  &mdash; a dramatic change from 80% of people not attending to 20% not attending.  Also, we are going forward with regional commissioning to allow the money to be  used flexibly right across the Province. That, too, will be a major gain for  counselling services.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Health: North/South Feasibility Study</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Mr  Durkan </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety if  and when he will make a statement on the report on the North/South feasibility  study on health issues. (AQO 95/11<a name="AQO95/11" id="AQO95/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As I advised the Assembly during  my statement on 14 September regarding the NSMC meeting in health and food  safety sectoral format held in June, Minister Harney and I are agreed that the  flexibility study should not be published and that our Departments should  continue to work together, as they have done throughout my time in office, on  projects which will deliver tangible benefits for people in each jurisdiction.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  welcome what the Minister said earlier about endorsing the rationale for  radiotherapy services to serve the greater north-west in the future. Does the  Minister not recognise that this study is in the public interest and should not  be treated as the private property of himself and the Minister from the South?  It should be published so that we can see what investments can be made together  at this time of great challenge for the public purses both North and South, so  that we can plan services for the future together, achieve economies of scale  and provide a real platform for commitment to quality and safety into the  future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Publication of the report would  require me to get the agreement of Ms Harney and of the Executive. The report  has been leaked, and it is on the Internet. Andy Pollak has it on his website.  I assume that the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin leaked it &mdash; that is my assumption, and  it is an educated assumption.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not need the extra bureaucracy to do what is required,  which is, as I pointed out, where there are tangible benefits for people in  each jurisdiction, to proceed on a case-by-case basis. When the Member looks up  the website, he will see the priorities that he mentioned: child protection;  radiotherapy at Altnagelvin   Area Hospital;  suicide prevention; the flu pandemic; cancer research and the Cancer  Consortium; GP out-of-hours services; and paediatric and congenital cardiac  services. All those are familiar, because that is the work that I do. I do not  need an all-Ireland survey to help me to do that. I work on a case-by-case  basis.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading"><strong>PSNI</strong>:  Hearing Loss Claims</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. Mrs McGill asked the Minister of Justice what  resources his Department has to deal with ongoing claims against the PSNI for  hearing loss. (AQO 104/11<a name="AQO104/11" id="AQO104/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice (Mr Ford)</strong>: Under the terms of the financial package for the  devolution of policing and justice powers that was negotiated with the then  Prime Minister by the First Minister and the deputy First Minister, the  Treasury agreed to meet sums required for claims above &pound;12 million each year  through access to the reserve on the basis of agreement on the litigation  strategy. I am in discussion with the Department of Finance and Personnel about  the first &pound;12 million of costs this year. When the Chancellor of the Exchequer  announced the Budget on 22 June, he confirmed that the financial package was  protected.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  answer. Given the financial constraints and budgetary difficulties, will he  assure the House today that the processes will be robust and the awards  justified?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank the Member for her supplementary question. I assure her  that the process is and will continue to be robust. Each claim is individually  assessed to ensure appropriate treatment for the claimant and the best  protection for the public purse.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  To date, has the Minister had discussions with his Executive colleague on  hearing loss? If so, do they agree on the valuation methodology that is  outlined in the Hillsborough agreement?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: No, I have not had discussions with my Executive colleagues. I can  only assume that, as the First Minister and the deputy First Minister were  involved in the negotiations for the package, it would achieve broad agreement  in the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Givan: It is an important issue, but I have studied  the figures, and the Minister forecasts that, next year, in the region of &pound;32  million will be paid out. Almost half of that will be spent on legal and  professional fees. Should that not be taken into account and consideration  given to whether that amount can be trimmed back?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Justice: I understand the Member&rsquo;s  concern about so much of the money being spent on legal and various other  professional fees that are associated with the claims. I was advised that that  process was adopted to ensure that the claims were treated robustly, properly  and on merit. It is a significant sum of money, but the alternative might have  been something like a class action, which would have resulted in a  significantly higher cost to the public purse.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Dissident Republicans</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr S  Anderson </strong>asked the Minister of Justice what meetings he has had in the last  two months in relation to dissident republican activity. (AQO 105/11<a name="AQO105/11" id="AQO105/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Over the period in question, I have held discussions on all elements  of the security situation, republican and loyalist, with NIO Ministers, the  Chief Constable and the security services. I have also reviewed east-west and  North/South security co-operation with Theresa May and Dermot Ahern  respectively. In all those discussions, I was struck by the range, extent and  co-ordination of the measures being taken across agencies to counter the  current threat.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Terrorist activity from whichever quarter aims to undermine  the work of the Assembly; to divide the police from the community; to damage  the economy; and to seek control through fear and intimidation. I am determined  to do all that I can to ensure that the police have the necessary resources to  deal with the threat posed by terrorists, republican and loyalist alike. However,  it is important to recognise that there is a wider response beyond that which  policing can offer. We must continue to make progress on behalf of all the  people of Northern Ireland  through the work of the Executive and the Assembly to promote a shared future,  to tackle the problems that our communities face and to maximise the impact of  our programmes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have also held a number of discussions with groups and  individuals who have taken an interest in the arrangements for the separated  republican prisoners in Maghaberry prison.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. As we all know, dissident republican  activity takes many forms: one is the flouting of the laws on legal parades and  protests, and the requirements to give proper notification, etc. Can I ask the  Minister about the current situation, which means that members of residents&rsquo;  groups can one day refuse to engage in dialogue, yet be rewarded by the current  Parades Commission, and, very soon after, openly participate in illegal  protests or events with no repercussions &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The subject of the question does not seem to be dissident  republicans; it is another issue. Are we coming to the point, Mr Anderson?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. I ask whether the Minister agrees that illegal  dissident parades and events must be brought under the same rule of law as  every other such event.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Justice: I am sure that Members, even  those who have just arrived in the House, will not be surprised to hear that I  believe in the rule of law, regardless of who may be seeking to disturb it, who  may be creating difficulties and who may be fomenting problems. That rule, as  far as I am concerned, is absolute. The detail of managing parading and protests  is subject to potential legislation that is being promoted by OFMDFM.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Will the Minister of Justice give his comprehensive assessment of the recent  Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC) report, especially in the light of the  ongoing and as yet unchecked dissident campaign?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: By the recent IMC report, I take it that the Member is referring  to the specific report on the murder by UVF members of Bobby Moffett on the Shankill Road.  There is no doubt that there is a link with dissident activity on both sides of  the divide. Similarly, there is absolutely no doubt that it is important that  we in the institution representing the people of this region, the population of  Northern Ireland, and all the institutions of the state need to co-operate in  building the kind of society that will show the dissidents that progress is  being made. We must ensure that we continue to make the progress that has been  made in this place since 1998 and that we can move forward together. How those  matters are handled is an issue not just for the police, but for the whole of  society to work towards together.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s earlier reply that set out the number of meetings that  he has had on loyalist and so-called republican activity. I am conscious that  he said that one of the motives is to create division between the police and  the community. In the course of his meetings with the police, has he assured  them of the support that they have across this Chamber in the challenge that they  face? Will he also ask them to ensure that they do not add unnecessarily to any  of the disruption that is orchestrated and engineered by those people?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I welcome that statement of support for the police and the work  that they are doing, which I know is on behalf of us all. When I visit police  in different parts of Northern Ireland, it is always a pleasure to see that  work is being done on what I call community policing &mdash; what the Chief Constable  calls personal policing &mdash; despite the threats that many officers are under.  Engagement is happening in areas that would have been perceived as difficult  for the police to operate in during recent years. That is a very positive sign  of good work being done by the Police Service. It is absolutely clear that the  PSNI understands its role in helping to move this society forward. The question  is whether all elements of society are prepared to work with the police.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">UK Border Agency: Stranraer</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. Mr Hamilton asked the Minister of Justice what  discussions he has had with his counterpart in the Scottish Government  regarding the possible impact on illegal immigration and smuggling as a result  of the withdrawal of funding by the UK Border Agency for three police officers  based at the Port   of Stranraer. (AQO  106/11<a name="AQO106/11" id="AQO106/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Justice: Although I have not yet had a  discussion with Kenny MacAskill, the Scottish Cabinet Secretary, on that  matter, I discussed it with the UK Border Agency (UKBA) at the most recent  meeting of the Organised Crime Task Force last week. It explained that the  removal of three police officers who were seconded to UKBA is part of the  agency&rsquo;s longer term strategy to transfer investigative skills from police  officers to the UKBA staff, to become less reliant on them, and to be able to  work in partnership with other law enforcement agencies. The three officers at  Stranraer were dealing with immigration offenders and related criminality.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The identification of immigration crime using the Galloway  ports will move to Northern    Ireland using UK Border Agency staff. That  will replicate the work that they already do at the airports in this region. I  am assured that the change will not adversely affect the oversight that is  given to immigration matters between Scotland  and Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his reply. I am sure that the House is assured that  there is still work that concentrates on Northern Ireland. However, does he  share my concerns, which were outlined by his party colleague Anna Lo in the  human trafficking debate when she highlighted that people were being trafficked  through Stranraer and criminals were being caught there, that while we watch  the front door here in Northern Ireland,  the back door in Scotland  is being left wide open?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Justice: It is clear from Mr Hamilton&rsquo;s  question and the concerns about trafficking that have been expressed recently,  including in the discussions on my statement last week on North/South  co-operation, that this is a serious issue. The seconded police officers are  part of UK Border Agency capacity to investigate organised crime, including  trafficking. However, the fact that the strategy is transferring to the police  services in Scotland  and here will not counter that. It will, perhaps, allow for greater integration  between the police services and other agencies, which will help them to  recognise the work that needs to be done on that basis. Operation Apsis, which  is the most recent work that was done, was conducted entirely by police  services across the UK.  It was led by the PSNI without direct involvement from the Border Agency.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr A Maginness: I thank the Minister for his answer.  Wider issues of human trafficking between the UK  and Ireland  and between North and South are involved. Has the Minister made any contact  with his counterpart in the South to discuss bringing about measures that could  effectively curb human trafficking between North and South and with Europe?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Justice: As I said last week in  response to a number of questions, the issue of human trafficking was not a key  feature of the agenda of the IGA meeting that I had with Dermot Ahern in the  early part of the summer. It is, however, an issue that is dealt with by a  working group of the Serious Organised Crime Agency. There is full participation  on a cross-border basis in recognition of the role that the garda&iacute; and other  agencies in the South have to carry out. That shows co-operation at the highest  operational level, where it is needed most. That is a sign that the agencies on  both sides of the border take trafficking seriously. It is absolutely clear  from the mood of Members in every part of the House that it is something that I  will need to keep re-emphasising.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Kinahan: I thank the Minister because he has  answered my question already. Perhaps he will answer another: are there any  more changes in funding that may affect the borders and how we tackle organised  crime and people trafficking?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Justice: I would be extremely unwise to  suggest that there will be no changes in funding. I simply assure the Member  that, at this point, there are no proposed changes in funding that would affect  the fight against trafficking. I will certainly do my best to ensure that,  given the priority that the House has given the issue, it continues to be  regarded as a priority in financial terms.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">McDermott Case: Supervision and Treatment  Order</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  Gallagher </strong>asked the Minister of Justice when it became known that an  incorrect special treatment order was issued for the McDermott brothers, how  long it took to correct the error and reissue the order and what steps are  being taken to investigate the circumstances of the error. (AQO 107/11<a name="AQO107/11" id="AQO107/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: The Department of Justice knew on 17 August 2010 that there was a  discrepancy between the supervision and treatment orders (STOs) that were  issued in respect of the two McDermott brothers and the judgement of the court.  The Department of Justice notified the Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunals  Service on 18 August. Following consultation with the Office of the Lord Chief  Justice and the trial judge, amended orders were issued on 20 August. On 3  September, I advised the Chairperson of the Committee for Justice that the  Courts and Tribunals Service had initiated a review of all current supervision  and treatment orders, including those in the McDermott case. That review has  now been completed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I advised Members earlier today, I have since written to  the Chairperson of the Committee for Justice to advise that, in view of the  issues that were raised by the review of STOs, I instructed the Courts and  Tribunals Service to undertake a detailed examination of all its administrative  processes in the case of the McDermott brothers. I have also asked the service  to undertake an urgent review of all sexual offences prevention orders that  have been issued in Northern    Ireland to ensure that they accurately  reflect the decision of the judge in individual cases. I expect the review  report by mid-October.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To ensure that such errors do not recur, I have instructed  the director of the Courts and Tribunals Service to initiate an urgent review  of procedures for the preparation, checking and issuing of court orders in the  Crown Court to identify how those arrangements can be strengthened.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Pending the outcome of that review, court staff will be  retrained, and more robust monitoring procedures will be implemented. In  addition, more complex or novel orders will be referred to the trial judge for  confirmation before being issued, as agreed with the Lord Chief Justice. I have  also requested Dr Michael Maguire, the Chief Inspector of Criminal Justice in Northern Ireland,  to carry out a detailed investigation of how sexual offence cases are dealt  with by the justice system.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer and welcome some of the steps that he has  taken on the additional role of the judiciary. He said that there was an error  in the supervision and treatment order. There were mistakes in the SOPO and to  the notification of the brothers. Does he agree that all of those amount to a  failure to apply the law? Therefore, if we leave everything at that point, does  he understand the anguish that that caused? I notice that he has apologised,  but does he realise the worry that those mistakes caused, not only in Fermanagh  but everywhere, for people who support the law and want it to be upheld?  Therefore, will he take this opportunity to reassure the House that there will  be a thorough examination that will not stop at the judiciary but will involve  all staff in the justice system to ensure that they never again fail to apply  the law?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank Mr Gallagher for his supplementary question. He said that  there was a failure to implement the law. He is right on one level but  inaccurate on another. In the McDermott case, the law was upheld in that the  court&rsquo;s judgement was carried through. He is correct to state that there were  administrative errors in the Courts and Tribunals Service that led to some  confusion and certainly added to the suffering of victims and survivors in this  case and, perhaps, in others as well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the measures that I outlined and explained to  Members in full detail earlier &mdash; a copy of which is in the Assembly Library &mdash;  will fully reassure Members that the issue is taken as seriously as it could be  in the Department of Justice. The fact that we have not only the internal  investigations in the Courts and Tribunals Service and the work being done, for  example, to improve staff training and procedures but also the external,  detailed examination by the Chief Inspector of Criminal Justice indicates to  the House that I take the matter seriously and will ensure that those problems  do not recur.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Minister for all of that; however, a key issue in all this is the  victims. Will the Minister indicate how the protocol works to keep victims  informed of the situation? Does he plan any additional measures to keep victims  informed of the process and how it is progressing?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Mr Elliott raises a significant point that I covered earlier. As a  matter of practice, the Courts and Tribunals Service does not issue copies of  court orders to victims. However, on this occasion, records were shared with  the Public Prosecution Service, the PSNI and the various bodies directly  involved in the case. Earlier this year, joint working produced a victim and  witness handbook, which I launched shortly after taking up office, with the aim  of providing victims with clear information on the services that they can expect.  The Department&rsquo;s intention is to ensure that victims are provided with proper  services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The way in which staff in the Department of Justice ensured  that survivors of the McDermott case were kept informed yesterday, in advance  of public representatives, indicates that we have done what we can to alleviate  their concerns about the way in which this information has come out. However, I  recognise that very little can be done to prevent some measure of hurt.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  In a recent answer to a question that I submitted for written answer, the  Minister of Justice confirmed that the requirement for an approved address or  approval for an address can be removed if circumstances change.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that circumstances in Donagh  clearly changed when the brothers returned, and the understandable community  concern was raised that that was a justifiable reason for approval to be  removed for that address?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I appreciate the Member&rsquo;s question, but he is removing me from the  responsibilities of the justice system in order to ensure that the judgement  was carried through to the issue of how it is managed by those responsible for  the management of the supervision and treatment order. That does not relate  directly to the justice system, and it is not something about which I can give  him a specific answer.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: We  accept that there is confusion among the public about this case. As a result of  that confusion, victims and survivors want to ensure that they are protected  against any future recidivism to paedophile activity. When will the Minister be  able to give the House clear direction that those procedures are in place, so  that the public can be satisfied that they are being adequately protected?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Justice: As I said in my statement,  urgent work is under way, and I expect the Courts and Tribunals Service&rsquo;s  report on the checking of sexual offences prevention orders to be completed by  the middle of October. In addition, I have requested that Dr Maguire, the chief  inspector of criminal justice, give me his interim report into his external  examination of procedures by the end of October. I shall ensure that the  Justice Committee is made fully aware of the contents of those reports at the  earliest possible opportunity, and any recommendations will be put in place as  fast as can be.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading"><strong>Maghaberry  Prison</strong>: Remand Prisoners</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. Mrs D Kelly asked the Minister of Justice how  many prisoners in Maghaberry prison are currently on remand awaiting trial and  what percentage this represents of the total number of prisoners. (AQO 108/11<a name="AQO108/11" id="AQO108/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: There are currently 471 prisoners on remand in Maghaberry,  including those on remand and those awaiting trial. That equates to 58&middot;2% of  the total prison population in Maghaberry. Given that the courts do not sit  over the summer, the figure is seasonally elevated. The pre-summer percentage  remand figure for Maghaberry was 48&middot;2%. It is difficult to show the length of  time that an individual prisoner spends on remand; however, in the past 12  months, the overall average was 34&middot;6 days. Of course, the figure can vary  significantly between individuals. The problem is not new. As we all know, it  well pre-dates devolution. Speeding up criminal justice remains a key priority  for me, and a refreshed programme of work to tackle avoidable delay is being taken  forward by the criminal justice board.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs D Kelly: Those are shocking figures. Will the  Minister outline exactly how he will take forward work to improve those  statistics? Given that more than 50% of prisoners are on remand and,  presumably, have not yet been found guilty, does he agree that it is a  significant management issue for the prison board?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Justice: Mrs Kelly is absolutely right;  it clearly is a significant issue. As I highlighted, at the end of the summer  holidays, the average is at its annual high    point. If the courts were to sit more during the  summer &mdash; perhaps it is not appropriate to suggest that in the Assembly &mdash; that  might keep the average down. Nevertheless, delays in the system are clearly a  huge issue, and, since taking office, I have highlighted the fact that it needs  to be addressed. At the moment, a refreshed programme of work on speeding up  justice, which will cut across the criminal justice programme, is being taken  forward by the criminal justice board and should provoke a positive impact on  the effectiveness and expediency of all aspects of the system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are four specific work strands, which I should  explain. First, in case preparation, the focus is on reducing bureaucracy and  improving timelines, especially on procedures involving the police/PPS  interface. Secondly, in case management, better ways will be developed to  improve the conduct of criminal cases through the courts process. Thirdly, a  specific effort will be made to identify and look at how to tackle the causes  of delay in youth cases, because we are particularly keen to deal with the  acute problem of young people who have to wait too long in the system.  Fourthly, a strand will deal with government&rsquo;s accountability for overseeing  the overall programme and will ensure that the criminal justice delivery group  functions as it should.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Campbell: The number of people convicted and on  remand is reaching an all-time high. With that in mind, in the next 12 months,  will the Minister be able to report significant progress on the construction of  the new jail at Magilligan?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I should, perhaps, suggest to the Member that when he smiles and  asks that question, he should look to see whether the Minister of Finance and  Personnel is in the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, there are serious issues with delays that need to  be addressed. This society must also address how we treat custodial sentences,  as opposed to the alternatives, so that we ensure the best possible public  protection outcomes. The Member should also bear in mind that, although numbers  are at a high at the moment, I do not think that they are at an all-time high.  The numbers of people in prison in Northern Ireland are significantly  lower than those in all three other jurisdictions in these islands. Therefore,  the Member must look at the overall picture rather than at the short-term  trend.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister take into  account the CJI report on avoidable delay? What targets has he set himself for  processing cases so that they are dealt with quickly? How will he ensure that  people spend less time on remand and that legal cases are not drawn out, with  the result that the stress that that causes is lessened?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Mr Leonard asked about targets that I have set myself. It is not  as much about that as about ensuring that there is a joined-up process. It is  easy, at times, for different elements of the criminal justice system to look  merely at their own timeliness. It seems to me that the only timeline that  concerns the great majority of the population is that between an offence being  committed and the offender being dealt with in court. It does not really matter  whether delays occur at any one of three or four intermediate stages. Through  the work of the Criminal Justice Board, we must ensure that we get joined-up  working, that we deal with excessive bureaucracy, that we ensure that  procedures work in a timely way, and that justice is not only done but is seen  to be done and done swiftly.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Department of Justice: Ministerial  Meetings</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr  Neeson </strong>asked the Minister of Justice to outline the issues discussed at his  recent meetings with the Home Secretary and the Justice Secretary. (AQO 109/11<a name="AQO109/11" id="AQO109/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I held separate meetings with the Home Secretary and the Justice  Secretary in London  on 8 September 2010. In the discussion with Theresa May, we considered her  future legislative plans in areas that have a read-across for Northern Ireland.  Those areas include DNA retention and the vetting and barring scheme; her  proposals for reviewing police terms and conditions and creating the so-called  national crime agency; the current situation in Northern Ireland; and the  importance of securing an adequate funding settlement for policing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my discussion with Ken Clarke, we addressed issues to do  with the judiciary in Northern    Ireland; UK-wide tribunals; European  matters; public spending; and my proposals for legal aid and publicly funded  legal services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In both cases, the meetings provided an important  opportunity to ensure that Whitehall Ministers recognised the impact that new  policy proposals could have on Northern    Ireland. They also provided an opportunity  to build a relationship in which the devolution settlement is recognised but  where arrangements for good co-operation across jurisdictions are put in place.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Can the Minister assure the House that the Home Secretary and the Justice  Secretary are fully aware of the particular pressures that the Department of  Justice in Northern Ireland  faces, given the threat of terrorism and the policing of parades? Will they  take account of those and other local factors when considering UK-wide  initiatives and budgets?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: It might be said that, in recent years, Whitehall Departments have  not always entirely appreciated Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s particular circumstances. Both  Cabinet Ministers whom I met listened to what my accompanying officials and I  said to them. Indeed, my officials gave detailed work to their counterparts. There  is no doubt that, following the meeting, both Cabinet Ministers were fully  aware that there are real issues in Northern   Ireland that do not apply, particularly for the Home  Secretary, to other police services across the UK. It is vital that this Assembly  recognises that, whatever general budgetary cuts we face, we must provide an  adequate budget for the particular aspects of policing that need to be treated  differently to policing as it is seen by police services in other parts of the UK.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Spratt: Did the Minister have any discussions about  the national security budget? Other police services throughout the United Kingdom  have access to that budget, but the PSNI does not. The dissident threat affects  the whole of the United    Kingdom. If he did not discuss the national  security budget with the Home Secretary or the Justice Secretary, and given the  dissident threat, will he discuss that budget so that it can be sorted out in  favour of the PSNI?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: The national security budget did not particularly feature in my  discussions with the Home Secretary. However, since that meeting, I have  discussed the issue with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and he  has discussed it with the Home Secretary and the Treasury. Therefore, the point  is being well made, although it was not a particular focus of the London  meeting.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><strong>Debate resumed  on amendment to motion</strong>:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly condemns human trafficking; notes  with grave concern the growing prevalence of human trafficking for the sex  trade, domestic servitude and labour exploitation in Northern Ireland; further  notes that men, women and children are victims of human trafficking and that  human trafficking exists because of local demand; and calls on the Minister of  Justice and the Executive to raise awareness of human trafficking among the  public in order to assist the authorities in securing prosecutions against  those who carry out this modern form of slavery and to ensure that Northern  Ireland is a hostile place for traffickers. &mdash; [Mr McNarry.]</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><strong>Which  amendment was</strong>:</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At end insert</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;; and further calls on the Minister of Justice to  work closely with the Irish Government and the European Union to ensure that  Northern Ireland is part of an all-island, European-wide response to this  serious issue.&rdquo; &mdash; [Mr A Maginness.]</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice (Mr Ford)</strong>: I welcome the opportunity to contribute to today&rsquo;s  debate on human trafficking, and I am grateful to the Members who brought the  matter to our attention. I support the motion and want to put on record that  human trafficking is one of the vilest and most wicked crimes imaginable. The  degree of brutality, misery and suffering involved is difficult to grasp.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry made a number of serious points, and, although I  missed the first 20 seconds of his speech, he has missed the first 40 seconds  of mine. He made a number of points that we will look at in detail. If I do not  respond to every point that was made during the debate, I will certainly ensure  that Members are written to. I also state my support for the amendment. Not all  amendments in this place are necessarily helpful, but this amendment usefully  complements the original motion. I am happy to accept the motion and the  amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It will be helpful to explain what human trafficking is and  what it is not. Human trafficking is the coercion, often using extreme violence  or the threat of violence, of men, women and children into activities in which  they would not choose to participate. It involves work for little or no  financial gain, the loss of liberty and the lack of the basic right of an  individual to choose the course of his or her life. In simple terms, it is  slavery, a rather nasty form of slavery that is sometimes described as modern  slavery. That point was made most particularly by Mr Sydney Anderson in his  maiden speech and was echoed in different parts of the Chamber at different  times.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Human trafficking may happen for a number of purposes, most  usually for sexual exploitation, labour exploitation or domestic servitude.  Examples of all those forms have been discovered in Northern Ireland.  Trafficking for the purposes of organ donation is also a reality but has not, I  am glad to say, been evidenced so far in Northern Ireland. Although it is  absolutely clear that trafficking for sexual exploitation is the  highest-profile form of trafficking here, it is not the sole form, and we  should not focus simply on that aspect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Trafficking may involve transporting victims across the  globe. Again, that has been the case with some victims who have been recovered  in Northern Ireland. However, it need not be, and victims can be and are  trafficked within their own jurisdiction. Internal trafficking, as it is known,  has happened in Northern Ireland, most recently as discovered by Operation  Apsis, which we will discuss later. People smuggling, although still illegal,  is not trafficking. The difference is that, with people smuggling, the people  involved are consenting, as they have willingly paid a smuggler to bring them  into another country to live as illegal immigrants somewhere where they have no  right to live or work. However, that is not the same as trafficking, to which  no consent is given. In some cases, people who have consented to being smuggled  have, on arrival, been trafficked.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to make it clear that those who have been  trafficked for sexual exploitation are not prostitutes in the normal sense of  the word. Although they may appear to be part of the same industry, they are  absolutely not prostitutes. They are exploited victims who have been forced to  take part in something that is not their choice. Furthermore, although  trafficking victims may be forced to take part in illegal activities, they are  not and should not be treated as criminals. They have been forced into  illegality, and we must recognise that and treat them as the victims that,  sadly, they are.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Anna Lo raised specific concerns about the treatment of  children. That issue merits attention. Human trafficking, as we have all said,  is human slavery &mdash; nothing more and nothing less. It is becoming a well-used  phrase, but only because it is true. Part of the result of that slavery was  highlighted by Jonathan Bell&rsquo;s contribution, when he raised the issue of self-harm  and mentioned how that sometimes goes as far as suicide among the victims of  trafficking.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion focuses on the need for greater awareness and  calls on me and my Executive colleagues to raise awareness among the public to  assist in securing prosecutions. I agree that greater awareness is required,  and I want to mention what has been done so far and tell the House about the  Department&rsquo;s future plans.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We can debate when the issue of human trafficking came to  our attention, but it is fair to say that, even five years ago, there was  little hard evidence of it. Even two or three years ago, there was, perhaps,  little evidence, as was cited by Alex Maskey in reference to the discussions on  the Policing Board. That has most certainly changed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members, initially Lord Morrow, talked about  trafficking for sexual exploitation, even in country towns across Northern  Ireland. Tom Elliott said that those who had previously smuggled drugs now  smuggled people, and, clearly, there are major links to organised crime, which  we are seeking to address on a broad front.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last year, 25 potential victims of human trafficking were  recovered in Northern Ireland. So far this year, seven have been recovered.  Police advice and other evidence now suggests that this is a growing problem  that includes an organised global network, not just in these islands and Europe  but literally global. Trafficking is clearly a feature worldwide, into and out  of a number of different countries. When Alban Maginness referred to Northern  Ireland potentially being a staging post, he was right in many senses, although  Northern Ireland is also, in some cases, a terminus. However, there is no doubt  that Northern Ireland is a staging post between Scotland and the Republic and,  sometimes, places wider afield.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Blue Blindfold campaign is the national campaign to  raise awareness for which the motion asks. It was launched in Northern Ireland  in February 2010 by means of advertisements on buses across Northern Ireland,  Internet advertising and posters and leaflets that were sent to health centres  and GP surgeries and distributed recently through the community safety  partnership network. I urge Members who have not done so to look at the Blue  Blindfold website, which gives a valuable insight into the problem, including  the views of victims.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department also hosted an awareness seminar, when front  line staff from health and social services, education, law enforcement and  legal, religious and voluntary and community organisations received  presentations from keynote speakers to raise awareness of human trafficking,  including, most particularly, the needs of victims. We have also developed a  multilingual leaflet and poster that are aimed at the victims and point them  towards the help that is available. That information will soon be displayed at  ports of entry to Northern Ireland, main railway stations and other venues  where victims may be contacted, such as GP surgeries.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, one of the tragedies around trafficking is that,  even if we put posters at ports and airports, some of those who arrive will not  realise that they are victims of trafficking as they pass the posters. There is  a real issue of needing to ensure that people are given the opportunity to follow  those points up. Therefore, I am pleased to announce that I plan to reinforce  the initial Blue Blindfold campaign by running a second and larger wave of  advertising to raise awareness among the general public of the existence of  human trafficking and what they can do to help. I also want to undertake some  evaluation of our efforts so far to raise awareness to help us target our  resources most effectively. The aim is indeed, as the motion says, to make  Northern Ireland a hostile place for the traffickers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mark Durkan highlighted his concerns that immigration laws  may help to create a culture of fear among victims. Victims of trafficking may  fear that, because of strict immigration laws across the UK, they may end up  being treated as criminals when they are, in fact, the victims of trafficking.  There is no doubt that we need to ensure that agencies work in a way that  detracts from that erroneous thought, and we need a united community effort to  assist in that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate the PSNI on its work against the traffickers.  The recent Operation Apsis, which a number of Members have referred to, was led  by the PSNI. It involved searches in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales and  saw the recovery of 15 potential victims in different parts of the UK and the  arrest of four traffickers, who have since been charged in Belfast. That is a  sign that the PSNI takes the issue seriously, and there is no question of  resources restricting that. However, it is clear that public concern needs to  be carried forward into public action to support the police in taking action  against traffickers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to put on record the first-class support that  is available for victims from Women&rsquo;s Aid and from the Migrant Helpline, who  are contracted by my Department to provide victim-centred support to victims of  human trafficking who are <strong>recovered  here. I will correct Mr McNarry&rsquo;s point slightly</strong>: those agencies do not do  that on their own. Those voluntary groups work with the full support of the  Department in supporting the victims of trafficking.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also need more police operations to rescue victims and  prosecute traffickers. However, it is a clandestine crime, and the police need  the support of the public. The key action that members of the public can take  is to report suspicions to the police. The second action is to cut off the  demand for human trafficking. In particular, men who use brothels must be made  aware of the possibility that they are funding the trade in human trafficking  and that, if they have sex with someone who, they suspect, is working under  duress, they may be charged and prosecuted under new legislation. Anna Lo said  earlier that that should be the case. I am happy to tell her that the Policing  and Crime Act 2009 was brought into operation and formally commenced earlier this  year. It is now the position across the UK that anyone who engages in sex with  someone who, they suspect, is a victim of trafficking is committing a criminal  offence. It is as simple and as bald as that. It is the demand for brothels and  sexual services that is leading to the increase in human trafficking for sexual  exploitation and all the misery and brutality that go with it. Men, in  particular, must become more aware of the effects that their actions have on  others. The public also need to become vigilant about the possibility of  trafficking for the exploitation of labour and domestic servitude. I urge the  public to be vigilant and to report any suspicions to the police.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Make no mistake: we are not talking about brothels in seedy  back rooms in insalubrious parts of town. We are talking, sometimes, about  brothels in modern apartment blocks and good areas of town that have been  rented for a short time to accommodate trafficking victims who are moved around  the country, these islands and Europe at the whim of their pimps and  traffickers. Therefore, landlords should become aware and be suspicious if, for  example, they are offered cash for short-term rent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Trafficking is undoubtedly making vast sums of money for  criminal gangs. I want those gangs to be prosecuted and to see their criminal  assets recovered. There is also no doubt that the Organised Crime Task Force is  taking the matter seriously. As I mentioned during Question Time a few minutes  ago, a subgroup ensures full co-operation between the different agencies in an  attempt to deal with and combat trafficking. It is not about having  co-operation protocols; it is about having real, direct and serious  co-operation between the different agencies. As I said earlier, that extends to  cross-border co-operation. Members will be aware of the ongoing Operation  Apsis. I understand that Strathclyde Police believe that the gang involved in  Operation Apsis could have generated &pound;20,000 of income a day. Strathclyde  Police are seeking <strong>to have &pound;2&middot;3 million  of criminal assets frozen, which is a measure of the scale of this crime</strong>:  &pound;2 million worth of human misery. That is why we must treat the issue seriously  and ensure that full action is taken.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Awareness of the problem is the key. I am committed to  doing more in the coming months to harness the support of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  general public and to work in partnership with others in the South and Great  Britain. The amendment outlines the need to work closely with parties across  these islands and Europe. There are excellent working relationships between law  enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, both at overall and  operational level. That point was raised by Martina Anderson. As I said,  members of law enforcement agencies in the Republic are recognised on the  Organised Crime Task Force subgroup concerning human trafficking and  immigration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that this is a real issue, as today&rsquo;s debate and the  questions asked last week and earlier today at Question Time demonstrate. I  will ensure that the meeting on the intergovernmental agreement shows that the  issue is taken seriously across both jurisdictions. There is also good  co-operation within the UK, as shown by Operation Apsis, which was led by the  PSNI and involved cross-border working. Other operations also involved cross-border  co-operation. We are compliant with existing Council of Europe conventions. We  will comply with any future EU directives on human trafficking and ensure that  we are not seen to be lagging behind in any sense. Anna Lo&rsquo;s reference to a  Chinese woman with an address in Drogheda being picked up in Stranraer shows  that we should not be anything but fully alert to what is happening.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Human trafficking is a foul crime, possibly second only to  murder. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I also welcome  the House&rsquo;s unanimity, at least in respect of the motion, if not the amendment.  Members have referred to an increase in trafficking, and the police and other  agencies are taking serious action on that. My Department and its agencies will  do all that can be done to combat this crime. We ask for the support of the  general public in that process.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  A good place to start is to welcome Minister Ford&rsquo;s clarification that the  Policing and Crime Act 2009 is now in place across the United Kingdom, making  it illegal to procure the services of a prostitute who has been trafficked. We  all welcome that, and that theme emerged across the House during the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I prepared for the debate, it struck me that more women  were trafficked in the 1980s from Asia than during the entire 400 years of  slavery from Africa. That puts the scale of the human trafficking crisis into a  modern context.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I join colleagues in welcoming Mr Anderson to the House. In  his maiden speech he, along with many of his DUP colleagues, invoked William  Wilberforce, who campaigned long and hard. I believe that it took him 40 years  to collect 15 million signatures. My figures could be wrong, but that is  something like the scale of time and the amount of support that he ended up  with in his campaign to abolish slavery in the then United Kingdom. We could do  the same today in two days. We could collect 50 million indications of support  through social media, and they would come from across the world. It is  interesting that in the same way as the scale of slavery has increased  exponentially into a new modern slavery &mdash; human trafficking &mdash; our capacity to  fight it and to raise awareness about it has increased exponentially. That  theme was reflected in Lord Morrow and Mr Bell&rsquo;s contributions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP Benches welcome the support for the amendment. To  pick up on some of the points raised by colleagues on the other side of the  House, we do not see the amendment as being exclusivist in any way; it does not  seek to deny the United Kingdom Government&rsquo;s involvement. I argue that it  concedes it. The only way that we could develop a European Union dimension to a  regional response to human trafficking would be through the member state of  which we are a member. I call on the Minister to play as active a role as  possible as a regional Minister in the workings of the European Council. It is  through the aegis of the United Kingdom representation in Brussels that the  opinions of this part of Ireland can be made strong and we can seek consensus  among other regions and other member states on how to tackle the problem,  which, ironically, although a borderless issue, requires borders to survive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP recognises the renewed investment in the Blue  Blindfold campaign, as we all acknowledge that it makes a positive contribution  to raising awareness of this terrible issue. However, there is an important  point of policy that we should coalesce around in the House: the United Kingdom  Government continued to opt out of the European Union directive on human  trafficking. I would like us, through today&rsquo;s debate, to send a powerful signal  to the United Kingdom Government to opt into that directive, as do Governments  of other member states across the European Union and, indeed, the Southern  Government. It is by opting into that directive and becoming part of a European  framework that we can tackle the issue seriously. Whether we are a transit port  or a destination, trafficking does not stop either in our region, on this  island or even in these islands. The European Union is probably the best unit  of government through which to address the crisis of human trafficking.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the brief time available to me, I thank colleagues in  Sinn F&eacute;in, the Alliance Party and the Ulster Unionist Party for their support  for the amendment; it is much appreciated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford rightly made the distinction between smuggled  people and trafficked people. Among us we have a community of people who, in my  opinion, are arriving because they are smuggled, and they are the Roma  community. It is important for us to reflect on today&rsquo;s debate and on whether  it applies to some of the circumstances that surround that new community among  us.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: The Member should draw his remarks  to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McDevitt: Through today&rsquo;s debate, the Assembly and  the Executive should resolve, in a concerted way, to understand the needs of  that community. It is statusless, and its members have been smuggled and  potentially trafficked.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Kinahan: I thank the Minister and all Members who  took part in today&rsquo;s debate. I support the motion tabled by my party and the  amendment. As many Members said, human trafficking is a transnational problem,  and the amendment suggests a practical way to work with our neighbours. It is a  point well made, and, on an issue as serious as this, we should take it on  board and accept the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls on the Minister of Justice and the  Executive to make Northern Ireland:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a hostile place for human traffickers.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I hope that all Members, through their actions,  will help to make it so. The motion also asks us to raise awareness of human  trafficking, which is repugnant, despicable, inhuman, abhorrent, and there are  many other words that describe how ghastly and unacceptable it is. We must  confront what appears to be local demand for trafficked people. We have heard  that adults and children are victims and that trafficking is no longer  gender-specific. I hope that the Minister of Justice will commit to keeping the  Executive and the Assembly abreast of the measures that he hopes to introduce  to tackle the rising incidence of this type of crime and to secure  prosecutions; I am sure that he will. The situation is complex because of the  acute vulnerability of the victims.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party tabled the motion with the  intention of raising awareness of the serious issue of human trafficking. The  party intends to work with its colleagues in the House to ensure that it is a  top priority for the Assembly and the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate has clarified the fact that human trafficking is  modern-day slavery. Slavery was abolished in 1834, although it is sad to note  that it was abolished in Niger only in 2003.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will digress slightly. I am sure that many Members have  watched films such as &lsquo;Slumdog Millionaire&rsquo; and &lsquo;Taken&rsquo; and enjoyed the  entertainment. However, today Members will realise that we are close to seeing  the ghastly stories behind those films here in Northern Ireland. Men, women and  children are being brought into the country illegally, and some vulnerable  victims, particularly children, are trafficked internally within the United  Kingdom. They are then coerced into servitude in its many forms: in the home,  in the workplace and in brothels.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In today&rsquo;s newspapers, we read details of Operation Apsis  and learned about the phenomenal sums of money involved in buying and selling  human beings. Gangs earned &pound;20,000 each day and amassed over &pound;2 million in  assets, which is utterly deplorable and has no place in a civilised country. We  should also consider how the law deals with landlords who know what is going on  in their accommodation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank all Members who took part in the debate. Many  points were made, and I will not be able to touch on all of them in the time  that I have left.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like many Members, Alban Maginness highlighted the European  dimension and told the House that we must implement the European Union  directive on human trafficking. Martina Anderson told the House that  discoveries that were made during the recent raids represented just the tip of  the iceberg, and, although I hope that it is a small iceberg underneath, I know  what she means. She also made the point that the debate will make everyone more  aware of the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that all Members congratulate Anna Lo for all her  work, particularly on this issue. In her contribution, she mentioned that 1,000  people from 51 nationalities have been brought here to become prostitutes, and  527 potential victims of trafficking from 61 nationalities were referred to the  National Referral Mechanism. She also raised the point about awareness. I would  also like to re-emphasise the point that she made about unaccompanied minors  who are coming into this country in increasing numbers, going to bed and  breakfasts and then disappearing. That is one issue that we must tackle.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank and congratulate Sydney Anderson on his maiden  speech. I, too, did that not long ago, and I know exactly how he feels. It was  a very good, compelling maiden speech, and one of his key points was that we  must all work together and congratulate the police.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I liked Billy Leonard&rsquo;s terminology of twenty-first century  slavery. That is an appalling idea for all of us, and it is something that  should have gone 200 years ago.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was intrigued by Lord Morrow, who criticised my party for  politicising the point and then did the very same thing, which, of course, I,  too, am now doing. Nevertheless, I take the point that trafficking is prevalent  in our towns and, as someone else said, in smaller areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Tom Elliott gave us some more figures. He told  us that 18 people were rescued, followed by a further 15. I hope that we rescue  many more people in time. He also made the point that there is no place for  trafficking in a civilised society, that we must highlight it and get it known  throughout the whole of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mark Durkan highlighted the immigration issue, which is  absolutely key to ensuring that in dealing with the matter through immigration  we do not add to the fear of the victims. Alex Maskey said that it was a  shocking trade and a scandal; we all join him in that view. He also said that  we must make the public more aware.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We thank the Minister for the many points that he put  forward. We welcome the fact that the Blue Blindfold website will continue and  that the Minister will look at how we can improve all the other ways of dealing  with the matter, particularly in evaluating all that has gone before. We join  with him in congratulating Women&rsquo;s Aid and the Migrant Helpline. At the  beginning, the Minister&rsquo;s definitions were absolutely key, because many of us  might not have been aware of them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, in making his winding-up speech on the amendment,  Conall McDevitt, and others, said that people arriving here are being smuggled  and then trafficked. If we have learnt anything today it is that we want to  make everybody aware of that, and we need everyone to help, because it is a  global problem.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will close by reiterating my praise for the work of the  police in combating human trafficking and dismantling crime gangs. Of  particular note is the excellent work of Women&rsquo;s Aid and the Migrant Helpline.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>I support the  motion, but I will finish in the same way as my colleague</strong>: those behind the  trafficking of people must be abhorred by society.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: Mr  Deputy Speaker, it is Mr Paul Givan.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, I am raising the issue of Lagan Valley Hospital  accident and emergency unit. The Minister will know that the issues pertaining  to that unit are reflected in the 2002 document &lsquo;Developing Better Services:  Modernising Hospitals and Reforming Structures&rsquo;. That document was launched by  the then direct rule Minister. Now that a devolved Minister is responsible for  that, I hope that the issue will be given serious consideration and that that  document will be fundamentally reviewed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I <strong>asked </strong>the  Minister whether he was going to review that document, and he replied that he  did not have any intention of carrying out a review at this time. However, in  light of his decision about maternity services at Lagan Valley Hospital &mdash; he  agreed to a midwifery-led unit despite that running contrary to the 2002  &lsquo;Developing Better Services&rsquo; document &mdash; I hold out some hope that he will make  the right decision when it comes to the accident and emergency facility.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to outline a number of reasons why I believe that  the current acute facility providing 24-hour access to the local community  should be retained. Members will know that Lisburn has the second largest  population outside Belfast. It has a growing population, and, according to a  regional development plan, its population is forecast to reach some 130,000  residents by 2015. Belfast, on the other hand, has a declining population. The  point needs to be made that local services should be provided in areas where  the local community is growing and thriving, where it is appropriate to do so  and where that meets the interests of those affected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not hold the view that every hospital in Northern  Ireland should cater for every service. Clearly, if someone is going for a hip  replacement or a type of surgery that can be planned, it makes sense for that  to be centralised and to take place where there is excellence in the provision  of such procedures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No service should be more localised in communities than  accident and emergency facilities. However, in light of reductions in, and  closures of, A&amp;E acute care in other hospitals, I am fearful that the Lagan  Valley Hospital accident and emergency unit could, very suddenly, be faced with  closure. I hope that that is not going to be the case.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The accident and emergency unit examines approximately  35,000 people a year and has, undoubtedly, saved <strong>countless lives. The question that should be answered is this</strong>: if  the 2002 document on developing better services is to be fulfilled, where is  the capacity to absorb the 30,000-plus individuals who have been going to the  A&amp;E facility at the Lagan Valley Hospital, given the demands and pressures  already on other accident and emergency facilities?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Back in 2002, the Eastern Health and Social Services Board  said that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the emergency medical system throughout the Eastern  area is under pressure on an all year round basis and we do not envisage a  situation where sufficient capacity and resource will be devoted to provision  of emergency medical services or alternatives in a way which would allow  capacity by the Lagan Valley to be removed.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Through my dealings with the trust and hearing the  pressures that it has highlighted to me, I know that that statement remains the  case in 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned that without the accident and emergency unit  residents in the Lisburn city area would have difficulty in accessing emergency  services within the designated 45 minutes, particularly those people living in  rural areas. The Lisburn area covers not just the urban population in the  central Lisburn city area but reaches as far as Dromara and the rural hinterlands  within the city boundaries. The Lagan Valley Hospital area goes further afield  to Dromore, and the accident and emergency unit caters for residents from as  far as Banbridge, Saintfield and Carryduff. Therefore, when looking at the  issue, we have to consider the wider geographical area and beyond, and we  cannot look at it just from the basis of the Lisburn city population.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The accident and emergency unit is vital to a number of key  stakeholders that depend on the facility being there and being accessible. For  example, around 3,000 businesses are registered in the city area; there is a  large rural farming community; there are more than 50 schools in the city area;  and we are home to the regional headquarters of the British Army at Thiepval  Barracks. It is important that those individuals and stakeholders have access  to the accident and emergency unit. Local, fast, safe and easily accessible  emergency services are paramount for children, teachers, students, farmers,  business people, the elderly, the disabled and the services&rsquo; organisations. The  facilities at the accident and emergency unit are vital to the local community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the time of the 2002 report, the then Down Lisburn Trust  said that it believed that the accident and emergency unit could continue. I  believe that it should continue to provide acute 24-hour provision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister needs to clarify his position on the review of  urgent care that is taking place. I asked him a question about <strong>the Lagan Valley Hospital accident and  emergency unit. In his response, on 8 July 2010, he said</strong>:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The delivery of services at Lagan Valley is a matter  for the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust as the service provider. The  Trust has advised that it is currently undertaking a consultation in respect of  urgent care services across the Trust area, including the Lagan Valley Hospital  Emergency Department.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister was clearly putting the onus and  responsibility for carrying out that work on the trust.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I then received a letter dated 23 April 2010. Members  should bear in mind that the Minister&rsquo;s response to my question was on 8 July  2010. The letter, dated 23 April 2010, which was from the Minister, signed in  his name, with his signature, and addressed &ldquo;To colleagues&rdquo;, concerned a  meeting that took place in February at the Clady Villa. The Minister was  thanking the people involved for taking the time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>I will not read out  the full letter but, in it, the Minister states</strong>:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I also recognise the potential for modernisation  within acute services, and would like to see early engagement to identify  opportunities for change.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, on 8 July, I received a response from the Minister  stating that it is a matter for the trust. My reading of the Minister&rsquo;s  internal letter to his colleagues in the professional services is that he has  asked them to bring forward changes for modernisation, particularly in acute  primary care. The Minister needs to clarify his role, who is carrying out the  review, and under whose instructions. Then we can provide assurances to the  community about where we stand.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Does the Member not find it somewhat unfair that the pressure appears  constantly to be on Lagan Valley Hospital, first with pressure on maternity  services, and now pressure on the accident and emergency service? Despite the  growing area that that hospital serves, services continue to diminish, while  there are two hospitals in Belfast, the Mater and the Royal Victoria, where  maternity and accident and emergency services are still provided, despite them  being only one mile from each other.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does he agree that the Minister is allowing the people of  Lagan Valley to be categorised as second-class citizens when it comes to health  care compared with Belfast citizens, and that the loud and clear message from  Lagan Valley about the consultation process is that the proposals are  unacceptable? Will the Member support me in making clear to the Minister that  such proposals are unacceptable to that community?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  The Member made important points, and I agree with him. At meetings that I  held, and at public meetings that I attended, the point was made that Lisburn  people believe that they are being treated as second-class citizens compared  with Belfast, where, as I said, there is a declining population. There are big  and difficult decisions to be taken about the services that are provided for  that city. However, it is not fair that the people of Lisburn should be  penalised because of the declining population in the Belfast area. When it  comes to the accident and emergency facility, we, as public representatives,  will champion the people&rsquo;s voices. We do not find it acceptable that we should  be stripped of acute care at Lagan Valley Hospital.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has a responsibility to ensure that staff  levels are adequately catered for, because we have seen other facilities  suddenly having to close for clinical reasons because of safety concerns. We  cannot allow key medical staff to be removed or not replaced, or allow a lack  of active engagement by the Department. We must ensure that people are  recruited to carry out the required work and provide the necessary clinical  expertise and coverage so that we do not have a scenario in which Lagan Valley  Hospital is deprived of its services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We will fight for Lagan Valley Hospital to retain its  current services. The Minister is part of a devolved Administration, but the  document was produced under direct rule. He needs to ensure that the people of  Lisburn are treated fairly, and that their interests are put first in all  considerations.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank my fellow MLA from Lagan  Valley Paul Givan &mdash; I know his name, being a member of Lisburn council &mdash; for  bringing this issue before the Assembly. I broadly welcome what he said. I  agree that, considering the growing population in Lisburn over the years, and  the catchment area for Lagan Valley Hospital, no accident and emergency  facility should be downgraded.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We saw the furore about the Mid-Ulster Hospital, and what  happened there. I hope that the Minister will take on board what the elected  representatives from Lagan Valley and Lisburn are saying about this issue, and  look at the matter again. I know that he will tell us about cuts to his budget,  but there is a strong case for Lisburn retaining its accident and emergency  services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have had debates in the Chamber about maternity  services, and progress will hopefully be made on the establishment of the new  midwife-led unit. Those of us who, over the years, have been elected either to  this House or to Lisburn City Council have been concerned about the future of  Lagan Valley Hospital for some time. Over the years, there have even been  concerns over whether its future as a hospital would be safeguarded.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Removing any services, particularly accident and emergency  services, would be unhelpful. I support Paul Givan&rsquo;s call to retain a full  accident and emergency service at Lagan Valley. I hope that the Minister takes  on board what we are saying today.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: I  am glad of the opportunity to speak in the Adjournment debate, and I thank Paul  Givan for securing it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not a member of the Lagan Valley constituency.  However, downgrading the accident and emergency unit at the Lagan Valley  hospital would affect my South Antrim constituency, because people from the  Glenavy area may use the accident and emergency unit at Antrim Area Hospital.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Glenavy people always considered themselves to be part  of Lagan Valley and would have used the Lagan Valley Hospital and its accident  and emergency unit. If that unit is downgraded and an ambulance is picking  people up in Glenavy, where will it bring them? Will it bring them to Antrim  Area Hospital, which is probably closest, or to a Belfast hospital?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that such operational decisions are matters  for the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust. I am sure that the Minister  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety will take what I have to say on  board, because I know that he is committed to providing patients with the best  possible care, even though he may not have the resources that he would like.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If another accident and emergency facility in our vicinity  is downgraded, similar to what happened at Whiteabbey Hospital and the  Mid-Ulster Hospital recently, and its services are transferred to Antrim Area  Hospital, that hospital will be put under tremendous stress and strain. We do  not want accident and emergency services at Antrim Area Hospital to collapse  due to additional pressures being put on them without any extra resources.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have read plenty of official reports, statements and  answers to written questions that have been tabled by various Members, all of  which say that we are committed to providing better accident and emergency  care. However, that is not what the doctors and nurses are telling us, and it  is certainly not what is being reported in the media.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Staff say that they are totally stretched from dealing with  new patients from the Mid-Ulster and Whiteabbey hospitals. If staff have to  deal with a further influx of patients from Glenavy, they will be pushed to  breaking point. There have been long waits and instances of patients having to  lie on trolleys, which is not the image that we want for our Health Service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I want to ask the Minister who will pick up  the slack if the accident and emergency unit at the Lagan Valley Hospital is  downgraded. Will Antrim Area Hospital have to deal with patients from Glenavy?  If so, how will it cope? Will the Minister provide more money, doctors and  nurses for Antrim Area Hospital? If so, where will those resources come from?  Those are simple questions that will be very difficult to answer.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  support the subject of the Adjournment debate. I do not intend to repeat all  the points that Paul Givan made. As far as I know, there is cross-party  agreement on the issue, and if any of the Ulster Unionist representatives who  sit on Lisburn City Council were here, they would say the same things that we  are saying.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The pending decision about A&amp;E is totally unwelcome in  Lisburn and, though it is a wee bit down the track yet, we hope that on the  basis of arguments made today the Minister might reconsider. Frankly, a minor  injuries unit on limited hours in a place as big as Lisburn will not suffice  for the needs of a population that size, and the population, as we have all  said, is increasing. Lisburn is not totally urban; much of it is widespread. As  Mr Givan said, it stretches to Dromara. I could mention Ballinderry, and as  Thomas Burns said, it includes Glenavy. We are talking about 110,000 people who  will not have ready access to an accident and emergency unit on a 24-hour  basis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Allow me to digress slightly. I have been a member of  Lisburn City Council for 10 years and there has hardly been a month when it has  not discussed the future of the Lagan Valley Hospital. There has been constant  concern among politicians and the population about where Lagan Valley Hospital  is headed. Everything seems to be a downgrade, rather than an upgrade.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I sympathise with the Minister in some ways. He has  difficult decisions to make in the broader scale of things. I welcome the new  operating theatre which we will now have in Lagan Valley Hospital as the major elective  surgery unit progresses. However, concerns are still widely voiced across Lagan  Valley about the future of the whole operation, particularly if we do not have  A&amp;E. I have to mention maternity services again, even though I got a bit of  an earful earlier when I asked about it. The problem with both those units is  that these things can become self-fulfilling. If we have a maternity unit that  is not used &mdash; which is our concern &mdash; some review in the future may decide that  we do not need it at all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The same goes for A&amp;E. The minor injuries unit is not  the most useful thing in the world to begin with; if it is not used fully, a  future review might decide to remove it. Where does this end? The large  population of Lisburn/Lagan Valley will end up without proper facilities at  all. I do not imagine that that is in the Minister&rsquo;s mind at the moment, but  who knows what will happen 10 years down the line? Twenty years ago, we would  have thought that none of these things were possible. We thought that there  would always be a maternity unit and an accident and emergency unit in Lisburn.  Now, evidently, one is going; the other, in some opinions, is under threat  through lack of use, but we will see about that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to what the Minister has to say about this.  The unanimous view across Lisburn is that he should reconsider this decision,  even in these times when his budgets are hard pressed and he is trying to  spread services across the country as best he can. As I said, I have sympathy  for him in that endeavour. However, I think the Department has got this one  wrong, and I look forward to what the Minister has to say about it.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue yet again, and I thank my  colleague Mr Givan for bringing this issue to the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Lunn said, this issue is constantly raised not only  by politicians, but also by those on the doorsteps of Lagan Valley. Whether or  not it is founded in reality, people have a fear that, one day, accident and  emergency services will be removed from the Lagan Valley.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">An invaluable resource resides in Lagan Valley Hospital,  and it would be wrong of me not to give the Minister some of the figures. No  doubt his Department has already given them to him. Lagan Valley Hospital&rsquo;s  emergency care department saw 33,627 people in attendance last year. The  majority of them, 89%, were new attendees, not people returning for additional  care.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In comparison with the Royal Victoria Hospital, for  example, it has about half the number of attendees. The Royal dealt with more  than 71,000 attendees and Belfast City Hospital with 45,000. There is extensive  use of the accident and emergency service in the Lagan Valley Hospital. The  comparison with Belfast City Hospital is significant and gives rise to a major  problem. If the services in Lagan Valley Hospital are to be run down, where, as  my South Antrim colleague asked, will those 33,000 individuals go?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The vast majority of people from Lagan Valley would  probably go to the Royal; fewer would attend the Ulster Hospital. As was  mentioned, Craigavon Area Hospital and Antrim Area Hospital would end up  dealing with many of those people. That aspect of winding down the accident and  emergency service at Lagan Valley Hospital causes a major issue. We all read  stories in the press about waiting times at the Royal. Some are measured in  hours, and, at times, when that hospital is stretched to the limit, people have  to wait for a considerable time in its accident and emergency department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of the 33,000 people who attend Lagan Valley at present,  none have sustained major injuries. Already, the instruction is that anyone  with a serious injury should bypass Lagan Valley Hospital and be taken to, for  example, the Royal, where major intervention can take place. Last night,  unfortunately, there was one such example, when a young child was knocked down  and received extremely serious head injuries. I pay tribute to all the  emergency services, including those in the Royal, where staff dealt with the  case. Their care of the individual was exceptional and possibly saved his life.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, if those 33,000 people who now attend Lagan Valley  Hospital were no longer able to do so, what impact would that have on resources  in the major acute hospitals in Belfast? The bulk of that number would start to  attend hospitals in Belfast, which would overstretch their already limited  resources. Would that result in putting someone&rsquo;s life in jeopardy? As I am not  a medical expert, I do not know. I simply crunch numbers in my head, and it  makes little sense to me. I fear that the change would stretch to the limit  resources that are already under pressure in, for example, the Royal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over recent days, Lagan Valley Hospital has had a major  issue with staff cover in its accident and emergency unit. I understand that the  hospital found it extremely difficult to get doctors to cover. On several  occasions, I have had to intervene and speak to the South Eastern Trust about  that issue. The trust had been using locums to provide emergency cover. It  seems that there is a shortage of doctors in the system as a whole.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The continual draw to centralisation in Belfast cannot  continue. As a Government, we do not have the resources or the funds to double  the capacity of the Royal and similar hospitals. For that reason alone, common  sense dictates that the Minister should make every attempt to keep open the  existing accident and emergency provision at Lagan Valley Hospital.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I add my  appreciation of the staff of the hospital and the South Eastern Health and  Social Care Trust, who are committed to providing high quality health and  social care to people in their community. I know that Lagan Valley Hospital is  greatly valued by the people of Lisburn and the surrounding area. No one in the  House should be unclear about my commitment to that hospital.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Just last week, I visited the hospital for the handover of  two new operating theatres, at an investment of &pound;3&middot;6 million, in which people  will be treated from next month. Around 4,500 to 5,000 operations are carried  out in the hospital each year, and the new theatres will offer a gold standard  in operating rooms. The theatres also signal my determination that Lagan Valley  Hospital should be equipped to fulfil one of the roles envisaged for it in the  Developing Better Services (DBS) strategy as a protected elective centre for  greater Belfast.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The DBS strategy also indicated that Lagan Valley would  become a local hospital with a minor injuries unit and a rehabilitation role  for older people in particular. The hospital will continue to provide a wide  range of services to its local community, including elective surgery,  outpatient clinics and endoscopy, diagnostic and rehabilitation services. The  strategy also envisaged that the hospital would no longer provide  consultant-led obstetrics but would have a midwife-led unit. I announced last  year that consultant-led maternity services would be transferred away from  Lagan Valley Hospital but would be replaced by that midwife-led maternity unit.  The trust is developing plans to establish that, and it will commence in  February 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The strategy also set out the broad direction of change for  hospital services across Northern Ireland. Everyone needs to <strong>understand that things cannot and will not  stay the same</strong>: we do not want them to stay the same. Services constantly  change because of advances in medicine, technology and procedures, and because  of need and demand. A simple method of measurement is to look at life  expectancy figures and the rates of cancer detection, for example. Far more  cancer cases are being detected each year, yet the mortality rate for cancer is  falling all the time. That demonstrates that what the Health Service is about  is working. It is also demonstrated by the way in which life expectancy has  been rising over the past 30 years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past 20 years, there has been a dramatic rise in  life expectancy. That demonstrates that, by evolving, the Health Service is  working and continues to work for the population. That is despite the fact that  our Health Service is the most badly funded Health Service in the UK. That  funding was voted through by the DUP and its colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in, supported  by their colleagues in the Alliance Party. That is where the money is. The DUP,  Sinn F&eacute;in and the Alliance <strong>Party voted  through cuts</strong>: &pound;700 million of so-called efficiency savings. They voted  through a Budget with cuts and set the Health Service huge challenges,  including that of a &pound;120 million cut made recently as a result of the so-called  black hole. That was voted through by the DUP, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Alliance  Party. To me, that does not demonstrate a genuine commitment to the Health  Service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members talked about Belfast versus Lisburn. We are not  dealing with John Lewis here. We are dealing with a Health Service that  provides for the whole of Northern Ireland. It is about regional provision. We  are not about equity of geography but about equity of outcome. This is about  ensuring that the entire population gets equity of treatment and outcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Craig spoke of medical expertise. An accident and  emergency unit is not just a room with doctors and nurses. It is what is  outside the back door that counts. The British Association for Emergency  Medicine (BAEM) states that the support necessary for an emergency department  or an accident and emergency unit is on-site acute medicine; a critical care  unit; imaging, including 24-hour CT scanning; laboratory services, or  pathology; paediatrics; surgery; and orthopaedics. To guarantee safety, a unit  must have on-site acute medicine, a fully staffed critical care unit, imaging,  including 24-hour CT scanning, and pathology as an absolute minimum. Those are  not available in Lagan Valley Hospital, and they have not been available since  I got involved; they have not been available for some time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, we debated medical negligence claims. That was  about acknowledging that some patients experience bad outcomes, but they are,  thankfully, a tiny minority that we seek to ensure gets smaller. What we cannot  do is endanger the population through unsafe practice. All of the medical  experts &mdash; including the British Association for Emergency Medicine, the Royal  colleges, consultants, nurses and health professionals &mdash; have the same message  and say the same <strong>thing about quality and  safety. Paul Givan talked about &ldquo;local&rdquo;, &ldquo;fast&rdquo; and &ldquo;safe&rdquo;. The service has got  to be safe</strong>: that is the key requirement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other matter that he neglected to mention was that we  also have an Ambulance Service that has been transformed in the past 20 years.  In effect, we ensure that we can take the A&amp;E to the patient, which is what  happens now with the very high quality Ambulance Service. It is not about going  out, ringing a bell and scooping people up to take them back to the nearest  hospital, it is about getting that emergency care out through the Ambulance  Service and stabilising the patient before going to the appropriate hospital.  Indeed, a number of protocols about Lagan Valley Hospital now operate because  it is routinely bypassed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Givan also talked about the reading of a letter at Clady  Villa, taking it totally out of context and misrepresenting it. He started to  talk a little about money and got closer to the subject when he did, because  he, and his colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in, backed by the Alliance, will not support  the Health Service. If he is serious about the accident and emergency unit in  Lagan Valley Hospital and had he listened to the debate this morning, he would  understand that, for safety purposes, we require investment in Lagan Valley  Hospital. The investment needed includes the development of on-site acute  medicine; a fully staffed critical care unit; and imaging, including 24-hour CT  scanning and pathology. Accident and emergency staff are very hard to recruit,  and not all of the A&amp;E units are managing to get all of the consultants  that they require; it is an effort. Even if we could get those staff, there  would be a very large price tag. It is a different argument if the DUP Members  and their colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in and in the Alliance Party are telling me that  they will vote that money through. As things stand, the funds are simply not  there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On another point, I do not know what sort of discussion  goes on in Lisburn, but it must be dire indeed if years have been spent talking  about this issue. There are no specific plans in the consultation document for  the Lagan Valley <strong>Hospital emergency  department</strong>: nothing is about to happen, anyhow. There has been a  consultation, which will provide an opportunity to discuss any concerns with  the trust. The business of saying that this is a done deal and all the rest of  it, saying &ldquo;Oh, woe is me&rdquo; and then carrying on scaremongering, is about  politics. It is playing politics: just tell the people of Lisburn that the  Lagan Valley Hospital accident and emergency unit will be closed and give them  an opportunity to vote for the hospital&rsquo;s defenders. It is a bit of a scare.  The DUP used to scare people about Sinn F&eacute;in: now they are their colleagues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Givan: Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety: No, I am not giving way. You had your opportunity. You used to scare  about Sinn F&eacute;in. Now they are your colleagues, so you are scaring about Lagan  Valley Hospital, and that is unfair. It is about &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, please. Minister, take your seat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Thank you.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: I remind all Members that remarks  are made through the Chair and not across the Floor of the House. Continue,  Minister.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I understand that he is a new Member and  that we are indulgent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As far as the Lagan Valley situation is concerned, playing  politics with health is the worst thing one can do. I am absolutely disgusted  when people start playing politics with health.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Givan: Hear, hear.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety: I heard that remark made from a sedentary position quite clearly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Lagan Valley Hospital has a very robust future. It will  deliver the overwhelming majority of hospital needs for the population in  Lisburn and the surrounding area. However, the reality is that someone with  cancer will not want to go to Lagan Valley Hospital; they will want to go to a  specialist acute service such as that in the Belfast City Hospital.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sorry that that is in Belfast and not in Lisburn. If  you have major trauma, you will go to the Royal. If a child requires specialist  children&rsquo;s medicine, he or she will go to the children&rsquo;s hospital in the Royal.  Someone with a specialist maternity need will go to the maternity hospital in  the Royal or to another one of the maternity services, of which there are a  number. The way that things are evolving, the services that we provide are  getting safer, but they are getting safer through specialisms. As Mr Craig  said, this is about medical expertise. I do not make those decisions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: The Minister should draw his remarks  to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety: It is about the advice that is coming from the Royal colleges and the  professions, and it would be a shame on us if we were not to heed that advice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 4.51 pm.</p>
