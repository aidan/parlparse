                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to advise Members that the Business
                Committee has allocated two hours for this debate. The proposer
                of the motion will be given 20 minutes to speak, and 10 minutes
                has been allocated for the winding-up speech. All other Members
                who wish to speak — and who get the opportunity to do so —
                will be allowed up to 10 minutes. Apart from the proposer of the
                motion, Members may speak only once. I remind Members that,
                given the number who wish to speak, they do not have to take
                their full 10 minutes. If some Members speak for less than 10
                minutes, then more Members can be facilitated.</p>

                Sinn Féin,</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">this Assembly resolves that Sinn Féin does
                not enjoy its confidence because it is not committed to
                non-violence and exclusively peaceful means and further resolves
                that, in accordance with Section 30 of the Northern Ireland Act
                1998, this Assembly determines that members of Sinn Féin shall
                be excluded from holding office as Ministers for a period of
                twelve months from the date of this resolution.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind the House that the last time a
                motion like this was before us, there were two motions saying
                the same thing. It was no stunt then, because there was an
                election. The Official Unionist Party was happy to have the
                benefits and to propose that particular motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is the policy of fascism to boycott an
                elected Assembly and then endeavour to gain influence in that
                Assembly to keep free debate from taking place. Surely debate on
                the subject should take place in this House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The spokesman of those that are absent from
                the Benches today was not prepared to say in public that he was
                calling for the abandonment of the IRA. How can he reconcile
                that position with the so-called Mitchell principles and the
                so-called peace policy that we are supposed to be pursuing?
                Those are the facts of the case. People who refuse to face up
                to, or vote on, the issue are showing that they faithfully want
                to keep the IRA in place. Anyone who does not vote for the
                motion is saying that Sinn Féin/IRA should be in the Government
                of Northern Ireland and should not be ejected from that
                Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the debate. Once again it is clear
                that the Official Unionist Party and its friends in the SDLP,
                alongside IRA/Sinn Féin, have tried to stop the debate. It is
                clear from Mr David Trimble’s attitude that he does not want
                the spotlight to fall on decommissioning. He wants to keep his
                party in union with IRA/Sinn Féin and carry on the charade that
                exists in Northern Ireland today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened with interest to the accusations
                he made in the House on 4 March when he said that there was an
                abuse of procedure in calling for this debate. What a cheek. The
                greatest abuse of procedure took place in the House on the day
                he relied on the Alliance Party and the Women’s Coalition for
                his election as First Minister, claiming that a majority of
                Unionists supported him. Those so-called Unionists backslid
                seconds later and went back to their old stands as Nationalists,
                or fellow travellers with Nationalists and Republicans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The majority of Unionists in the House do not
                support the stand that Mr Trimble is taking. On 8 October 2001,
                Mr Trimble claimed that the debate then was taking place before
                his party’s annual meeting. We are not interested in his
                annual meeting, because it will not change the position. He must
                be very scared of his party’s annual meeting if he thinks that
                a debate in the House will change the number of votes that he
                will receive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His party’s anti-agreement members are
                joining my party every day. What is more, people in his party
                are more interested in saving the party than saving the country,
                and he meets those difficulties by lining up with IRA/ Sinn
                Féin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate will take place. This is not a
                DUP motion only; other Unionists signed the petition. My party
                and other Unionists who are associating themselves with the
                motion — including Official Unionist Party Members — form a
                majority. Therefore, the Unionist majority supports the debate,
                and it must take place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is only one way for us to register
                opposition to IRA/Sinn Féin’s remaining in Government, and
                that is to vote for the motion. The only way to get proper
                decommissioning is to throw IRA/Sinn Féin out of the Executive.
                People will then wake up to the fact that we really mean
                business. We will hear spokesmen from the Official Unionist
                Party say that the debate is ridiculous, and it can do nothing.
                They can do something. They can put IRA/Sinn Féin out of the
                Executive, and the case for decommissioning will be established
                beyond doubt. There will be a complete change in attitudes
                across the water. That is the only way it can be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has never been a clearer choice to be
                made between terrorism and democracy than that which must be
                made today. It is no good supporting a quest against
                international terrorism while failing to stand up against one of
                the most ruthless killing machines in Western Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to press reports, world terrorist
                organisations, including the IRA, met recently at global
                terrorist conclaves. If the IRA is part of that conclave, it is
                one of the terrorist organisations with which the Assembly
                should be at war. However, instead of being at war with such
                organisations, the Assembly wants the IRA to sit in partnership
                as its blood brothers in the Government of this part of Her
                Majesty’s kingdom. Do Unionists want to go on sharing power
                with an organisation that retains its capability for terror and
                is directly engaged in terrorism at present?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Thursday 21 February 2002, Matthew Burns
                was shot dead in Castlewellan, County Down. He had previously
                been targeted by an IRA punishment squad but had fought it off.
                He was a kick-boxer and had made fools of the six-man squad.
                However, the IRA returned to shoot him at point-blank range. Are
                those the actions of a group that is committed to peace and
                democracy? The House must answer that question.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to cover those actions, IRA/Sinn
                Féin claims that they are the actions of dissident Republicans.
                That cannot cover the fact that, in the period between the
                signing of the Belfast Agreement and the end of 2001, there were
                over 180 paramilitary-style assaults and over 150 casualties
                from paramilitary-style shootings — all emanated from IRA/Sinn
                Féin and its associates. Many other incidents never reach the
                press. During the all-party talks, the former Irish Foreign
                Minister Dick Spring said that Sinn Féin/IRA could not be in
                Government by day and in terrorism by night. However, at present
                Sinn Féin/IRA is in Government by day — because of the votes
                of the Official Unionists in the House — and it is in
                terrorism by night.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP and its leader, the Deputy First
                Minister, have an obligation in today’s debate. If they
                believe that no terrorist should take part in the democratic
                system without repudiating terrorism, they should vote for the
                expulsion of Sinn Féin from Government. The DUP has
                consistently maintained that IRA/Sinn Féin must disarm fully
                and credibly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current talk, which I heard from the
                Unionist Minister Mr McGimpsey, is that there has been
                decommissioning — that is a joke. Does anyone who is in his or
                her right senses really believe that there has been
                decommissioning? No one knows where or when that decommissioning
                took place. No one knows what sort of weapons were taken and
                destroyed. No one knows where the weapons were destroyed. No one
                knows whether they could be examined after they were destroyed.
                The theory is that the weapons were thrown over the side of a
                boat. I do not know whether Gen de Chastelain put on a diver’s
                attire, went down to the seabed, pulled up those weapons,
                brought them to the surface, examined them and declared that
                they were out of order. I do not think that to dip a rifle or a
                machine gun in saltwater would transform it. Such weapons could
                be reusable, yet the House is told that that process constitutes
                decommissioning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An election is coming up in the Irish
                Republic. IRA/Sinn Féin would like to sit in coalition with the
                ruling parties there. That will create for them another symbolic
                lie with which to cod the people. Well, that might fool the
                people of the Irish Republic who need to be fooled, and it might
                fool the people up here who, for political reasons, want to keep
                them in power to save their own bacon, but it will not fool the
                people who really know the situation, and it will not fool the
                people in this Province whose relatives were murdered — and
                people are still being murdered — by IRA guns.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 26 May 1998, Mr Trimble said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;democracy dictates that before we will
                sit in an Executive with Sinn Féin we require a declaration
                that the ‘war’ is over, the standing down of ‘active
                service units’, the handing over of the remains of the ‘disappeared’,
                full co-operation with the Decommissioning Commission, an end to
                targeting and punishment beatings and actual disarmament
                itself.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That statement could not be clearer, and I
                challenge the Official Unionist Party leaders to table that. If
                that is what they believe and what they say they were elected
                on, they should table a motion to that effect in this House and
                see how many votes they get. If any of those Unionists dared to
                say in their constituencies what their votes will say in this
                House today, they would get very short shrift indeed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The time has come for us to recognise that
                there are IRA/Sinn Féin gunmen abroad who are prepared to shoot
                their fellow Roman Catholics or anyone else who stands in their
                way. It is happening now in our Province, and it is important to
                say that that can cease if a majority of Unionists come
                together, stand together and vote together today. That would be
                the end of IRA/Sinn Féin in this House — everybody knows that
                — but they have to be preserved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that the IRA continues its
                crimes, as I have said. Its members, known as the
                &quot;Colombian three&quot;, presently await trial in that
                country for their terror-training activities. When they were
                arrested, we were told that they had nothing to do with the IRA.
                At the beginning, it was said, they were on holiday and
                completely isolated. We were told that one of them had nothing
                to do with Cuba. Now, it has been admitted that they had
                everything to do with Cuba and with all the charges that have
                been laid against them. And yet, people in this Chamber are
                still in cahoots with them. After the happenings in Colombia,
                there was a certain amount of evidence that they had been
                teaching the terrorists there how to use certain weapons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today, we must decide if we are to perpetuate
                the lie that Sinn Féin/IRA members are just like the rest of us
                when, in reality, they are still terrorists. Those absent from
                those Benches today are no different from what they were before
                the Anglo-Irish Agreement or before they supposedly agreed the
                Mitchell principles. They have not changed one iota, and every
                decent person in this Province recognises that — and when
                certain politicians are questioned by their constituents, they
                recognise and admit it too.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is that not precisely why politicians and
                leaders of parties in the Irish Republic are saying that they
                would not tolerate Sinn Féin in the Government in the South?
                Yet, parties here — Ulster Unionist, SDLP and others —
                lecture us and tell us that we should tolerate them in Northern
                Ireland. Is that not the greatest hypocrisy of all?</p>

                However, it is also the greatest lie of all, because I do not
                believe a word of what they say in Dublin. If they had to have
                IRA/Sinn Féin in the Government in Dublin, they would take them
                in. Mr Ahern would kiss them on the cheek and try to make the
                same excuses that are made for them by Unionists in the North of
                Ireland, and I think that my hon Friend would agree with me.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are told that the IRA has decommissioned,
                yet people like Matthew Burns are shot dead and top IRA men are

                perfectly well that they want rid of any voice of opposition.
                They do not want to hear — they do not even want a debate like
                this one. In this part of the United Kingdom armed terrorists
                control an arsenal of guns, and their elected representatives
                stand up and defend that. Another party — supposedly defending
                traditional Unionism — agrees that those terrorists should be
                in Government and tells us that this is a farce. It is not a
                farce when it puts down a similar motion, or when it goes to the
                country. That party’s manifesto says that they want the people
                of Northern Ireland to understand the answers to these

                Why do I use the word &quot;excuse&quot;? I do so because the

                its tactics for confronting the Republican movement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us take a few moments to examine how the

                the time has come for us to recognise that gunmen are abroad.
                The time has come? I have heard such words from him before. He
                also said that the DUP really means business. We have often
                heard such words from the DUP. Where have the DUP been, and

                remember its European election advert in May 1979. It stated —

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion deals with Sinn Féin’s being in

                Members are aware of your attitude with regard to these debates.
                However, is it not startling that throughout the entire
                10-minute diatribe that we have just heard, there was not one
                mention of IRA/Sinn Féin or its culpability? Yet, from
                beginning to end, that diatribe attacked other Unionists, the
                very thing that the DUP was berated for on the radio today by a
                ministerial Colleague of the Member. In a debate such as this,
                is it in order for the Member, the apologist for IRA/Sinn Féin
                in the Ulster Unionist ranks, to contribute to the debate by
                spending 99% of his time recalling previous radio interviews and
                documents, and so on, but not addressing the issue of IRA/Sinn
                Féin in Government? The Member may be embarrassed by that; I
                know that he has little defence for it. Mr Speaker, surely it is
                your duty to the House to at least call him to order on those

                made such rulings in respect of previous references to Sinn

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is significant that the Assembly is
                debating the issue of decommissioning for the simple reason that
                when the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the Prime
                Minister of the Republic published the so-called implementation
                plan after the Weston Park talks, the obvious intention was to
                bury the issue of decommissioning, to restore the operation of
                the institutions established under the Belfast Agreement and to
                dispose entirely of any requirement to decommission. That
                implementation plan contained a mere reference to the idea of
                decommissioning, although at the same time it included a
                detailed list of concessions to IRA/Sinn Féin, including an
                amnesty that individually, and therefore collectively, amounted
                not merely to the appeasement of terrorism but to the
                legitimisation of terrorism itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his statement on 1 August, Mr Reid was
                entirely confident that Mr Trimble, as the leader of the Ulster
                Unionist Party, would comply with the requirements of the
                implementation plan, and in putting himself forward for
                re-election as First Minister on 6 November, Mr Trimble did
                indeed comply. That shows that Mr Trimble is perceived to be
                and, in fact, is a mere puppet in the hands of these so-called
                two Governments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amazing thing is that in the debate on
                the amnesty for terrorism Mr Trimble conceded that he does not
                know exactly what was agreed at Weston Park. Nevertheless, he
                was prepared to comply with the core requirement of Weston Park
                and put himself forward for re- election as First Minister in
                circumstances that in themselves should have been sufficient for
                him to refuse. He was re-elected in the context of a so-called
                putting of arms beyond use, which effectively amounted to a
                recognition by the two Governments of the right of the IRA to
                hold its arms and dispose of them at will. In other words, there
                was a recognition of the legitimacy of the holding of arms by
                this terrorist organisation — that is what that non-event
                really amounted to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As well as that, he allowed himself to be
                reinstated as First Minister on the basis of a vote that was an
                insult to the integrity of Unionism in the Assembly. That vote
                was based on cynical labelling and the use of the term
                &quot;Unionist&quot; to put those who were actually opposed to
                the Union and committed to terror into the Executive, and that
                was done with the support of parties whose entire significance
                lies in the fact that they are simply lackeys and bootlickers of
                terrorism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The interesting and significant thing on 6
                November is that there was an international context which meant
                that Mr Trimble was under no political imperative to restore the
                working of the Executive and restore the leaders of Sinn Féin/IRA
                to the Government of Northern Ireland — there was no political
                imperative whatsoever to do that because of the events of 11
                September 2001 in the United States and the quite proper
                reaction of the Bush Administration to those events. The
                reaction of the Bush Administration to the events of 11
                September 2001 was to draw a clear line between democracy and
                terror, and at the very time that Mr Bush was drawing that line,
                the IRA was demonstrating beyond the possibility of refutation
                that it was on the side of terror. It was actually demonstrating
                what everybody had known for decades — that it was at the very
                heart of international terrorism. Mr Trimble allowed himself to
                be reinstated as First Minister and the representatives of a
                terrorist organisation to be put back into the Government in an
                international context in which he could have done the exact
                opposite. He was under no imperative to do what he did.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the context of this debate it is important
                to ask a simple question: why should members of IRA/Sinn Féin
                never — and this is the position of my party — ever be in
                the Government of Northern Ireland? The answer is very simple:
                IRA/Sinn Féin is literally a murder machine. In the recent
                debate on the amnesty, numerous Members tried to equate the IRA
                with the security forces. There are a number of ways of making
                the distinction, and the one that I want to make now is this:
                the IRA exists to murder — that is why it exists — and the
                security forces, representing the legitimate monopoly of force
                by the state, exist to protect people from organisations such as
                the IRA. That is the distinction, and members of an organisation
                whose prime and only purpose is to murder should never be part
                of a Government — and certainly never part of a Government in
                the country where the murders were carried out. The whole thing
                is absolutely ridiculous and quite beyond belief.</p>

                detail, but I feel, Mr Speaker, that I have to be careful about
                how I go about it. I see that you are nodding. I have to be
                careful, but I will say that there are reputable authors and
                investigative journalists who, outside of this House, can make
                detailed claims about the activities of Members, without any
                fear of legal recourse by the named Members. The authors of the
                books and articles that name those Members as being involved in
                murder and the organisation of IRA terrorism know that in a
                civil action — the outcome of which depends on the balance of
                probability — those people could never swing the balance of
                probability in their favour because of the weight of the
                evidence. That is why they have never attempted to defend their
                names in a court of law.</p>

                point. Let me indicate, without naming the individuals involved,
                the type of claim that has been made. A Member of the Assembly
                has been named, by two reputable journalists, as being among the
                planners of Bloody Friday. I do not need to say that Bloody
                Friday was one of the most appalling atrocities that ever took
                place either in Northern Ireland or elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another Member has been named as being
                responsible for three atrocities — and many others, but I will
                mention three. First, in one of the most recent books on the
                IRA, he is named as having authorised the Enniskillen bomb.
                Secondly, in a recent newspaper article, he was linked to the
                Claudy bomb. Most of us have probably forgotten about the Claudy
                bomb, but it was one of the most tragic events in the history of
                the troubles, because it involved the death of a child.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same individual was named in a recent
                book, published approximately two years ago, as having
                introduced the human bomb into the arsenal of IRA terror. It
                might be worthwhile to explain what the human bomb is. One of
                the most lethal weapons in the terrorist conflict that is taking
                place in Israel is the suicide bomb. If the members of an
                organisation are committed to murder and terror, but have not
                got the bottle to commit suicide, they take an innocent member
                of the community, and, under threat of murdering his family, tie
                1,000 lb of explosives to him and tell him to go to a
                checkpoint. When he reaches the checkpoint, the people who are
                monitoring his movements press the button and the whole thing
                explodes. That is the human bomb.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first human bomb was a man called Patsy
                Gillespie. It was a most appalling atrocity. The mind that can
                conceive that and put it into effect is something that normal,

                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;…there would be insufficient time to
                establish confidence for Government participation to be
                realistic.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bleatings of politicians in the Republic
                suggest that private armies and the activities of shadowy
                vigilante groups cannot be permitted there, yet they are
                justified in Northern Ireland. Politicians in Dublin also cite
                IRA/Sinn Féin’s call for the early release of the murderers
                of Garda McCabe to back up their own exclusion case. It would
                appear that sauce for the political goose in the North is
                unbefitting for its Southern gander. Just as IRA/Sinn Féin is
                unpalatable to Nationalists and Republicans — in the true
                sense — in the South, so they are equally distasteful to the
                majority of Unionists in the North.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although IRA/Sinn Féin has had the time and
                opportunity in Northern Ireland to prove itself worthy of
                holding office, it has repeatedly failed to do so. Contrary to
                all the promises that it has given through the media, and
                despite its having been given more than one chance in the House,
                the frequency of punishment attacks is now higher than it has
                been since records began, and there were only two fewer shooting
                incidents last year than in 1975. Furthermore, it should be
                noted that the only reason that the number of shootings did not
                overtake that for 1975 is that the Republicans called an abrupt
                halt to such activity after 11 September to avoid putting Sinn
                Féin in an awkward situation as regards its backers in the
                United States.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let there be no doubt that violence is still
                Sinn Féin’s bargaining tool, and, more worryingly, as
                Unionism has witnessed, particularly since the signing of the
                Belfast Agreement, it can be turned on and off according to its
                political needs to gain additional concessions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The parties in the South believe that the
                concept of sharing collective responsibility with IRA/Sinn Féin
                is a non-starter. With no blushes at their astonishing
                hypocrisy, they state that issues of justice, the army, the
                police and — wait for it — the defence of the state are
                among its main reasons for that. The irony is that although Sinn
                Féin is deeply unwelcome to its Nationalist bedfellows and
                agreement-supporting acts in the South, it is deemed worthy of
                ministerial portfolios by a minority of Unionists, together with
                constitutional Nationalists in the North. Those Unionists who
                advocate the presence of two Sinn Féin Ministers in Northern
                Ireland need to consider whether politicians in the South, who
                are reluctant to give Sinn Féin/IRA houseroom, have a point.
                The fundamental question of whether IRA/Sinn Féin is fit to
                hold office must be considered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The harsh reality is that Sinn Féin remains
                tied by an umbilical cord to the IRA, and despite all its talk
                of freedom and freedom fighters, it is resolutely preoccupied
                with control. Internally it maintains a virtually military
                discipline, while externally it seeks to control those
                communities in which it has a presence. The party has a
                fundamental problem with the concept of freedom. It has not yet
                come to terms with the rights of others to disagree and to
                dissent, so violence becomes the end result.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is highlighted by the recent attack on
                an SDLP worker in Castlewellan, after which the SDLP Member for
                South Down eloquently stated that the attack might have been
                carried out by</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;…some element of Republicanism that
                couldn’t tolerate his criticism and tried to terrorise him
                into silence.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not apologise for reminding the House of
                the awkward subject of exiles and beatings, not to mention the
                murders since the start of 2001 to which the Provisional IRA
                have been linked. Although Sinn Féin/IRA might point out that
                Loyalists are now responsible for more attacks than the IRA —
                make no mistake, I remain unambiguous in my criticism of all
                paramilitary violence — the difference is that Loyalists have
                no hope of achieving a mere sniff of political power, this year
                or in the foreseeable future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, the umbilical cord that links
                Sinn Féin with the IRA also feeds other terrorist organisations
                like FARC, ETA and the PLO, even to the point of embarrassing
                the political hierarchy in front of its American supporters.
                Nevertheless, it rallies dutifully to the defence of those
                apprehended. Through its links with international terror,
                IRA/Sinn Féin has proven to be lacking in its commitment to the
                fundamentals of democracy and to the bottom line of law and
                order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members should remember when voting in these
                Lobbies that even while claiming to recognise the legitimacy of
                the gardaí — something which the RUC or the new Police
                Service will never achieve in the eyes of Republicans —
                IRA/Sinn Féin has never fully assisted officers investigating
                the Omagh bomb to bring the perpetrators to justice. Do such
                people and their policies merit authority over two of the most
                important Departments in the Executive?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Guns and government do not mix. Nevertheless,
                IRA/ Sinn Féin is brutally aware that political power comes
                through the barrel of a gun, and the terrorist leopard has no
                intention of changing its spots. Let there be no doubt that if
                Sinn Féin gets its way, it will soon be wielding executive
                power on both sides of the border — literally in two separate
                countries. That will give it an influence that is unattainable
                to any other political party or Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to be clear to those of my Unionist
                family: there will be little sympathy in future elections for
                those who make their own beds and later complain about the lumps
                in the mattress, or who sup with the devil and complain that
                their spoon was shorter than a 40 ft pole when it is too late.

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last year a magazine for young Republicans
                eloquently put forward the Republican agenda beyond a shadow of

                to say that enough is enough. We are still entitled to ask

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very clear that in its stated objective
                of seeking the exclusion of Sinn Féin, and pursuing an attack
                on the Good Friday Agreement, this is not a serious motion.
                Everything that has been said, and much of what remains to be
                said, will make that abundantly clear. The DUP is not serious
                about having any party or anyone excluded from the Executive —
                it never has been. It is serious only about trying to embarrass
                the Ulster Unionist Party on this occasion. It also wants to sow
                further dissension in the Unionist community in the hope of
                electoral gain from that embarrassment and dissension.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP is attempting to disrupt the workings
                of the Assembly by foisting on us a completely unnecessary and
                intentionally divisive debate. It exaggerates and continues to
                whip up, rather than allay, fears and apprehensions across the
                whole community — fears and apprehensions that, in many
                respects, I recognise to be genuine.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not my responsibility in this debate to
                defend any other party.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is my responsibility to defend and uphold
                the Good Friday Agreement, and to ensure that its benefits
                continue to flow for all our people. Those benefits can be seen
                in the progress that is being made towards lasting peace and
                political stability. We have a Government that are accountable
                to the people, and that pursue economic and social policies that
                have the potential to bring even greater benefits to all
                sections of the community. Despite all the difficulties and
                challenges, we have been gradually laying the foundations of a
                warm house for all, whatever their background, identity,
                affiliation or ultimate aspiration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise that in laying those foundations,
                we have much building left to do. However, in this enterprise,
                the DUP seems confused. It does not know what its role should
                be, or how it might play that role. [<i>Interruption</i>].</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the DUP were honest in its confusion, I
                would have greater respect for the position that it articulates.
                There is very little on which I agree with Mr Cedric Wilson and
                his Colleagues, but I acknowledge the honesty of their position
                in the Assembly. They say that they will not mix it with Sinn
                Féin, and they do not. If the DUP were serious, it would follow
                Mr Cedric Wilson’s example. However, it cannot resist the
                temptation to play political hokey-cokey: one leg in, one leg
                out; one arm in, one arm out. No wonder their Members’ heads
                spin in confusion all the time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DUP Ministers communicate in writing with my
                Executive Colleagues and me. Talking is merely another form of
                communication. The DUP Ministers ask the Executive, with their
                two Sinn Féin Ministers, to consider and approve their
                proposals. I am not the arbiter of the spending allocations that
                are made to Departments, but those DUP Ministers discuss their
                spending plans in detail with me, knowing that I must go and
                seek the endorsement of my Colleagues in the Executive. They ask
                that those Ministers approve their spending plans also.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP Members participate in district
                partnerships and local strategy partnerships. They work in local
                groups with representatives from all political parties,
                including Sinn Féin. The DUP Members apply for funds that are
                managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body, and other
                North/South agencies directed by the North/South Ministerial
                Council, with which they also claim to have no truck. [<i>Interruption</i>].</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hypocrisy and the cynicism of the motion
                can hardly be more transparent. There remains a serious
                obligation on all pro-agreement parties to advance all aspects
                of the Good Friday Agreement. There is an obligation to advance
                not only the institutions that have been established through
                that agreement, but the confidence- building measures that are
                contained in the agreement. Those include the obligation to
                promote decommissioning. Implied in that obligation is the
                obligation to rid society of paramilitarism. The SDLP has
                consistently made the argument that paramilitarism is
                inconsistent with democracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP has continued to make that argument
                not just in the Assembly but throughout the 30 years in which
                paramilitarism wreaked havoc in many sections of our community.
                Paramilitarism includes Loyalist and Republican paramilitaries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The progress that has been made must
                continue. Members place their trust in the work of the
                decommissioning body, and, with the support of the two
                Governments, the SDLP and other pro-agreement parties, it has
                worked hard to ensure that decommissioning will be progressed,
                and, ultimately, that it will be successful. Therefore
                paramilitarism, which has been a poison in our society, will be
                completely eliminated sooner rather than later. The warm house
                that we are building with confidence can then continue to be
                built, and it can shelter all, even those who oppose its
                construction.</p>

                believe that apologists for gunmen should have no place in

                they want a Government involving IRA/Sinn Féin, or a Government
                that are exclusively and totally committed to peaceful and
                democratic means? We must not forget that while we are here to
                debate this important motion on the exclusion of IRA/ Sinn Féin,
                many still carry the wounds of 30 years of terrorism. There are
                widows carrying broken hearts and children longing for the
                return of their fathers, but that will never happen because of
                terrorism. However, that does not seem to matter to many

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many elected representatives of the Unionist

                people whom they have murdered for the past 30 years? It is
                pathetic that the Ulster Unionist Party could muster only a
                lookalike mortician and a comedian on the Front Bench instead of
                taking this matter seriously.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP has been castigated for carrying out
                stunts. What greater political stunt is there than the abuse of
                having a First Minister elected without the support of the
                majority of Unionists in the Chamber? It was he, in his dash to
                power, who put IRA/Sinn Féin terrorists into the heart of
                Government. The Ulster Unionist Party is guilty of putting them
                there. However, it could join with the rest of the Unionist
                family to put them out. The Ulster Unionist Party has run away

                competition from the rest of his party, for they are not in the
                House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate clearly shows, as the vote will
                show, that the majority of Unionists in the House do not agree
                with Sinn Féin/IRA’s being in Government. One of David
                Trimble’s main policies in allowing Gerry Adams and Martin
                McGuinness — the representatives of gunmen — to be in
                Government is not supported by the majority of Unionists in the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the Member will agree, as he looks at
                the Bench on the other side, that not one Member of the
                Republican and Nationalist parties — especially those
                Nationalists who are supposed to believe in democracy — is in
                his place. Nevertheless, having made that clear outside, they
                were still called to take part in the debate.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That will speak volumes. The majority of
                Unionists outside the House do not support Mr Trimble and the
                Ulster Unionists. It is with them — the electorate — that
                David Trimble will finally fall, and may that happen soon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s vote will also demonstrate that
                there is no cross-community support for David Trimble or Mark
                Durkan to be the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.
                They require more than 50% of the votes of the House. I
                challenge them, if they are so confident, to resign their posts
                and put themselves forward for re-election. When Mr Trimble was
                returned to office he did so on the back of the greatest cheater’s
                charter ever. We are lectured about morality, honour, honesty
                and truth; yet, the proponents of the agreement are not prepared
                to go through the proper democratic process, because they know
                that they do not have the support in the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No other society, indeed no other Government,
                would tolerate such a situation. There is no better example of
                that than the Republic’s Minister John O’Donoghue, who
                unequivocally ruled out his party’s entering into Government
                with Sinn Féin/IRA because they were associated with a private
                army, and he stated that they could, therefore, not be trusted
                with matters such as defence, justice and security. The
                hypocrisy of Fianna Fáil in promoting, and advancing at every
                turn, the inclusion of Sinn Féin/IRA in the Executive
                Government of Northern Ireland is absolute, when Bertie Ahern
                scorns their presence in the South.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IRA/Sinn Féin has not changed its ways; it
                has not decommissioned. Instead, it chooses to target, train and
                murder. Mr McGimpsey claims that the great achievement of the
                Ulster Unionist Party is that it achieved decommissioning. Mr de
                Chastelain tells us that he does not know where he was, he does
                not know how he got there, he does not know who went with him,
                and he cannot say how much material he saw or did not see, but
                he knows that he left the weapons and the bunkers safely under
                the control of the Provisional IRA. That is a tremendous
                achievement for Mr McGimpsey and Mr Trimble to beat their chests
                and cry</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The events of Sunday 17 February 2002, in my
                constituency of Mid Ulster, highlighted the real agenda of
                IRA/Sinn Féin. Found in the heart of McGuinness’s territory
                was a sophisticated rocket launcher and warhead. Those arrested
                are well-known IRA members. What was IRA weaponry doing on the
                move? Had this not been decommissioned? We know that nothing has
                been decommissioned. Make no mistake about it: these were intact
                weapons of war to execute and murder the ordinary decent
                citizens of my constituency. The Ulster Unionist Member, Billy
                Armstrong — where is he today? — said in the ‘News Letter’
                on Tuesday 19 February 2002:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Once again we see the contempt that
                republicans have for the peace process.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely in the light of those words he should
                back the motion, or else he is a hypocrite saying something for
                public consumption while supporting IRA/Sinn Féin in the House.
                We know that he will be an obedient poodle who will do his
                master’s bidding when the strings are pulled. Those who fail
                to back the motion are registering their support for, and
                placing their confidence in, IRA/ Sinn Féin. The IRA has never
                shown any remorse for its deeds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reality of the debate is that it reflects
                that decommissioning has yet to occur, and that the IRA has no
                intention of decommissioning. Mr Trimble and his Weston Park
                negotiating team told us that decommissioning was the only item
                on the agenda to be dealt with. Yet he and Jeffrey Donaldson
                breathed life into a talks process that led to a five-page
                document in which 67 words dealt with decommissioning, and the
                rest detailed the destruction of policing and security
                installations and attempts to put the IRA back into Government.
                What a set of negotiators; considering that Weston Park
                delivered promises for an on-the-run amnesty that is being
                developed for IRA murderers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist Party in its document,
                ‘Understanding the Agreement’, claimed:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Decommissioning alone, of course is not
                enough. Paramilitary organisations must stand down their units,
                and the IRA must indicate that the war is over.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ulster Unionists who fail to support the

                electorate into the ground. They will also be registering a vote
                of confidence in Martin McGuinness and his friends within the
                IRA murdering machine.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have said, in no other democratic
                country in the world would there be terrorists in Government.
                However, of course, we find one here in the post of Minister of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am reminded that the Provisional IRA has,
                down through the years, murdered schoolteachers, schoolchildren,
                principals, students, others who work in schools and school bus
                drivers. Many innocent victims have been murdered in the
                presence of young people and students. Millions of pounds have
                been wasted through damage to schools and universities by IRA
                bombs. There remains a crisis in education funding, which can,
                in part, be attributed to 30 years of terrorist onslaught
                directed against us by the Provisional IRA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the same Minister who, after the
                elections to Londonderry City Council on 16 May 1985, said:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We do not believe that winning
                elections and winning any amount of votes will bring freedom to

                the IRA that will bring freedom.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Mr Trimble addressed the Assembly the
                other day he told the DUP and its friends to get out of the
                place, but he did not tell Martin McGuinness or the members of
                the IRA to leave this place to true democracy and to true
                democrats.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is simple: we can choose to
                exclude the political representatives of the most brutal killing
                machine in Western Europe and take a stand for democracy,
                decency and justice, or we can choose to allow them to remain in
                the Chamber with their stockpile of weaponry, dancing on the
                graves of thousands. Make no mistake, we will hear from Mr
                Trimble that, prior to the election, he will have a stunt for
                the electorate, and the IRA will have a stunt to seal or open
                another bunker prior to St Patrick’s Day and the Irish
                Republic’s election.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With one brief period of exception, the party
                that is the subject of the motion has lived up to its old
                nickname and has effectively run away today. We are confronted
                by the absence of the party opposite, but it is not the silence
                of the lambs; rather it is the silence of the wolves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are reminded of the flexibility of the
                English language. When the phrase &quot;motion for
                exclusion&quot; is used by anti-agreement Unionists, the words
                become equated with &quot;stunt&quot;, &quot;joke&quot; and
                &quot;political escapade&quot;. We are accused by that erstwhile
                visitor to Northern Ireland, Lord Kilclooney, of tabling the
                motion for narrow political purposes. To be fair to Lord
                Kilclooney, the next time he comes here, he might include a
                visit to the Policing Board. Yet, when the First Minister uses
                the phrase &quot;motion for exclusion&quot;, he is suddenly said
                to be taking a stand of courage against the ravages of
                terrorism; he is showing decisive leadership and using a device
                to force Sinn Féin to decommission — the motion to exclude
                suddenly becomes something noble.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s debate was inevitable, because when
                the Government were re-established in November, there was no
                firm basis. When we were deciding whether to re-elect the First
                Minister and establish the Government, two questions were raised
                about decommissioning by others and me. We needed to know
                whether we were establishing a secure Government, so we asked
                for clarity on what the supposed act of decommissioning had
                been. Secondly, we asked if it was a one-off gesture or part of
                a process. As responsible politicians, my Colleague, Pauline
                Armitage, and I and others went to Gen de Chastelain — the
                only person who could give us an answer. We had a lengthy
                meeting and asked him a wide range of questions. It has already
                been said that there was no detail on the methodology, the
                amount and where or when decommissioning had taken place. One
                phrase that was bandied about was that &quot;the amount was
                significant&quot;. Gen de Chastelain denied that he had said
                that the amount was significant. One of my Colleagues asked him
                if, given that he had described the IRA event and the LVF action
                as significant, he still regarded the LVF act as significant.
                The general replied that he did and for the same reasons as he
                had at the time. He said that an event had taken place and that
                it was &quot;significant&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the light of the LVF’s subsequent
                actions, for anyone, Nationalist or Unionist, to draw
                reassurance from the significance of its decommissioning shows
                how paltry the reassurance from Sinn Féin was. The more
                important question about whether Sinn Féin is fit to be in
                government is not about the actions that it has taken in the
                past, but about its future intentions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gen de Chastelain was asked several questions
                on this, for example &quot;You are saying that the only
                commitment by the IRA has been to meet again soon. There has
                been no commitment to any second act of decommissioning?&quot;
                The answer was &quot;That is correct. The only formal commitment
                has been the one they made publicly to initiate a process to put
                arms beyond use on 6 May last year. However, we do not want to
                be involved in a one- off event.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another question was &quot;Am I correct in
                saying that there has been no specific commitment by the IRA to
                a timetable?&quot; The answer was &quot;That is correct.&quot;
                Yet another question was &quot;Is it also the case that they
                have given no specific commitment to complete
                decommissioning?&quot; The answer was &quot;That is also
                correct.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In November many of us warned that we had
                seen a cynical gesture, aimed simply at getting Sinn Féin back
                into government and the First Minister back into his position.
                We were told that we were scaremongers who were opposed to
                peace. However, there has been no commitment — and, more
                importantly, no action — by Sinn Féin to move towards a
                peaceful way forward and complete decommissioning.</p>

                prospect — immediate or otherwise — of any further event. As

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems strange that this is happening four
                months after it seemed appropriate to set up the Government. The
                first time the Government were set up, continuing without
                decommissioning was said to be intolerable after two and a half
                months. However, not only has the First Minister failed to back
                the motion, but there has not been even a vague hint of
                sanctions against Sinn Féin/IRA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not solely the absence of
                decommissioning that renders Sinn Féin’s continued role in
                government incompatible with democracy; it is their daily
                activities, such as punishment shootings, criminality,
                occasional murders, exiling of people, beatings, gangsterism and
                refusal to end the war.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nationalist politicians and media
                commentators on both sides of the border often tell me that we
                cannot expect 30 years of terrorism to end overnight, and that
                it will gradually peter out. However, it is probably more than
                seven and a half years since the first ceasefire, and we have
                not seen the violence peter out. We have seen the paramilitary
                activity tighten its hold on the community, and the authorities
                have consistently turned a blind eye to it.</p>

                that, whether the violence came from the Loyalist or Republican
                side, it cannot be attributed to mainstream paramilitary
                organisations. It is supposedly the work of dissidents and
                mavericks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must be grateful that the NIO was not in
                charge of this country in 1939. We can imagine the sort of
                statements that would have been produced after the invasion of
                Poland. It might have said that it was not the work of the Nazi
                Party, which was committed to the European peace process, but of
                a few dissident, maverick Germans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, the Government, having examined the
                situation, could declare that Herr Hitler was still on
                ceasefire. Humour aside, every time that the Northern Ireland
                Office turns a blind eye to recurring Loyalist and Republican
                terrorist activity, it effectively gives it a green light. It
                says to terrorists that as long as they do not stir things up by
                making it obvious who is directly involved or by killing people
                from the other community, it will not place sanctions on their
                activity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it is not only the Northern Ireland
                Office that has a responsibility. Assembly parties, including
                the UUP and the SDLP, have a moral responsibility. The House
                heard many fine words from Minister Farren, who told us that
                terrorism is incompatible with democracy and that it could not
                be tolerated. It has been tolerated by Assembly parties for too
                long. The House has heard enough of fine words. It is time for
                parties to commit themselves to sanctions. The one sanction that
                is available with regard to Sinn Féin/IRA that would have any
                effect, or afford an opportunity to achieve decommissioning, is
                exclusion from office until that decommissioning has been
                completed and terrorism has been brought to a halt. I urge not
                only the UUP but also the SDLP to stand shoulder to shoulder
                with us, the other democrats in the Assembly, and to have the
                courage of their convictions. Instead of SDLP Members skulking
                in their offices today, they should come into the Chamber and
                vote for the motion. That would send out a clear signal that the
                Assembly will no longer tolerate the terrorism of Sinn Féin or
                Republican and Loyalist paramilitary groups. I urge Members to
                support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that Ministers and those in senior
                Government positions in the rest of the UK are rightly removed
                from office for crimes such as lying, misappropriation and
                financial impropriety, the people of Northern Ireland are
                entitled to ask why the Assembly must debate the issue of the
                removal of someone from Government who, as Minister of
                Education, boasts openly to schoolchildren about his days on the
                run when he avoided proper retribution for such crimes as the
                House has heard of today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Northern Ireland would also be
                correct to ask why, as Dr Paisley and others have asked, the
                Government of the Republic of Ireland, the other co- sponsor of
                the Belfast Agreement, have different criteria for those who are
                considered to be fit to hold office. Although I agree with Dr
                Paisley that there may not be much genuine intent on Mr Ahern’s
                behalf, he has set the criteria that the IRA must decommission
                all its weapons, and that Sinn Féin must divorce and dissociate
                itself completely from the IRA before it can sit in an
                Administration in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hypocrisy of the British and Irish
                Governments comes as no surprise to anyone in Northern Ireland.
                They are the people who forced the iniquitous Belfast Agreement
                on the poor, unsuspecting, decent, law- abiding citizens —
                Protestant and Catholic, Unionist and Nationalist. The agreement
                is now starting to show its true colours. It is quite clear that
                the Belfast Agreement was created because the British and Irish
                Governments decided that they would appease terrorism rather
                than challenge it or deal with it. My Colleague Mr Roche has
                related, in graphic detail, the crimes committed by the people
                who now sit in Government over those whom they terrorised. These
                people have still not been brought to book for crimes such as
                the murder of Patrick Gillespie.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why do we have such an Assembly, an elected
                body, in Northern Ireland? People had high hopes that the
                Assembly would be a starting point for a devolved
                Administration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It stemmed from the two Governments’
                decision to pay the price to get the terrorists off their backs.
                However, it could not have happened without the betrayal of the
                Unionist and, indeed, of the wider community, by Mr Trimble and
                his Colleagues. Moreover, it was Mr Trimble who permitted those
                people to be brought into government in Northern Ireland. That
                diametrically opposed his pledge in 1998 in an Ulster Unionist
                Party document that encouraged people to vote &quot;Yes&quot; in
                the referendum. Mr Nesbitt is clutching at straws when he points
                to what he deems an act of decommissioning. They are no doubt
                hoping that there will be another event or stunt in the next
                week or two, whereby Sinn Féin/IRA will try to build some
                confidence, as they call it.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble set a higher criterion that is, in
                fact, closer to that of the Taoiseach, Mr Ahern. He pledged that
                the UUP would not serve in the Executive Committee with any
                party that is not genuinely committed to peace. If anyone is in
                any doubt about what that means, he goes on to say that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the commitment to peaceful and
                non-violent means is incompatible with the existence of a
                private army. Decommissioning alone, of course, is not enough.
                Paramilitary organisations must stand down their units, and the
                IRA must indicate that the war is over.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask Ulster Unionists to judge that against
                the present situation and to explain why they are still in this
                House and in the Executive with Sinn Féin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must face reality. People will undoubtedly
                ask why, even if every Unionist were present and voted for the
                exclusion of Sinn Féin from the Executive, the motion would not
                succeed. It is because, under the present system,
                cross-community support is required. Undoubtedly, support would
                not be forthcoming from Sinn Féin’s bedfellows in the SDLP,
                the Women’s Coalition and perhaps even from those who still
                claim to have some element of Unionism in their loyalty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is only one way in which the community
                and the House can rid itself of the spectacle of Mr Martin
                McGuinness and Ms de Brún fronting a party that is inextricably
                linked to a terrorist organisation, and I ask anyone to
                challenge my thinking and reasoning on this. Given that the two
                Governments will not do it for us, the only effective and
                possible means of removing Sinn Féin from office is for the
                Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party to
                resign their ministerial positions. The Executive cannot
                continue without a Unionist input.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Dr Paisley, and I shall face his
                challenge fairly and squarely. He rightly said that the DUP’s
                leaving the Executive today would not bring about the demise of
                the Executive. However, it would clearly leave Mr Trimble
                exposed. I appeal to my Colleagues in the Democratic Unionist
                Party to do that to him to leave him naked and alone in an
                Executive with those fronting paramilitary organisations. That
                would be the beginning of the end of this unholy edifice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Ulster Unionist Party and the DUP
                cannot bring this process to an end and remove Sinn Féin/IRA
                from the Executive before the end of this Assembly session and
                so allow them into the next Assembly session, they will be
                equally guilty of betraying the electorate and the decent people
                of Northern Ireland. Our future, the future of democracy and the
                future of those who hold dear decency and the entire structure
                of law and order in this Province is in our own hands.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is in the hands of every Unionist in the
                Chamber, and I ask for a united Unionist front on the issue. As
                the Ulster Unionist Party approach the Ulster Unionist Council
                meeting on 9 March I ask them not to consider what is right for
                David Trimble or the yes/no divisions in that party but to ask
                themselves how democracy can best be served and proper
                structures put in place. That cannot be done by propping up the
                system that was set up under the Belfast Agreement. I leave the
                Unionist community to determine whether there is a will in
                Unionism to deal with the issue of terrorists in Government.
                Only through a united Unionist approach can Sinn Féin/IRA be
                removed from Government.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Armitage:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Again, the deadline for total decommissioning
                — 28 February — has passed. The original date was May 2000.
                In a letter to David Trimble before the referendum on the
                Belfast Agreement, Prime Minister Tony Blair said that
                decommissioning must begin immediately the Assembly elections
                were over, that there was a limit of two years for the
                completion of this process and that all participants had to
                reaffirm their commitment to the total disarmament of all
                paramilitary organisations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Prime Minister went on to assure David
                that if the provisions in the agreement were not strong enough
                on that point then he, the Prime Minister, would introduce the
                necessary legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist Party also made
                commitments to the electorate. It said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The UUP will hold all parties and the
                Prime Minister to these commitments. The UUP will not serve in
                the Executive Committee with any party which is not genuinely
                committed to peace.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It went even further:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The UUP regards actual decommissioning
                as evidence of a commitment to totally peaceful and democratic
                means. In any event, the UUP will refuse to serve alongside any
                group of … terrorists. The commitment to peaceful and
                non-violent means is incompatible with the existence of a
                private army. Decommissioning alone, of course, is not enough.
                Paramilitary organisations must stand down their units, and the
                IRA must declare that the war is over.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are not my words. I am quoting from the
                Ulster Unionist Party document ‘Understanding the Agreement’.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All my life I have been loyal to the Ulster
                Unionist Party. Now I have been suspended because I decided to
                stand by that document and my election manifesto. As an Ulster
                Unionist I look forward to the day when a policy of removing
                terrorists from the Government of this part of the United
                Kingdom will mean that my loyalty to that party can continue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been no decommissioning about which
                we can be certain. There was, apparently, a significant act of
                decommissioning in October 2001. There is nothing more to report
                at the moment, so Tony Blair has had another bright idea. He
                will slightly change the criminal justice procedures. The coat
                of arms will remain in some courts, and the Union flag will fly
                on designated days.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The UUP has talked of its achievements on the
                criminal justice procedures. It should not have signed up in the
                first place to an agreement that would remove the Union flag and
                the coat of arms. Had it not agreed to that, it would not have
                had to fight so hard to retain the status quo.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Blair and Mr Reid will doubtless announce
                an amnesty for terrorists on the run. Since that was never part
                of the Belfast Agreement, smiling, lying Tony decided to serve
                up a wee sweet pill to the Unionist community before the real
                — bitter — one. No one should be surprised; we have seen it
                all before.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The terrorists who carried out the Teebane
                massacre, killing workmen who were travelling home after an
                honest day’s work, will be free to do what they want and to go
                where they like. The same applies to the Enniskillen bombers and
                to the terrorists responsible for the attack on the Darkley
                Mission Hall and for the Kingsmill massacre, La Mon and Bloody
                Friday — to name but a few.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that the concessions agreed
                at Weston Park were in exchange for an act of decommissioning in
                October 2001. There was one item on the agenda at the Weston
                Park talks — decommissioning. Now, months later, we still have
                no decommissioning, just more concessions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who altered the agenda? I had a meeting with
                Mr Trimble, and he told me that the Prime Minister had changed
                the agenda, and that he — Mr Trimble — was very annoyed. I
                repeated my question. Again, Mr Trimble looked at me and said
                &quot;I was very annoyed&quot;. Perhaps our Prime Minister
                should spend more time trying to defeat terrorism in the United
                Kingdom, and less time trotting around the world talking tough
                on terrorism. Would Mr Blair allow terrorists to hold
                ministerial posts in his Government? Even the terrorists’ best
                friend, Bertie Ahern, does not want them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following a murder in Castlewellan, County
                Down, a Sinn Féin Member said that he was 100% sure that the
                IRA had had nothing to do with it. However, Members are always
                told that Sinn Féin cannot speak for the IRA and that it knows
                nothing about the IRA’s guns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a reasonable person, I accept that members
                of Sinn Féin have been elected. Members of Sinn Féin live
                here, and I ask them to decommission their illegal weapons. That
                was part of the great and wonderful Belfast Agreement that they
                signed up to, and which they want to see implemented in full. Mr
                Adams has said that he is going to try to persuade moderate
                Unionists like me to join him in a new, agreed United Ireland.
                Well, Gerry could make a positive start. He could start by
                decommissioning all his illegal weapons. I still will not join
                his United Ireland, but I will try to make him feel more welcome
                in my United Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Decommissioning always seems to get a
                reprieve. The deadline was originally May 2000; that became
                February 2001; and now it has been extended to 2006 or 2007. Why
                do Members accept those deadlines? The Royal Ulster Constabulary
                was not granted a reprieve on its disbandment, uniform changes
                or recruitment policies. Why? It was because Members of the
                House would not have accepted it. How then can Members of the
                House accept a process with no decommissioning? Surely
                decommissioning is at the very heart of the peace process.
                Repeatedly extending the deadline gives the impression that
                decommissioning is not really that important. Sinn Féin can sit
                back, retain its weapons and seek more and more and more
                concessions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone in this House should be equal when
                it comes to creating a peaceful, prosperous Northern Ireland. I
                have no guns, bullets or Semtex to use as a bargaining tool. I
                have nothing more than my conscience, my memories of my murdered
                friends and my honest belief that I have a right to see
                decommissioning now, rather than in 2007.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appeal to the Prime Minister, his
                Government and Mr Trimble to stand by their commitment to
                decommissioning as part of the peace process. We will possibly
                see another bunker sealed within the next few days. I hope that
                members of the Ulster Unionist Party do not jump up and down
                with excitement, because it is not for their good, my good or
                the good of Ulster — it is so that Sinn Féin might get a few
                extra votes in the elections in the Irish Republic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The relatives of those who gave their lives
                for this country must wonder why they did it, for we now share
                power with the men and women who murdered their loved ones. I
                wonder how the Unionists in this House will be recorded in
                history. We will not be around to see that, but we have children
                and will have great-grandchildren, to whom we have already given
                a murderer and a bomber as a Minister for their education. I
                suggest that we do not let them down again. I support the
                motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will be brief, to allow the Member to have
                sufficient time for his winding-up speech. I wish to reply to
                some of the points of those who attacked the DUP and then
                scurried out of the Chamber, because they did not have even the
                courtesy to listen to the rest of the arguments. The absence of
                other parties from the House, with some exceptions, shows
                contempt not for certain parties, but for the people of Northern
                Ireland. Those parties try to downplay the importance of
                decommissioning, yet no issue is more important to the people of
                Northern Ireland than the way in which the so-called peace
                process has allowed people to be in Government while holding on
                to paramilitary weapons and maintaining a paramilitary
                organisation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If those Members think that the issue will be
                brushed under the carpet because they are absent, they have
                another think coming. Even the parties in the South recognise
                the dangers that they might face and are speaking out on the
                issue. As my hon Friend said, undoubtedly they speak with forked
                tongues, but they make the same point. However, some Unionists
                still sit silently in the Chamber, or on their hands, and are
                prepared to allow IRA/Sinn Féin in Government in Northern
                Ireland, although Nationalists and Republicans in the South do
                not, and would not, support their presence in Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some 99% of the Ulster Unionist Party’s
                contribution to the debate was a tirade of abuse against the
                DUP, based on a series of documentation. Some of the UUP were
                members of the DUP for much of the time that the documents
                referred to. I see one of the Members, from Lisburn, who will
                undoubtedly be opposed to what Mr Nesbitt said, as he supported
                many of the policies at the time and is on record as saying so.
                The UUP has no defence against our arguments for the exclusion
                of IRA/ Sinn Féin. IRA/Sinn Féin is a paramilitary-linked
                organisation, which is part and parcel of the Republican
                movement, and which is engaging in paramilitary, violent
                activity today — never mind its history. It has never
                apologised for that history, and it has never disowned it. It
                should not be in Government. Rather than take that issue on, the
                UUP prefers to attack other Unionists. Mr McGimpsey had the
                audacity to say on the radio this morning that the motion was
                really an attack by the DUP against Ulster Unionists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren said that the DUP was confused. The
                only people in Northern Ireland who are confused about the
                Democratic Unionist Party’s position are Dr Farren and those
                who oppose the DUP. I am glad that he has finally had the
                courtesy to reply, since he did not have the courtesy to wait to
                hear the other arguments, but scuttled out as soon as he had
                finished his own speech.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren spoke about the DUP’s taking the
                Pledge of Office, an issue that I heard about on the radio this
                morning. The DUP took the Pledge of Office, subject to its
                electoral commitments and manifesto. It acts entirely in
                accordance with that procedure and those commitments, unlike
                others, and it abides by those manifesto commitments. Mr Trimble
                and the Ulster Unionist Party proposed the exact same motion
                before the last election, as the hon Member for North Down Mr
                Weir pointed out. When that party proposed the motion, it was
                considered to be a tremendous act of courage, designed to take
                on the IRA; now it is considered to be a stunt. The difference
                is that, at that time, there was an election coming up, for
                which Mr Trimble needed support. He thought that the motion
                would give him some cover.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Dr Paisley said, if the Ulster Unionist
                Party is prepared to leave office, the DUP will not remain in
                the Executive. However, if the DUP were to leave its ministerial
                positions now, those positions would be taken by its enemies and
                used to advance the pro-agreement agenda.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Likewise, it has been agreed by all
                anti-agreement Unionists that it would be wrong to leave the
                Assembly, even though Sinn Féin is part of it — we have to be
                here to take Sinn Féin on. We have to ensure that we use the
                tactics that were endorsed by the electorate when they were put
                to them at the recent election. There is no confusion — the
                people are clear, and we are clear. We are going to remain here
                to harry and harass Mr Trimble, IRA/Sinn Féin, the SDLP and
                anyone else who wishes to implement the pro-agreement agenda.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a regrettable matter, but one of which
                the pro-Union supporters will no doubt take note, that the
                Ulster Unionist Party, in league with Irish Nationalists and
                Republican parties, has confined this important debate to two
                hours.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">None of those parties — and especially not
                Sinn Féin — wishes to have an issue central to the very heart
                and concept of democratic government fully debated in a public
                forum. The number of Ulster Unionist and SDLP Members, to say
                nothing of Sinn Féin, present for this debate on such a central
                issue is nothing short of a democratic disgrace, and the
                contributions of some, such as Dr Farren, are nothing short of
                democratic depravity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The peace process was allegedly based on the
                negotiation of a political settlement between parties dedicated
                to a peaceful democratic process. It was claimed that only those
                who eschewed violence as a means of achieving political
                objectives, and who were permanently committed to non-violent
                means, were to be included. However, Sinn Féin/IRA bombed and
                murdered its way, not only into the negotiations, but into
                Government over those whom it had terrorised, while the security
                forces who have upheld the rule of law have been downgraded and
                demeaned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The peace process and the institutions that
                it has spawned were merely a cover for conflict resolution
                between the British Government and violent Republicanism,
                camouflage for the appeasement of terrorism to obtain not an end
                to acts of terrorism, but an end to such acts on the British
                mainland. The Belfast Agreement was conceived as the product of
                political terror, and it survives because of the threat of
                renewed mainland terror.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The price of England’s safety was the
                promise to Sinn Féin/IRA of a transitional process towards
                Irish unity, and the retention by Sinn Féin/IRA of its weaponry
                is its means of ensuring that perfidious Albion antes up in the
                fulfilment of its undertaking. Nothing else can explain the
                abandonment by the British Government of every position that
                they have taken on the need for decommissioning. They have
                exaggerated the significance of, and accepted, every ambiguous
                and deceptive statement on decommissioning made by Sinn Féin,
                and they are permitting the denigration and demeaning of every
                symbol, flag and insignia of the majority’s British, political
                and national identity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is all made possible by the British fear
                of a resumption of mainland violence and the retention by Sinn
                Féin/IRA of its weaponry. Even post-11<sup> </sup>September
                2001, the British Government stay in cowardly concession mode,
                despite the fact that the United States’s attitude to
                terrorism would have made any immediate resumption of mainland
                violence by the IRA improbable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Current proposals for granting amnesty to
                criminals on the run bear witness to the continuance of this
                sickening appeasement. The British Government have been able to
                pursue a policy of endless concessions to Sinn Féin/IRA by the
                abject failure of David Trimble and his party to support other
                pro-Union parties in excluding Sinn Féin from the democratic
                process while it remains inextricably linked to armed and
                violent terrorists who retain the means of death and destruction
                and who, almost daily, engage in the most serious criminal acts
                of violence and intimidation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the reason for the Ulster Unionist
                Party’s behaviour? It is that Mr Trimble and his supporters on
                the institutional payroll are more dedicated to their personal
                and party interests than they are either to the democratic
                process or to the defence of the Union. The twists and turns of
                Mr Trimble and some of his political henchmen, such as Messrs
                Nesbitt and McGimpsey, are too numerous to detail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately for them and their party, as
                far as the electorate is concerned, they are becoming like
                President Clinton, whom one Washington journalist described as
                having no one left to lie to. They are discovering that the
                pro-Union people now recognise that they have been conned and
                that Northern Ireland is, indeed, a cold place for Unionists. It
                is a cold place because Sinn Féin/IRA has the weapons that
                frighten Mr Blair and his Government into turning the heat down
                by an endless stream of concessions to Republicanism. Indeed, so
                gutless are Mr Blair and his political gofer John Reid that the
                latter is inviting Sinn Féin/IRA and the Irish Government to
                give Unionists a little heat — perhaps in case Unionists
                decide that Northern Ireland has become so cold and that heat is
                so necessary for their survival that they begin to warm
                themselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does Sinn Féin, that regurgitates the worn
                out mantra that it is entitled to be here on the basis of its
                mandate, not realise that since Adolf Hitler’s thugs received
                the judgement at Nuremberg, parties can no longer claim to have
                a mandate to murder, maim and destroy on that basis? They can no
                longer claim, as Mr Milosevic is discovering, that acts of
                violent political terrorism can receive the absolution of an
                electoral mandate. Nor can Sinn Féin/IRA be allowed the
                protection of a military ceasefire to justify acts of civil
                murder, violence and intimidation against those whom it decides
                to punish. Indeed, nothing is more despicable than Prime
                Minister Blair’s failure to honour the pledges on beatings and
                intimidation which he gave not only to the pro-Union people, but
                to those living in Nationalist areas whom Republican terrorists
                continue to prey upon and attack.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Democracy and its institutions cannot coexist
                with terrorism, and what is appalling in democratic terms is the
                position of the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists. They seem to
                think that terrorism can, indeed, live side by side with
                democracy. Democrats cannot negotiate on an equal basis with
                those who can threaten violence and who retain the means to make
                good those threats. Perhaps Mark Durkan, now in the elevated
                position of Deputy First Minister, did not realise the full
                import of his remarks in a recent debate when he revealed that
                senior British officials at Weston Park in effect contrasted the
                relevant political leverage of democrats such as the SDLP with
                that of Sinn Féin in four words — you have no guns. Now is
                the time when all democrats must remove Sinn Féin/IRA from the
                political scene until it, like the rest of us, has no guns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now I will mention the absent senior
                sycophant Dermot Nesbitt. In this Chamber on 19 February he
                said:</p>

                words&quot;. If anyone does not believe me, especially Mr

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well I have read the ‘Belfast Telegraph’,
                and there is not one single word about decommissioning and not

                two letters and six phone calls Mr Nesbitt replied that the
                weight of his onerous duties of office prevented him from
                responding.</p>

                of the turns, twists, deceit, duplicity and utter cowardice of
                an Ulster Unionist Party that has deceived and conned the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. That vote
                shows overwhelming approval for the exclusion of IRA/Sinn Féin,
                and it shows that a clear majority of Unionists in the House are
                in favour of that. Will you ensure that that is brought to the
                attention, not only of the Secretary of State, but also of the
                Prime Minister? He pledged that if the mechanisms of this
                Assembly did not prove adequate for removing IRA/Sinn Féin, he
                would take action. Will you ensure that that is drawn to his
                attention so that he fulfils the pledge he made to the people of
                Northern Ireland before the referendum?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do, as a matter of course, bring to the
                attention of any Ministers motions that relate specifically in
                their terms to the Ministers involved. This motion relates to
                responsibilities within the Assembly, not to what the Prime
                Minister might do. It would be inappropriate for me to take that
                action. I have no doubt that there are Members here who are
                fully equipped to do what the Member suggests. That is the
                proper course of action, rather than for me as Speaker to
                address the matter.</p>
