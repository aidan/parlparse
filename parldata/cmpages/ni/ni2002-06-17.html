                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I would
                appreciate your clarification and help on a matter of procedure.
                The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Ms de
                Brún, presented the document ‘Developing Better Services’,
                about modernising the hospital service, on Wednesday 12 June at
                a press conference in the Odyssey Arena. I would have thought
                that it should have been presented to the Assembly first — at
                least by way of a statement — rather than outside. There is no
                precedent for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was a discourtesy that the Minister did
                not come to the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety beforehand and give it information about the document.
                The Department’s permanent secretary most certainly did on
                Tuesday and Wednesday, the day of the presentation. I am not
                aware of any case in which such an important ministerial
                document — in reply to the Hayes Report, and concerning all
                the people of Northern Ireland — has not been presented to the
                Assembly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have written to the Minister this morning
                saying that it would be a proper courtesy to the House for a
                matter of that kind to come forward in the normal way, as a
                statement. It remains for the Minister to respond. I was
                disappointed that on a matter of such importance the normal
                procedure was not followed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is aware that there are other ways
                in which he, as Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety, or another Member, may bring the
                matter to the Floor of the House.</p>

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In moving the motion, I shall briefly draw
              attention to a few points. The debate follows the Bill’s First
              Stage on Tuesday 11 June and the Supply resolution for the 2002-03
              Main Estimates, which was also considered and approved last week.
              The Bill can be given accelerated passage because the Committee
              for Finance and Personnel has confirmed that, in line with
              Standing Order 40, it is satisfied that there has been appropriate
              consultation on the public expenditure proposals contained in the
              Bill. That condition has been met, and the confirmation was given
              in a letter dated 11 June from the Chairperson of the Committee
              for Finance and Personnel to the Speaker.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Committee’s assistance in the
              matter and, indeed, the work that it undertakes and the
              contribution that it makes on all matters concerning public
              expenditure and related procedural issues. The purpose of the Bill
              is to give legislative effect to the resource Estimates approved
              through the Supply resolution passed on Monday 10 June. In
              introducing that Supply resolution, I provided considerable detail
              about the figure work contained in the Estimates booklet.
              Therefore, I do not intend to delay today’s debate with
              unnecessary repetition of that detail. Members have received
              copies of the detailed Main Estimates booklet. Copies of the
              Budget (No. 2) Bill and the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum
              should also be available.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the benefit of Members, however, I wish to
              summarise briefly the main features of the Bill in accordance with
              the nature of the Second Stage debate envisaged under Standing
              Order 30. The principle of the Bill is to authorise the use of
              resources totalling £5,710,516,000 by Departments and the issue
              of £4,962,077,000 from the Northern Ireland Consolidated Fund in
              respect of the Main Estimates for 2002-03.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Members that the spending plans
              reflected in the Budget (No.2) Bill were approved and endorsed by
              the Assembly when the Budget for 2002-03 was approved last
              December. Today’s proceedings are an important step in putting
              in place our expenditure framework for the year 2002-03.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly has important responsibilities in
              this area, and I was most interested to hear the views of Members
              in last week’s useful debate. The nature of these debates means
              that they are wide-ranging; that is important, because financial
              provision is fundamental to every one of our public services, and
              I welcome the interest that Members take in those matters.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are now becoming more familiar with the
              various stages of the budgetary processes. In that context, the
              Assembly has made considerable progress. In addition to coming to
              terms with many complex issues and processes, it has had to cope
              with making the transition from cash to resource accounting. The
              Assembly has important responsibilities for public expenditure,
              authorisation and control, and it has demonstrated considerable
              interest and diligence in addressing those responsibilities.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Department of Finance and Personnel’s
              officials for their work in bringing the Bill to Second Stage. As
              I have already said in the House, the Bill is an indication of how
              successful the Assembly has been in organising and administering
              its finances. As we approach the end of the Bill’s process, will
              the Minister look ahead to the reinvestment and reform initiative,
              which was initially introduced by his predecessor, Mark Durkan,
              and worked on more recently by the First Minister and the Deputy
              First Minister? Will he consider whether some money can be spent
              on roads in my constituency of South Down? Some hope and
              opportunity must be offered to provide improvements to its woeful
              road infrastructure. There is not one inch of dual carriageway in
              the constituency. Moreover, no major road schemes have ever been
              undertaken there, and no significant money has been spent on
              roads. Accessibility to the area is neglected and must be improved
              for the constituency’s growing tourist trade and its other
              services and needs.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was a briefer debate than I had
              anticipated, notwithstanding the fact that Members have addressed
              the issues on several occasions. I thank Mr ONeill for his
              contribution. The Department of Finance and Personnel is embarking
              on its preparation of the 2002 Budget. The Executive’s position
              report, which was recently presented to the Assembly, is
              available. It is hoped that Members will take the opportunity to
              put forward their views at pre-consultation stage. Those views are
              influential in shaping the draft Budget, which the Department will
              introduce for consideration in September.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill has invited me to stray outside the
              limits of the particularities that surround the Budget (No.2 )
              Bill, but the Executive, officials in the Office of the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister and officials in the
              Department of Finance and Personnel are working on the first set
              of proposals that they want to see adopted and implemented with
              respect to the resources available through the reinvestment and
              reform initiative. I note the points that Mr ONeill made about his
              constituency, and I am sure that many of those concerns could be
              reflected by other Members. The reinvestment and reform initiative
              is intended to provide the Assembly with a greatly enhanced range
              of resources from which to draw from in order to make good the
              deficit in investment in infrastructure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not in a position to make any commitments
              on the Member’s concerns about roads in South Down: that is a
              matter for the Minister for Regional Development, who will
              undoubtedly bring forward suggestions with respect to how the
              resources available to us under the reinvestment and reform
              initiative can be allocated to meet needs such as those that the
              Member has identified.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The roads in South Down are part of the range
              of considerations that are in the Minister for Regional
              Development’s mind. The reinvestment and reform package will
              enable us to address many other aspects of our infrastructure that
              are suffering from the deficit that we are all well aware of. I
              thank Mr ONeill for raising the point, and I thank him for his
              complimentary remarks. I seek the House’s support for the Second
              Stage of the Budget (No.2) Bill.</p>

              Department of the Environment provides for district councils in
              the form of the general grant.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two elements of grant: the derating
              element to compensate district councils for loss of rate income
              due to the statutory derating of certain properties; and the
              resources element to provide additional finance to those district
              councils whose total rateable value per head of population falls
              below a standard determined by the Department. The amount of grant
              available in the current financial year is £27·9 million for the
              derating element and £19·5 million for the resources element.
              That is a total of £47·4 million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The funds are distributed to councils in
              accordance with a statutory formula, which is detailed in the
              Local Government &amp;c. (Northern Ireland) Order 1972. The
              primary legislation requires, as part of the methodology of the
              distribution of the resources element, that the Department set a
              standard rate each year. Any council that falls below that level
              is entitled to a share of the grant, but those councils above the
              standard do not qualify. To determine the rate, data for selected
              district councils relating to gross penny rate products and
              population are applied. The formula is extremely complicated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The legislation also requires that the councils
              taken into account in the calculation of the standard rate be
              specified in an Order subject to affirmative resolution. Article 2
              of the Order lists the 14 councils for which data were used to
              determine the standard rate for distribution of this year’s
              provision of £19·5 million. The approval of the Order is a
              necessary part of the methodology for distribution of the
              resources element of the general grant for 2002-03. I commend it
              to the Assembly.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for the
              Environment (Rev Dr William McCrea):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. This is a very important
              Statutory Rule that is needed each year to specify those councils
              that will be used in calculating standard penny rate product,
              which is an essential component of the formula used to distribute
              the resources element of the general grant.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister is aware of the Committee for the
              Environment’s ongoing scrutiny of the Local Government
              (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which aims to put a new
              methodology in place for the distribution of the resources element
              in the general grant payable to district councils. The Committee
              is in discussion with the Department on clauses that relate to the
              general grant, and several amendments are being considered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is concerned about the projected
              reduction of the general grant from £20 million to £13·3
              million for 2003-04. I have already drawn that issue to the
              attention of Members, and I assure the Minister that my Committee
              will not allow this injustice to occur — and I use the word
              &quot;injustice&quot; deliberately, but that is a debate for
              another occasion. Although this Statutory Rule will play a part in
              future calculations of the grant, the Committee has no objection
              to it’s being made. I support the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not have much to say, but I am concerned
              about an issue that the Chairperson of the Committee for the
              Environment has already referred to; that is the disquiet that
              councils feel about the general grant and its operation. There is
              a genuine feeling of injustice. It is an archaic way to provide
              support for councils. Perhaps after the Committee and the
              Department have considered the issue, the result may be a fairer
              and more efficient method that will cause people fewer concerns
              and dispel any sense of injustice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even before devolution I was worried about the
              general grant. It has been eroded gradually to such an extent that
              some councils, including small councils such as Down District
              Council, have had an enormous budgetary battle to stay solvent and
              keep within the bounds of reasonable financial control. Can the
              Minister tell us how the community sector worked within the
              administration of the general grant allocation? Consideration was
              to have been given to how communities were divided, how they were
              made up, and what overall effect that had. However, he may not be
              in a position to give us that information.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlike Dr Farren, I am pleasantly surprised
              that there have been so few comments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Chairperson of the Committee for
              the Environment for his support for the motion and the necessity
              of the resources element. I wish to put on record that since I
              have become Minister of the Environment, Dr McCrea and I, although
              we come from different positions, have worked in a professional
              way; I commend the Chairperson for that. He referred to the new
              methodology that the Committee and the Department of the
              Environment are discussing. I repeat what I said on that topic: if
              the Committee or others have concerns, I seek constructive
              criticism from them — namely, that when they disagree with
              certain elements they genuinely put forward other views on how
              those issues can be dealt with.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McCrea also mentioned that the resources
              element of the general grant has possibly gone down from £20
              million to £13·3 million; that also concerns me. There is a
              problem with minima and with how the Department bids in the next
              round. I am conscious of how the Department has bid for resources
              and of how that bid may pan out. However, as the Chairman has
              rightly said, that is a debate for the future. I commend him for
              his words of support.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill referred to the injustice of the
              general grant and the disquiet that it has caused — perhaps
              echoing Dr McCrea’s fears that the general grant seems to have
              been reduced. Those concerns are raised when I meet with
              councillors.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill referred to the archaic method. I
              draw his attention to the new method that Dr McCrea referred to,
              which will be introduced in 2003. It will focus more on wealth and
              population indicators with adjustments that reflect the needs of
              the community, needs that are based on unemployment, tourism, and
              so on. I trust that the new method for dealing with the grant —
              when it is finally agreed upon — will empathise more with the
              community and will reflect its needs better than did the previous
              formula. I do not consider the new method to be archaic. I am not
              sure whether Mr ONeill wished me to explain the complicated method
              that is proposed today. It is more mechanical in relation to
              statistics, standard rates and average rates.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that I have covered that aspect. Mr
              ONeill asked me how communities were dealt with in the workings of
              the grant. The difficulty was that communities, as such, were not
              dealt with. The grant was worked out by dividing the rate poundage
              by the population of Northern Ireland to get the average rate. The
              rate for each district council was examined. If a district council’s
              rate was below average, it was entitled to more money. If Members
              saw the number of councils that were below average, they would see
              that the amount of money needed this year — based on the
              Northern Ireland average — is £23 million. The Department has
              only £19·5 million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, the Department must undertake a
              mathematical process to reach a figure that allows it to allocate
              the £19·5 million among 14 councils, which will be listed.
              However, that £19·5 million will only be shared among some of
              the 14. That complication in the calculation means that it may be
              viewed as archaic, in a sense. A new method is being devised and
              will be introduced. I believe that I have covered the points
              raised by the two Members.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Life is full of challenges, but the challenges
              faced by children with a severe learning or physical disability
              are often immense. How we provide for the needs, both immediate
              and long-term, of those children who require additional help,
              especially as they make the strenuous transition into early
              adulthood, is a measure against which we should be judged. Surely,
              they too should have the equal rights and equal opportunity to
              achieve their full potential.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In schools for those with severe learning
              disabilities, the transition stage begins at 14 and continues
              until pupils leave school at 19. For many young people with a
              severe learning disability, that transition stage is particularly
              traumatic given the changes that accompany leaving school and the
              preparations necessary for them. At that age, the options
              available are either placement in an adult day-care centre, a
              specialised course at a college of further education, employment
              or staying at home.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the numbers leaving special schools
              each summer are not large — 74 in 1998; 84 in 1999; 79 in 2000,
              and 84 in 2001 across all board areas — day-care services have
              become stretched in some areas. Saturation point has been reached,
              and no more places are available. Parents in my Mid Ulster
              constituency have been told that their children must remain at
              home until the waiting list there can be addressed. Mid Ulster is
              not alone in that. Parents in South Antrim are facing a similar
              dilemma.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely with the involvement of social services
              in transition plans from age 14, the shortfall in local day-care
              places should have been detected much earlier. Appropriate
              measures should have been taken to avoid what is now a calamity
              for many parents, who have every right to fear that any benefits
              and skills that their children accrued at school will be lost
              unless effective adult services become immediately available. The
              situation that they face cannot be put on the long finger.
              Although I want to develop longer-term issues, the motion deals
              directly with a situation that is immediate and a dilemma that
              many parents are facing.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More recently, in ‘Ignored or Ineligible?’,
              a survey conducted last year by the National Autistic Society, it
              was reported that the Government policy of inclusion in the
              education system raises expectations which are shattered in
              adulthood, as current provision is woefully inadequate:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The crucial years of transition can mean
              the difference between an unhappy and dependent existence in
              adulthood, or a more independent and fulfilled life.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In seeking adequate and appropriate provision
              for their children, parents are looking not for an adult crèche
              but for consistent and continuous curricular provision, so that
              the excellent work already delivered by the professional and
              dedicated teaching staff at special schools can continue. Is not
              the mission statement of the Northern Health and Social Services
              Board &quot;Promoting Health and Securing Care&quot;?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The help and teaching available to these
              children from birth are second to none. I pay genuine tribute to
              the professional support staff, social workers, psychologists,
              occupational therapists and special-needs teachers who have such a
              positive impact on young lives. How sad it will be, therefore, if
              all their efforts over the years are washed away because further
              facilities are unavailable when school-leaving age is reached.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely society owes these young people a chance
              to lead a fulfilling life, during which they can achieve many of
              the things that we, as able-bodied people, often take for granted.
              Instead, it appears that some are simply tossed aside — too
              unimportant to be considered for future advancement when people in
              mainstream education are actively encouraged to take up
              opportunities now and throughout their lives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pressure on day-care services and post-school
              placements has been of primary concern to many in the special
              school sector. This issue should be viewed in the context not only
              of Mid Ulster, but of the Province as a whole.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thought it prudent to source opinion from
              special schools across Northern Ireland before this debate. The
              similarities in the 21 responses I received were striking. They
              all reported difficulties with appropriate provision and support.
              Among the main issues identified were: very late confirmation of
              placements for young people, with the added stress that that
              brings to their families; inappropriate placements, or
              mismatching, where a school feels that placements have matched the
              provision available rather than a young person’s actual needs;
              an inability to guarantee full-time placements; a lack of more
              appropriate placements because of demand and the difficulties
              experienced by health and social services in moving people to
              alternative placements to release places for school-leavers; a
              breakdown in further education placements due to a lack of
              consistent and practical support; and a lack of alternative
              occupational provision for those unsuited to further education and
              for whom traditional day-care provision is inappropriate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The principal of Cranny Special School in Omagh
              told me that provision in that area is not encouraging and that,
              unless the situation is quickly resolved, two more students will
              leave at the end of December 2002 with no proper placements
              available.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The principal of Sandelford Special School in
              Coleraine stated that the problems to which I have referred have
              become more pronounced over the last six or seven years. Many
              leavers have had to wait at home for a considerable time before,
              in most circumstances, being offered one or two days’ placement
              a week because the local day-care centres are either full to
              capacity or understaffed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Riverside Special School in Antrim noted that
              if a young person does not get a place at an adult centre, he and
              his family are often isolated from the rest of the community and
              that a parent may have to contemplate seriously giving up work and
              rely solely on state benefits to support the family.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The principal of Jordanstown Special School in
              Newtownabbey stated that there is a need to ensure that proper
              provision is made for young people so that they are challenged and
              stimulated and continue to develop their skills.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The principal of Loughan Special School in
              Ballymena stated that something must be done about the appalling
              lack of provision for people over the age of 19 who have learning
              difficulties. That sentiment was reiterated by Knockevin Special
              School in Downpatrick, where support was expressed for a review
              into the funding arrangements for post-school placements for all
              those with learning difficulties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the end of June, many parents will be faced
              with the need to provide care, occupation, training and
              entertainment for their son or daughter, twenty-four hours a day,
              seven days a week. Holiday periods are especially difficult for
              children who require additional learning time and support and for
              those who need a set routine to continue to make good progress
              over the summer recess. The Assembly must assess the damage that
              will be done to individuals if, come September, placements cannot
              be found.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the areas where increased pressures are most
              evident, immediate measures must be taken to ensure that this
              summer’s leavers can make the transition to the post-school
              world seamlessly. Provision for children who leave special schools
              will continue to be an ever-increasing problem unless it is
              addressed at the highest level and long-term strategies are
              deployed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The parent of a child at Kilronan Special
              School in Magherafelt wrote to me and said that</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;in a society where moral and social
              values are rapidly deteriorating, please consider just how

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I received that letter because of the problems
              experienced by children who leave Kilronan Special School in
              Magherafelt at 19 years of age. Many parents are angry and
              frustrated because no one seems to acknowledge their plight and
              because, although the children that they love with all their
              hearts face a very uncertain future, no one seems to understand
              the pain that they suffer. I pay tribute to the parents of those
              very special children. However, although we agree that they are
              special, it is about time society provided for them. As I said
              earlier, the motion deals with a particular situation: children
              face a dilemma, and their parents face a nightmare. However, the
              motion itself is not the answer.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Able-bodied children are encouraged to fill
              their potential through continued education. That education could
              continue until a person is 30 years of age, because people are
              encouraged to go to university. However, for disabled children,
              education ends at 19 years of age, and that ought not to be the
              case. I have spoken to the Minister for Employment and Learning,
              Ms Carmel Hanna, about this and I headed a delegation that met
              her. Departments must work together to ensure adequate provision,
              and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety
              and the Department for Employment and Learning have vital roles to
              play. Why should education for these children finish when they
              reach the age of 19, given that other children are able to
              continue with theirs?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Adequate provision is vital because when these
              children reach the age of 19, they are put into adult centres.
              That is inappropriate but welcome, because there is no other
              provision. However, those placements are inadequate, and places
              ought to be provided for disabled people between the ages of 19
              and 35. Society is not doing that, and it should. Adult centres
              are suitable at a later stage in life, but not at 19 years of age.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Assembly to offer genuine care, and I
              pay tribute to those who have drawn this matter to my attention.
              Whether the child is Mary’s, Teresa’s or Peter’s, I say to
              those about whom I am concerned that the Assembly owes it to them
              to make this provision. At the end of this month those parents
              should know that their children will not be cast aside, that their
              rights will be acknowledged and that a place, albeit inadequate,
              will be found for them. They may not receive perfect provision,
              but they will receive good provision. These children are being
              discriminated against. Every other child is encouraged to continue
              with his education, but at 19 years of age disabled people are
              told that their education is over. These parents and children are
              doubly discriminated against because they are told that there is
              no provision for them and that the children must be kept at home.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Assembly to support the motion
              wholeheartedly. Justice will be done if we ensure that these
              children receive adequate provision.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety (Dr Hendron):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to congratulate the Dr McCrea for
              tabling this important motion. Learning difficulty is more common
              in Northern Ireland than in Great Britain; indeed, approximately
              8,000 people here have a severe learning disability, and
              approximately 35 children out of 1,000 under the age of 16 are
              disabled. People with a learning disability have the same right as
              non-disabled people to lead their lives as independently as
              possible. A key priority for the Department of Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety in the Programme for Government is
              described in the section ‘Working for a Healthier People’.
              That focuses on helping disabled people to achieve the highest
              possible standards of living and to be integrated fully into
              society, which is a worthy aim. However, evidence points to wide
              gaps in the provision of services for the learning disabled, with
              disparities in expenditure between different areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety recently met with the Kilronan Parents’ Action
              Group —I know that Dr McCrea is familiar with that group — as
              well as with the Foyle View Parents’ Support Group. The
              Committee learnt of the chronic lack of support for young people
              with special needs. Problems connected with a lack of respite care
              provision, especially in rural communities, were described.
              Transport to and from special schools and, crucially, a lack of
              suitable after-school places were also mentioned. Due to the
              limited options available, parents are often faced with providing
              24-hour care for their children. That can mean that they must
              leave employment, which can lead to stress and severe health
              problems for the carers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Foyle View Parent’s Support Group advised
              the Health Committee that parents in Belfast receive provision of
              £73 for each child compared to £53 for each child in Derry.
              Post-19 education services for people with learning disabilities
              are chronically underfunded. There is little available by way of
              training and social-care provision. The three existing adult
              centres in the Homefirst Trust area are already operating at 30%
              over capacity, and the trust cannot build more centres without
              additional funding.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the age of 19, these vulnerable young people
              are faced with the complete withdrawal of educational input. That
              means a lack of mental stimulation and loss of skills, which can
              lead to isolation, behavioural difficulties and depression. These
              young people must be able to build relationships with others in
              their age group and develop their full potential. Many of the
              children attending special schools are quite skilled and can excel
              in different areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a cross-cutting issue for health and
              education, as Dr McCrea pointed out, and it needs to be addressed
              urgently. Children with special needs are very limited in their
              life choices. At 19 their lives should be just beginning, but they
              face a poor quality future. That is clearly an equality issue. The
              Human Rights Act 1998 provides an additional focus on the rights
              and freedoms of individuals guaranteed under the European
              Convention on Human Rights, which includes the right to education.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Legislation must ensure provision for day care
              for young adults with disabilities. The Executive must demonstrate
              a clear commitment to targeting social need by directing resources
              equitably to ensure that this most vulnerable group is provided
              with the same opportunities and encouragement to develop as
              children in mainstream schools.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a Province-wide problem, but I am
              acutely aware of difficulties in my constituency of South Antrim,
              where I have been pursuing the interests of Riverside Special
              School. The school has a high reputation but cannot send its
              pupils, on leaving, to the local day centre because it has advised
              in advance that it will be unable to admit them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In February I asked the Minister of Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety if she agreed that all young
              people leaving special education should be entitled to a full-time
              place at an adult facility or day centre so that they can continue
              to avail of the opportunities created for them at a special
              school. The Minister’s reply, like that given to my Alliance
              Colleague in South Antrim, Mr Ford, contained a high degree of
              detail about procedures in place between the Departments of Health
              and Education. Those procedures were so complicated that they
              might have been specifically designed to fudge the question of who
              has responsibility for this.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Children who attend special schools have severe
              learning difficulties, and some have additional complications
              brought about through sensory or physical impairments. The main
              goal of the curriculum designed for them is to give them
              independence in their adult life. In mainstream education each
              child has his talents, strengths and weaknesses. So too, have the
              children who attend special schools, except that these children
              also have physical and mental needs that vary from child to child.
              There are different implications for each child, depending on his
              individual needs and ability.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That can present problems when these young
              people attain school-leaving age and are forced to leave the
              secure cocoon provided for them during their formative years. Some
              are able to pursue further education by attending a further
              education college, backed up by a work placement. That option is a
              positive step for those whose disabilities are not too serious.
              Others are not so fortunate. Sensory and physical impairments
              restrict their passage into the adult world and an independent
              life, and the options available to them are severely limited.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Attendance at an adult centre is usually the
              most appropriate option for them, but places are limited or, as in
              my constituency, non-existent. At the beginning of June, the local
              adult centre in Antrim closed to school leavers. The centre is
              oversubscribed, and the implications for young people and their
              families are serious, to say the least. Denied a place at an adult
              centre, they will find themselves plunged into isolation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McCrea was spot on when he said that some
              families have no option but to give up work and rely on state
              benefits. Families’ incomes can be reduced suddenly and
              drastically, affecting all members of the household.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even if a young person obtains a place at an
              adult centre, there are problems ahead. The 10 or 12 years spent
              at a special school will have been carefully planned and tailored
              to suit an individual’s special needs, including interaction
              with students of similar ages. However, once a person has been
              allocated a place at an adult centre, there is every possibility
              that he will stay there for the rest of his life, which could be
              50 years. The variety of stimulation provided by such an
              environment is bound to be very limited.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyone leaving special education should be
              entitled to a full-time place at an adult day centre to continue
              to pursue the opportunities created for him at school. How can the
              teachers who educate these young people have any job satisfaction,
              knowing that the benefit of their efforts will come to an abrupt
              end when the children leave school? How can we encourage new
              teachers with a penchant for teaching children with special needs
              to enter the profession? That is a real problem. How can the
              families of children with special needs hope to achieve any
              quality of life, for their children or themselves?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These serious matters must be addressed now. If
              anyone is in any doubt about that, he should visit Riverside
              Special School in Antrim — I encourage members of the Committee
              for Health, Social Services and Public Safety to do so. They will
              see the young adults there, the special facilities that are
              provided for them, the special care that they receive and the
              expertise of the staff. When they leave, they should ask
              themselves whether those young adults are ready to leave, without
              further provision being made for their care. I support the motion.</p>

              our community — young people and adults with learning
              disabilities. I also commend William McCrea for tabling the
              motion, for drawing attention to this essential area and for
              collating the views of the principals of schools such as Cranny
              Special School in Omagh and similar schools in Magherafelt, Antrim
              and other places.</p>

              a mother from the Dromore area of County Tyrone who recently
              lobbied me on her situation. I can testify to the parental anxiety
              and trauma, having listened to her account. Parents are struggling
              to meet the needs of children with learning disabilities, and they
              dread their sons or daughters turning 19 and having to face the
              next stage of their lives with minimal or no provision. Often,
              they learn only at a very late stage whether their child has
              secured a place at a day centre.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even when someone is allocated a place at a day
              centre, the arrangements are often not suitable. Facilities can be
              overcrowded, young women and older men can be catered for
              together, and there can be minimal stimulation — the point has
              been made already that everyone has right to a meaningful and

              disabilities.</p>

              the past. We should be looking at long-term planning and a
              joined-up approach by the various agencies and Departments, not
              least the Department of Education and the Department of Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety has said that the boards have been given additional
              money in the recent past to deal with community services such as
              this. There are certainly issues here for the boards and the
              trusts. With reference to the Sperrin Lakeland Health Trust, I
              want to pay tribute to individuals such as Mr Ciaran Downey and Mr
              Liam McDermott, who do a great job in difficult circumstances to
              provide this care. They need more money to do the work that they
              have been charged to do.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Support for carers and parents is crucial.
              Often parents need respite urgently, and Dr Hendron adequately
              covered the area of stress on parents and the debilitating effect
              it has on the carers who are essentially charged with a huge task.
              They are often stressed out and at the end of their tether, and
              there is a cry for urgent help and attention. We need to invest in
              our carers and the parents involved, because they are the key
              delivery mechanism of the help at the end of the day. More focus
              and greater resources are required. Mr Jim Wilson spoke well when
              suggesting areas of work that the Committee for Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety might wish to undertake. I am sure that
              that Committee has a heavy workload, but this appears to me to be
              an ideal subject for a Committee inquiry. Perhaps Dr Hendron and
              the Committee members would consider that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are all challenged to look at the priority
              that we give to the issue. Should this area of health provision
              come before the Executive in the future for Executive programme
              funds and extra funding, the other Ministers would need to give
              the necessary support. In conclusion, a LeasCheann Comhairle, I
              agree that society must not leave young people with learning
              difficulties behind. We should work hard on the matter, and there
              should be a joined-up and thoughtful approach taken by everyone.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Rev Dr William McCrea for bringing this
              very important subject to the Floor of the House. When I say
              &quot;very important&quot; I mean very important, because I am
              speaking as a parent of a daughter with severe learning
              difficulties, who has gone through exactly what we are talking
              about today. My family and I know only too well the stresses and
              strains involved. As we go through life, we must ensure that every
              effort is made to get the best educational and health provision
              for people such as my daughter. I must tell the Assembly of my
              sincere gratitude to all the service providers who up until now
              — over the past 30 years — have been with Joanne and my
              gratitude for the enormous educational and health provision that
              she has received. I hope that that can continue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Joanne attended Clifton Special Care School in
              Bangor, and when she reached the age of 19, I recall that our
              family was really concerned about her leaving that school. We
              wondered where she was going to go. That was the real concern, and
              that issue is what we are talking about today. We were almost at
              our wits’ end, because at that time there was very little
              available. I am thankful that both Departments came together to
              find a place in the local adult training centre. Joanne attends
              there five days a week, and she gets enormous satisfaction from
              being there. For families and parents, the provision is essential.
              No stone must be left unturned to ensure that the provision is
              available to every person in Northern Ireland who needs it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Members have spoken of the need for the
              Department of Education and the Department of Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety to come together to ensure that the
              provision is open to everyone. Every establishment in Northern
              Ireland is under extreme pressure, but, if sufficient funding is
              not available, the Assembly will have failed. I am sure that
              Members will agree that that is not an option.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Rev William McCrea for tabling the
              motion, and I thank the Members who have spoken. I just wanted to
              relay my experience of this very important subject as a parent. It
              is unbelievable not to know where one’s young son or daughter is
              to go at the age of 19. The Assembly must ensure that the
              provision is made. I support the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too support the motion, and I thank Rev
              William McCrea for bringing it to the House. The care of special
              school leavers is a frequently overlooked topic that is not given
              the attention it deserves. Disability is often the poor relation
              of the Health Service, and responsibility for the care of those
              with learning disabilities is often left to families or carers.
              That causes hardship for the carers, who could be perceived as the
              forgotten people. They work long hours, often under severe
              financial pressure and with little recognition for their valuable
              contribution to society and to the quality of life of the person
              with the learning disability.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A wide range of needs is currently not being
              met, and the situation will continue to deteriorate if something
              is not done immediately. The main reason for this is inadequate
              funding. Most trusts are severely underfunded; as a result, they
              are unable to provide adequate facilities and services that
              reflect the needs of people with learning difficulties. When I
              talk about services, I am referring to the whole range of
              services, including care workers, therapists and all other
              healthcare professionals working in the field. I have had reports
              of centres that have the facilities, but no resources for
              therapists to provide a service to their clients. Money that
              should be going to disability services has, all too often, been
              diverted to acute services, with the result that there has been a
              continual decline in facilities for the disabled.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many with learning disabilities depend on the
              services offered by day centres. It is often the only opportunity
              that they have for therapy, social contact and the security of a
              structured environment, which they need to promote proper
              development of their capabilities. Current provision is not
              sufficient to deal with demand, and that does not bode well for
              the future as more clients make the transition from the education
              system to adult support services. As many Members have said, we
              have seen in the past how many young people stay in the education
              system until the age of 19 and then move to the Department of
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the years, young people with learning
              difficulties have proved what they are capable of, and many have
              now been given the opportunity to move into employment, learning
              and training. Their needs have changed. Many Members, including
              Rev William McCrea, have mentioned the lack of facilities in their
              constituencies. Two weeks ago I raised the issue of the adult
              resource centre formerly known as the Wallace day centre. Members’
              contributions today only prove the need for a focused strategy on
              the services and facilities that should be offered to young people
              with learning difficulties across Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite the commitment of their excellent
              staff, many of these centres are not of an acceptable standard to
              cater for their clients’ needs. Many are overcrowded and, in
              some cases, because of the demand for services, can be offered
              only on a part-time basis for a few hours each day or even for
              just two to three days a week.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some older adults in my own day centre have
              been intimidated and told that as they have been there for 10
              years, they must now move over and take part-time places to allow
              new people to join. That puts further pressure on families and
              carers, many of whom are getting older and finding it difficult to
              cope. That has a serious effect on the morale of clients and their
              families, carers and staff.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People with learning difficulties already
              suffer considerable social disadvantage and, because of their
              inability to speak out for themselves, they rely on others to
              speak for them. They deserve a service tailored to their needs,
              and they should be secure in the knowledge that the service will
              continue if that is their choice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The facilities and services must be flexible
              enough to deal with people of different abilities. The staff who
              work in those centres must be given adequate resources and support
              to deliver those services. The right to choose is vital, and there
              should be choices available, both for those with learning
              disabilities and for their carers. It is important that there be
              facilitation to enable them to take control of their lives and to
              achieve a level of independence commensurate with their
              conditions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the social aspect. Every
              individual is a part of our community and, as such, has the right
              to the opportunity to develop a social network within that
              community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Accommodation in many day centres is under
              severe pressure, and we are heading towards a crisis situation.
              More young adults are leaving special schools and need the
              services of a day centre, and older clients are being moved out to
              make room for them. What is happening to the older clients, and
              where is their equality of treatment? Are their needs not just as
              important? The only solution is to ensure that adequate funding is
              ring-fenced for learning disability services, and facilities
              should be brought up to date to reflect the needs of the
              twenty-first century.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call on the Minister of Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety to bring together a working group with
              the Department of Education and the Department for Employment and
              Learning to create a strategy for people with learning
              difficulties, so that there is a clear and simple transition
              process for many of those young people and their families, carers
              and staff to give them the quality of life which is a basic human
              right.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend Dr McCrea for tabling the motion. We
              are talking about the less well off in so far as social and
              vocational interests are concerned.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate has been well rehearsed, and I
              commend Members for taking part. As a former social worker, I am
              aware of the great difficulty that arises when the learning
              disabled reach the age of 19. After that age, there is no place to
              go. That is sad for the individual and difficult for the carer.
              Respite is no longer available; stress occurs; the burden of care
              is further increased; and crisis projects itself tremendously.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, help may be available. Through some
              lobbying that I took part in, the Sperrin Lakeland Trust in
              Enniskillen has provided a new resource at Lackaboy, about a mile
              outside the town. It has proved very useful, and lots of people
              have taken advantage of it. Fermanagh College, in conjunction with
              the trust, has initiated a course of instruction on a
              two-day-a-week basis, mainly for the younger learning disabled.
              There is also a scheme initiated by a residential home in the
              area, known as the Strule/Erne project, based on day-care
              provision in Enniskillen. Other people can take advantage of such
              schemes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Day-care provision is essential to provide
              self-esteem and to make the learning disabled feel part of life in
              general. They are enthused by their work, and it is sad that it
              should be taken away from them at 19 years of age. I found from my
              experience in social work that carers needs a great deal of
              respite, and it is unfair to add to their burden.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and pay tribute to the
              carers, tutors, social work staff and all those involved in the
              tremendous work that they do.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I commend Mr Jim Wilson’s
              invitation to the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public
              Safety to pay a visit to his constituency. The experience will be
              enlightening. I support the motion.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Rev Dr William McCrea for tabling the
              motion. The issue is timely and must be discussed. There is little
              point in the House talking about existing problems unless action
              is taken to resolve them and to avert further hardship for the
              learning disabled.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members have said that they have close
              family members with learning disabilities. My eldest brother has
              had severe difficulties since shortly after birth. I mention that
              because it shows that learning disabilities transcend all sections
              of our society, whether one is Protestant or Catholic, Unionist or
              Nationalist, rich or poor. No one is omitted. Learning disability
              can touch any section of our society. In a recent Adjournment
              debate on people with learning disabilities, which was initiated
              by Ms Lewsley, I said that we could judge a society on how well it
              treats its most vulnerable people. What judgement will be cast on
              our society on how it treats its most vulnerable, in the form of
              the learning disabled?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my constituency, there is the Lisburn adult
              resource centre, Seymour Hill horticultural centre, the Beeches
              vocational training unit, the Stepping Stones outreach facility
              and Lisburn YMCA. Outside my constituency, but in the Lisburn
              Borough Council area, there is a unit at the Dairy Farm centre at
              Poleglass. Those centres provide for the area’s learning
              disabled.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who work with the learning disabled do
              their level best to provide a good facility. Unfortunately, it
              falls short of the real needs of the learning disabled in the
              area. Lisburn adult resource centre was built for 80 people, but
              it is being used by 101 people. The centre is not suitable. It has
              no automatic doors at its entrance for wheelchair users and has no
              covered area for young people alighting from buses. The site is
              not integrated, meaning that users of the centre have to go
              outside to reach another part of the building in all weather
              conditions, which is totally unsuitable. Too many people with
              varied behavioural abilities have to use the same room and receive
              the same service at the same time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another problem that must be addressed
              specifically is that Down Lisburn Trust has adopted a policy of
              putting the over-45s out of the resource centre to make way for
              the younger learning disabled. That is totally unfair. There are
              people in their early 40s who know that pressure will be put on
              them to leave the centre. Two groups of people will be
              traumatised. The first group are those who are leaving school to
              make their way to the centre or to one of the other resources in
              the area. They will wonder whether a place will be available for
              them. Their families will want to know what they will do when
              their children leave school. The second group are those in their
              early 40s who are worried that they will be put out of the centre
              to make way for the younger people. Society will not judge that as
              a good way to treat its most vulnerable people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are other opportunities. I know that some
              people have adopted the Canadian approach of developing a support
              network of carers and befrienders for the learning disabled who
              wish to stay at home with their families. I support the people who
              wish to do that. However, the majority of people do not wish to do
              that; they want their children to be able to attend the resource
              centre or another facility where they can mix with other people
              and have the opportunity to make friends. Those people should be
              facilitated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Employment and Learning must
              confront its responsibilities. In the past, European funding was
              reduced, and the Beeches lost the funding that previously was
              administered to it through that Department. Fortunately, the Down
              Lisburn Trust was able to take up the slack for this year and
              ensure that the Beeches stayed open. However, a significant
              learning and employment element is involved because many of the
              young people enter employment after they leave the Beeches. I do
              not accept that the Department for Employment and Learning does
              not have any responsibility to bear. Why should the learning
              disabled be treated any differently from anybody else if the work
              that they do at a centre will generate the opportunity for them to
              take up employment later on?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Employment and Learning has
              a responsibility from which it must not walk away. I trust that
              the departmental officials will read this debate, take on board
              what I have said and take responsibility for providing funding for
              the Beeches and other places that provide training for the
              learning disabled.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I pay special regard to the Stepping Stones
              outreach facility. It is a wonderful facility that gets young
              people involved in working in the community. That is a tremendous
              asset to the young people and to the businesses that employ them.
              It gives the young people an opportunity to work in the community
              and show what they can do.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agenda for the learning disabled must be
              driven forward, and Members must address the issues that are being
              brought before the House. All the Ministers involved must take
              their roles seriously. They must properly and adequately address
              the problems in those areas.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I
              congratulate Dr McCrea for tabling what is an important motion.
              Those Members who have met the parents of children in this
              invidious position know their pain and hurt, which are due to the
              lack of understanding from the statutory authorities. Anything
              that the Assembly can do to further projects that promote
              integration and social inclusion and redress the age-old prejudice
              and ignorance about learning disability will be welcomed. Anything
              that the Assembly can do to highlight the difficulties faced by
              those young people is welcomed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with and support the idea of a
              cohesive, collaborative approach between the Department of Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety and the Department for
              Employment and Learning. The care of special school leavers is
              both a health and an education issue. Primary, secondary and
              third-level education should be involved in attempting to work out
              support employment programmes that bridge the serious gap in
              society that fails to take account of the needs of the people that
              the motion addresses.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a grandnephew who is wheelchair-bound,
              and I know something about the difficulties that those young
              people face. They are intelligent young people who are aware of
              what is going on around them, yet they are dumped on the scrap
              heap, or sent to institutions or day-care centres to which they
              are not suited and where they get in the way. Members could
              sponsor a disabled person from their constituency and bring him to
              Parliament Buildings for one day a week for as long as they can.
              Members can take the lead and begin to integrate disabled people
              into this part of society and give them an opportunity to sit in
              our offices to see what Members do or to measure what is going on
              around them. That is something positive that Members could do as
              an indication of their concern for these young people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate William&nbsp;McCrea for tabling
              this important motion. We have listened to the other Members who
              have spoken, and I will not reiterate needlessly what they have
              said. I support the motion.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank William McCrea for giving us the
              opportunity to discuss this important issue. I regret that I was
              unable to be present for the start of the debate, but I was
              hosting a four-Ministers meeting here this morning with Alan
              Milburn, Malcolm Chisholm and Jane Hutt. However, officials
              monitored the details of the debate until my arrival, and I have
              learned a great deal from that and from what I have heard from
              Members today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The transition arrangements for young people
              leaving special schools are set out in section 5 of the Disabled
              Persons (Northern Ireland) Act 1989, which requires an education
              and library board to notify the responsible health and social
              services trust of the date on which full-time education will
              cease. The trust is then responsible for arranging an assessment
              of the young person’s needs and the provision of appropriate
              services. The code of practice for the identification and
              assessment of special educational needs published by the
              Department of Education in 1998 provides guidance on how the
              transitional planning should be arranged.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past 12 months, day-care places have
              been provided for 70 young people who have left special schools,
              but eight special school leavers have not had their day care needs
              met. Pressure on day care places is increasing, and waiting lists
              are beginning to emerge. The four health and social services
              boards have taken steps to address the pressures on local day care
              services and they plan to meet anticipated future need.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Young people with learning disabilities have a
              diverse range of abilities and disabilities that require tailored
              day-care placement. For those whose level of disability permits,
              the aim is to provide placements that develop skills and abilities
              that prepare young people for the working environment and support
              them in such environments. For those who are unable to access
              further education, vocational training schemes or supported
              employment scheme placements are offered in adult training centres
              or voluntary sector schemes that provide highly supported places.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some examples of innovative day care projects
              have been mentioned during the debate. The Bridge Association in
              Antrim runs a commercial garden centre that employs young people
              with learning disabilities. In Coleraine, young people with
              learning disabilities have the contract for the grounds
              maintenance at Coleraine Hospital and the Robinson Memorial
              Hospital. Others are involved in a recycling project.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots mentioned Stepping Stones, which is a
              Lisburn-based project that offers employment for young people in a
              commercial coffee shop. There is also a commercial baking and
              retail project called the Cookie Company. In Derry, the Lilliput
              Theatre Company is the only local theatre company that is made up
              of people with learning disabilities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Day care is provided for almost half of the
              8,500 people with learning disabilities who are in contact with
              the health and social services trusts. Day care is not provided on
              the basis of age but on the basis of need. Young people have
              access to adult training centre places, horticultural training
              schemes, voluntary sector projects offering arts and crafts
              training, further education courses and supported employment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regionally, there are 3,820 places providing
              day care for 4,120 people. Thirty people are not receiving any day
              care and are waiting for a place.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will outline the action being taken by
              individual boards to identify special school leavers in the coming
              years and to develop day-care services. In the Eastern Board an
              average of 50 young people a year will leave special schools in
              each of the next four to five years and will require some form of
              day support, although not necessarily a place in a statutory
              facility. Trusts adopt the person-centred approach, which has been
              mentioned, when discussing options with service users and their
              carers. Trusts co-operate with other statutory bodies in
              education, training and employment to develop a range of
              opportunities for those who can access them. They work with
              voluntary sector care providers to develop some of the locally
              based schemes that we have discussed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Northern Board area 154 young people
              will leave special schools in June 2002. The future planning for
              young people leaving schools there is also a shared responsibility
              of health and social services, education and training agencies.
              This year the board will make additional funding available to
              stimulate additional day-care capacity, which will include the
              development of small local schemes run by voluntary sector
              organisations. The board does not believe that there is a need for
              additional day-care facilities for children who have left school,
              as has been suggested. Facility-based day care is not necessarily
              considered appropriate for the needs of young people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Southern Board has recognised a need for a
              more diverse range of day opportunities based on a multi-agency
              approach. In that regard, it identified a need for day-care
              provision for an additional 20 people a year over the next five
              years, which includes six to seven young adults leaving special
              schools each year in each trust area. Several of them will have
              complex needs that will require day care five days a week. It is
              recognised that day care, providing activity and skills training,
              is vital to support people in the community. The board has
              identified enhanced day care as an area for development against
              any additional funding available this year. In the longer term,
              the emphasis on day-care provision will be to procure a diverse
              range of tailored schemes with several providers to meet the
              identified local need. Some of that work fits in with some of the
              points raised by Members.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Expenditure on learning disability services has
              increased from just under £89 million in 1998-99 to just over
              £100 million in 2000-01. An additional £191 million has been
              allocated to the four health and social services boards to develop
              community services, including those for people with a learning
              disability, so some of the money that has been allocated to
              develop community services in general will be available for the
              development of learning disability day-care services. Members have
              drawn attention to, and my Department is aware of, the growing
              demand for statutory day-care places as the number of more
              dependent young people who cannot access other day activities such
              as education, training or supported employment increases.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will set out my priorities for action for
              2002-03. Boards and trusts should continue to expand the provision
              of day care and respite places for people with a learning
              disability. The question of carers was mentioned in that regard,
              and my priorities for action in 2002-03 include provision of extra
              respite care places. Some of the additional funding, which I have
              allocated to the four health and social services boards to develop
              community services in 2002-03, will be available for the purpose
              of expanding the provision of day-care and respite places for
              people with a learning disability.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recently launched the report ‘A Fair Chance’,
              which records the views expressed by people with learning
              disabilities about the services they use and how they might better
              address the equality of opportunity issues that they face. The
              report has been widely distributed to health and social services
              and other Departments and their agencies. That will help to inform
              future service development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Day care is an essential element in the overall
              provision of care and support for young people with learning
              disabilities. However, as has been said today, it must be
              appropriate to the needs of the individual. In that regard,
              provision of appropriate day-care activities is a shared
              responsibility between several Departments and their agencies.
              That approach will enable those Departments to offer a choice of
              day-care activities that develop abilities and skills and meet
              personal aspirations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will welcome the fact that I am meeting
              Martin McGuinness and Carmel Hanna next month to discuss how our
              Departments and their agencies can use their expertise
              collectively to ensure that young people with learning
              disabilities have the same life opportunities as other young
              people. Young people with disabilities want to be able to do the
              same things that non-disabled young people enjoy. That is what
              social inclusion means. Our responsibility is to ensure that the
              services we provide help them to achieve that goal. I will work
              with my Executive Colleagues, the voluntary sector and the rest of
              the statutory sector to ensure that we remove the barriers to
              social inclusion and provide the best possible opportunities for
              people throughout the age range so that people with disabilities
              and those without disabilities can enjoy and engage in the same
              range of activities and meet their aspirations in the best way
              possible.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Members who have participated in
              the debate for their input and valued support. Comments made in
              the Chamber today will comfort families who felt that they had
              exhausted all hope and who are appealing to the Assembly to do
              something to help them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask Members to consider the motto of
              Roddensvale Special School in Larne, which concentrates on the
              three Ps — prepare, praise and progress. The debate has
              recognised the sterling work of special needs schools in preparing
              children who have learning disabilities to best meet the
              challenges that life will undoubtedly throw at them. The debate
              has also recognised the praise that is readily and freely given to
              those children not only by their parents and families but also by
              their teachers and professional staff in the Health Service. That
              leaves the third element, progress, which is a matter for the
              Assembly. That is why we are debating how best to make such
              progress.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree wholeheartedly with the Chairperson of
              the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety who
              said that there was an equality aspect of the right to education.
              The Minister said that she agreed with social inclusion and that
              each child, irrespective of whether he is disabled or able-bodied,
              should be able to engage in a range of activities and have the
              opportunity to meet his aspirations. Those are fine and laudable
              words, but it is important that the Executive help to ensure that
              money is provided to this most vulnerable group.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jim Wilson mentioned Riverside Special School.
              He also spoke about the effects that disability and lack of
              provision have on every member of a household. I agree
              wholeheartedly with his sentiment that options are available to
              young people with learning disabilities, but that they are
              limited. He referred to oversubscription of adult day care centres
              in Antrim, and he also mentioned the need for variety and
              stimulation. All those points are invaluable in meeting the needs
              of these children. The garden centre run by the Bridge Association
              in Antrim is a novel and beneficial project. I am sure that Mr
              Wilson will join me in commending the association on its excellent
              work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wilson said that this issue affects every
              Member of the House. That is true. One mother from Magherafelt who
              mentioned the situation to me is a single parent. If her son does
              not find a placement, she will have to leave her work, which is
              necessary to enable her to give the best to her child. She wants
              and needs to work to give her child every possible help while he
              is in her care, but she is unfortunately being forced into a
              situation in which she will have to leave work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If I could put into words the pain and anxiety
              that was on that mother’s face and on the faces of other parents
              who have joined me in delegations and deputations to board
              officers, trust officers and the Minister for Employment and
              Learning, Members would know that those parents want to give their
              children the very best. However, they believe that they will not
              get the best, that they will be discriminated against, because,
              when the school year finishes at the end of this month, they will
              sit at home. That is not in the interests of the children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All the development and effort that has been
              put in over years in the special schools, which is excellent, A1
              provision, will be wasted because many of those children have to
              take life one day at a time and, therefore, look forward to what
              is currently provided.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Barry McElduff mentioned a school in his area.
              A mother’s tears and a mother’s worry over her child are the
              same in West Tyrone as they are in Mid Ulster. A mother’s care,
              in Carrickmore, Magherafelt, Larne or Ballymena, transcends all
              sections of society, as my hon Friend, Mr Poots, said. It is
              imperative that we give children with special needs the help that
              is necessary.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kieran McCarthy highlighted his personal
              experience. I thank him for sharing with the House the situation
              that he and his family face with Joanne. I also thank Mr Poots for
              his personal contribution. No one can really understand except
              parents who have been there and carried that burden in their
              hearts. I thank Members for sharing their personal situations. It
              takes courage. I am sure that many times, like the parents that I
              am speaking of, they too were at their wits’ end, not knowing
              exactly what the next step would mean.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Wilson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did the Member hear anything in the Minister’s
              response that gives any hope at all to the parents who have
              approached him and me, in Antrim and elsewhere, about the future
              for their children?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I tried to take in some of the figures that the
              Minister mentioned. The Minister was recently given a 37% rise in
              financial allocations, 13% of which was for learning disabilities.
              That does not augur well, because it is inappropriate and unequal.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This issue transcends everyone and all sections
              of the community. I am endeavouring to ensure that, at the end of
              this debate, action can be taken that will ensure that anyone with
              learning disabilities who is not allocated a place will be assured
              of and given a place. People have a right to demand that. Parents
              have a right to demand that their children be treated equally with
              all other children who have learning disabilities.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The very heart of our motion, and our reason
              for tabling it, is that this is not happening. I do not care how
              heaven and earth might be moved to provide places, but it is
              imperative that funding be allocated to ensure them. A meeting
              with officers of the Northern Health and Social Services Board has
              ensured that an additional £140,000 has been allocated
              specifically for investment in day care. I shall watch with
              interest how that money is used in that board’s area. Parents
              are crying out for places for their children, and that money could
              provide them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy said that Joanne is provided for,
              and we rejoice in that. However, the burden of the debate is that
              not everyone with equal need is accommodated. Patricia Lewsley
              said that responsibility is left to families, and on many
              occasions that is correct. Those parents have been told that when
              their child reaches the age of 19 it is over to them — there is
              no provision. Even the special provision during the summer has
              been taken from them. The door is closed, and parents are left
              with their children at home.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential that there is provision for
              everyone and that families are not left to meet their own needs.
              There is a problem of resources, but the Assembly must provide
              those and ring-fence them. A clear, concise strategy must be
              created which makes definite provision for those children. Mr
              Poots said that society is judged by how the most vulnerable are
              treated. How will we be judged? After the debate, we will be
              judged on how we provide for those people. There are so many
              things to consider. We tell many of these children that their
              education is finished at the age of seven or nine. Is any other
              child told that? Many 19-year-olds have the mental capacity of a
              seven- or nine-year-old, and sometimes in saying that I am pushing
              it. People see the body of an adult, but they do not see the
              child. When all the speeches are made and the verbiage is over, we
              tell those children that their right to education ceases at the
              age of seven or nine. We hand them over to their parents and
              provide nothing for them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A strategy for proper provision between the
              ages of 19 and 35 is necessary. Those children have a right to
              achieve their ultimate potential. However, the parents who asked
              me to propose the motion do not even reach for that. They want
              their children to have the right to care in an adult centre. It is
              not the ultimate in provision, but they have a right to it. I
              agree wholeheartedly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I need add no more. We will be judged, as Jim
              Wilson said, on what we do after the final word has been spoken. I
              trust that the Assembly will support the motion.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">asked the Minister of Education whether he will
              agree to provide resources for extra security for the schools that
              have been attacked in the recent spate of sectarian violence; and
              to make a statement.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Education (Mr M McGuinness): </b>I
              deplore and condemn the recent spate of attacks on schools and ask
              those responsible to stop immediately. The attacks serve no
              purpose and mean that scarce financial resources in the education
              sector must be diverted from the classroom to meet the cost of
              repairs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received reports on each of the schools
              that was attacked, and I pay tribute to the efforts of all those
              who have worked to ensure that, in so far as possible, the pupils
              in their care have not suffered and that disruption to the schools’
              work has been kept to a minimum. I highlight the work of teaching
              and non-teaching staff, parents, education and library board staff
              and officers from the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS)
              especially for the way in which they have managed to get the
              schools functioning again as quickly as possible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past five years, the Department has made
              an additional £5 million available, specifically to address basic
              security measures in schools. A further £1 million has been made
              available this year, and Members will be aware of the additional
              funding package that was made available earlier this year to deal
              with the problems in north Belfast. However, the Department’s
              resources are limited, and it has no additional resources for
              further security measures at the schools that were attacked
              recently.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cost of repairs associated with vandalism
              is usually met from the budget delegated to each school. However,
              education and library boards have arrangements to consider what
              assistance, if any, can be given from available resources to
              controlled and maintained schools in cases in which the costs of
              vandalism are excessive. Similar arrangements apply between the
              Department and the voluntary grammar and grant-maintained
              integrated schools.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge the steps that the education and
              library boards and schools have taken to reduce levels of
              vandalism, but we must accept that there are limits to what can be
              done. We cannot completely secure all school premises without
              their becoming fortresses. I call on all public representatives
              and members of the community who are in positions of authority to
              make it clear that attacks on schools are unacceptable and must
              stop.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am absolutely astounded that no financial
              resources are available for those schools. I remind the Minister
              that the schools were the victims of arson attacks, not vandalism.
              If the Minister does not provide principals with extra funding for
              the private security firms that they have employed to cover the
              July period, they will have to pay out a considerable amount of
              money from their school budgets. Given that the Minister’s plans
              may provide only a short-term solution, what does he intend to do
              in the longer term? Will he consider employing detached youth
              workers and more community workers to build better community
              relations, especially in south Belfast?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A working group of officials, staff from the
              education and library boards and the CCMS compiled guidance on
              school security in 1997 and issued a booklet entitled ‘Security
              and Personal Safety in Schools’ to all schools. The Department
              is making substantial bids for additional resources under both the
              Executive’s reinvestment and reform initiative and the 2002
              spending review to meet various pressures across the education
              service. They include a bid for additional capital funds to enable
              the Department and the boards to respond to requests from schools
              for increased security measures.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members know, and Ms McWilliams is correct to
              say it, that we have, in the course of the past few years, seen a
              situation develop in which people in our society think that it is
              sensible to burn schools and attack chapels, churches and Orange
              halls. All those attacks are inexcusable and unacceptable, and it
              is the responsibility of elected representatives and community
              leaders to be at the forefront of making it clear how unacceptable
              such attacks are. I hope that people will recognise that the
              Department’s resources are limited.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department always intends to put as much
              money as possible into classrooms and schools to benefit children.
              We all know that unless that behaviour is ended as a matter of
              urgency, those bills will mount and will put intolerable pressure
              not only on the Department of Education but, indeed, on the entire
              Executive.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Education
              (Mr Kennedy):</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I speak on behalf of the Committee for
              Education and Ulster Unionist Party members to condemn
              unreservedly all sectarian attacks on schools, pupils, parents,
              property, teachers, principals and staff. There is no place in any
              decent society for people who carry out such attacks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will be aware that attacks have
              taken place on various schools, not only in Belfast but across
              Northern Ireland. I draw his attention to the sectarian attacks on
              Strabane Grammar School, in which the school transport was
              attacked.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned that the Minister has hinted
              that his Department will not make available any additional
              resources to counter those attacks. On behalf of the Committee —

              sectarian conflict?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr Kennedy. He specifically
              mentioned the situation at Strabane Grammar School. I found that
              attack deplorable, and I have no hesitation in saying that
              everyone must do everything in his power to convince those people
              that it is not sensible to attack schoolchildren, school property
              or transport, no matter from where the children come. The people
              responsible need to catch themselves on and recognise that their
              behaviour is unacceptable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I replied to Ms McWilliams that, to meet
              various pressures, my Department is making substantial bids for
              additional resources under the Executive’s reinvestment and
              reform initiative and the 2002 spending review. That will include
              a bid for additional capital funds to enable the Department and
              boards to respond to schools’ requests for additional security
              measures.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ultimately, we all know that such initiatives
              could become a bottomless pit. We must address the reason for the
              attacks, which is why political and community leaders have a
              responsibility to lead by example. We must show compassion for one
              another, and we must recognise that we are on the one road
              together to a new future and that part of that new future is a
              society in which all children, no matter where they come from, can
              be educated in peace and with some hope of permanent employment
              and real prosperity in life.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the largest ever consultation on an
              education issue; response forms were distributed to over 670,000
              households. The distribution took longer than anticipated due to
              the massive scale of the exercise, but all the forms have now been
              delivered. The deadline for the receipt of responses is 28 June,
              which gives people sufficient time. I will not extend that
              deadline. Already we have received some 100,000 responses, so my
              officials will have a considerable volume of work over the summer.</p>

              be able to express his or her views. The form seeks views on key

              neither practical nor sensible to have formal weightings of

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am reluctant to enter into a negative debate
              about any aspect of the work that we have been involved in. This
              is an incredibly important, valuable, positive and constructive
              debate. Many education sectors have had their say on these issues.
              I have been involved in extensive meetings with all education
              interest groups, and there will be more meetings. All of those
              meetings were invaluable. We have heard powerful statements from
              representatives of the Protestant churches, who are opposed to
              academic selection at the age of 11, and from Catholic bishops,
              citing their opposition to academic selection.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a growing consensus on that, which is
              at the core of the debate. We must face up to the fact that we
              have a responsibility — as Minister of Education, I certainly
              have a responsibility — to meet the challenge of creating a
              stronger education system. We must enhance the system and deal
              with the key issue, which is not institutions, but what will be
              good for all our children. We must put the best possible education
              system in place and fit the institutions around the needs of our
              children, rather than the other way around.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New pre-school places are being provided under
              the Department of Education’s pre-school education expansion
              programme. The places are planned by pre-school education advisory
              groups in the education and library boards and are being created
              in all grant-aided school sectors and in the voluntary and private
              playgroup sector. The programme is an important element of the
              interdepartmental childcare strategy and of the Department of
              Education’s strategy for targeting social need.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Admissions priority is given to children from
              socially disadvantaged circumstances who are most likely to
              experience difficulty at school and to the oldest four-year-olds.
              The effect of the expansion programme is to provide an equalising
              of opportunity in pre-school education. That is a positive measure
              in the context of the equality legislation.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s comments, but is he
              aware of the effect of offering nursery provision in mainstream
              schooling on the community voluntary sector? The number of places
              is shrinking, trained carers are losing their jobs and trained
              teachers are being retrained to care for pre-school children from
              the age of three and upwards. This contrasts with the rest of
              Europe, where children do not normally go into mainstream
              schooling until the age of six. Will the Minister look again at
              this sector with equality and TSN legislation in mind?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that some people hold the view that
              there is an equality issue involved in the different number of
              places allocated to individual settings in the statutory,
              voluntary and private sectors under the expansion programme.
              However, I cannot accept any suggestion of inequality. In the
              statutory sector the minimum number is 26, while in the private
              and voluntary sector it is five. In both cases we are talking
              about thresholds relating to viability, and not minimum
              entitlements. If playgroups were each to receive 26 funded places
              as a minimum, very few would receive places, and coverage would be
              very sparse.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am fully aware of the concerns of the
              voluntary and private sector. In planning the expansion programme,
              the pre-school education advisory groups have adhered to a set of
              jointly agreed and adopted principles on displacement. They have
              aimed to avoid displacement where possible and have actively
              sought to avoid displacing good quality pre-school provision. It
              should be borne in mind that the expansion programme is part of a
              wider childcare strategy that has other elements. Many parents
              require care for their children outside the two and a half hour
              period of free pre-school education. In some cases, the
              establishment of a statutory nursery unit may free up capacity in
              voluntary or private provision and allow these providers to focus
              on wrap-around childcare.</p>

              those at schools in the highest free school meal band. This has
              been the position for the last three years. The disparity is even
              more pronounced in schools under non-Catholic management, where
              pupils in schools in the lowest band were almost five times as
              likely to achieve grade A as those in the highest band. This

              been unthinkable that they would ever have been invited here 20,
              30, 40 or 50 years ago. This is now an inclusive place.
              Representatives from many different political parties welcomed the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to face up to those challenges.
              Many Members from other political parties would also recognise

              people like that. They want it to work and they want us to work
              together. I am prepared to deal with the long and difficult road.
              There are people on the opposite Benches who are prepared to do
              the same because if they were not, they would not be here. Their
              presence is a powerful statement. Let us move forward sensibly and
              recognise that we must be inclusive. Let us recognise
              achievements, as we did when the Ulster rugby team won the
              European Cup and the Ballinderry Shamrocks came here. Let us
              congratulate Ireland on it’s great performance in the World Cup

              distributes funding for schools across school sectors and between
              the five boards using methodologies that are designed to assess
              relative needs. The assessment of relative needs exercise (ARNE)
              has been used successfully for the last 19 years, with periodic

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Burns Report made a range of

              education, including an end to academic selection and new
              arrangements for the admission of pupils to post-primary schools.
              I am aware of concerns about selection by postcode. Those do not
              arise from the proposal to end academic selection, but from the
              proposal of the review body to use proximity as the final
              admissions criterion where schools are oversubscribed. The review
              body has made its recommendations, and I have invited views on
              them and suggestions for modifications and alternative
              arrangements.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is open and genuine consultation, and I
              want to stress that aspects of the proposals can be amended in the
              light of responses to the consultation. Yet again, I appeal to the
              whole community to fill in their household response forms. This is
              a great opportunity to have an impact on our future education
              system. In the interests of our children, I appeal to everyone to
              send in their form. It takes only a few minutes to complete.</p>

              important in the post-review consultation period. How will the
              Minister reconcile giving priority to parental choice with the
              possibility that that might prolong the situation in which schools
              are either undersubscribed or oversubscribed?</p>

              I want to listen to what others have to say during the debate and
              the consultation process. I hope that those who have concerns
              about any of the Burns recommendations will take the opportunity

              or alternatives. However, we must recognise the importance of
              education in rural communities, and I am conscious of that. We
              will move forward sensitively, because we must recognise that many
              people have participated in the debate, and admissions criteria to
              schools are one of the issues that have been highlighted. It is
              important that people in rural areas draw attention to the point
              that the Member has made when filling in their household response

              women between the ages of 40 and 64 for screening every three

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With your permission, Mr Speaker, I shall take
              questions 3 and 5 together, as they both relate to research work
              on the siting of the new acute hospital in the Fermanagh/ Tyrone
              area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My proposals on the way forward for acute
              hospitals were published for consultation on 12 June 2002. The
              findings of the York Health Economics Consortium, along with all
              other information available to me, were considered in relation to
              the location of a new acute hospital in the Fermanagh/Tyrone area.
              My Department commissioned Dr Tony Hindle to review the reports
              ‘A Review of the Acute Hospitals Review Group Report: Final
              Report’ by the York Health Economics Consortium and ‘A New
              Acute Hospital for the South West of Northern Ireland: Report to
              Fermanagh District Council’ by Colin Stutt Consulting.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Copies of Dr Hindle’s review have been placed
              in the Assembly Library. It has also been placed on my Department’s
              Internet web site, and my Department will make copies available to
              interested parties on request.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposals that I have put forward are based
              on all the work that came forward, including the Acute Hospitals
              Review Group’s report and people’s views on it. That included
              the two reports referred to as the York Report and the Stutt
              Report. My proposals have also included further work which I asked
              my officials to take forward specifically in relation to the

              perhaps I am asking her to repeat herself. Is she assuring the
              House that Dr Tony Hindle’s further research fully considered
              the findings of the York Health Economics Consortium?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hindle was commissioned to review the two

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister accept that Dr Hindle gave a
              variation of that report to the Omagh Steering Group that gave a
              different view from that which it gave to the Department? It looks
              as though whoever pays gets the right answer. Does the Minister
              also accept that there has been a reduction in the number of acute
              hospitals west of the Bann? Before Hayes there was the Erne
              Hospital in Fermanagh, the Tyrone County Hospital, the South
              Tyrone Hospital, the Mid-Ulster Hospital and Altnagelvin Area
              Hospital. The number of acute hospitals has been reduced from five
              to one, with an additional one proposed. What action is being
              taken to ensure that a proper acute service is available for
              constituents in Tyrone?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is incorrect to say that the review that Dr
              Hindle carried out was given, in any shape or form, in a modified
              version to anyone in Omagh or Enniskillen. However, I have now
              placed the review in the Assembly Library and on my Department’s
              Internet web site so that people can see exactly what was said.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The view that the balance lies in locating the
              new hospital in or to the north of Enniskillen was based on all
              the information available, including Dr Hindle’s review. The
              views of all those who brought forward information during the
              consultation period were taken into account, including reports
              from groupings from various areas and work that was carried out by
              my officials on hospitals in the South.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consultation is taking place, and I am prepared
              to consider new proposals and additional information that arises
              from that.</p>

              e-government that were agreed by the Executive in July 2001, and a
              strategy is in place to meet them. Electronic business has been
              increasing in health and personal social services, and new
              Internet, web site and video conferencing facilities are in place.
              Appropriate training is being provided, and the first year of a
              three-year programme to upgrade the existing infrastructure has
              been successfully completed. Plans for the next three years
              include the establishment of a secure Intranet for health and
              personal social services, a data warehouse project to support the
              better use of information, the introduction of electronic document

              services? What steps are in place to monitor the take-up? That

              there is reluctance on the part of my Department to play its full
              part in this. It is fully participating in all of the groups that
              have been set up, and it is committed to the targets that have
              been set out. The Executive have set a target of 25% of key
              services, determined by Departments, to be in place by 2002, and
              100% of those services are to be in place by 2005. An agreed
              programme of action is in place to meet those targets. It is
              monitored by a committee which is chaired by one of my deputy

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all recognise the need for more public
              awareness of any e-government initiatives undertaken by the
              Minister’s Department, as a sizeable proportion of the public do
              not know what online services are on offer. How will she let most
              people know about this? Will she link it in with the National
              Health Service?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Currently my major target is to improve the
              amount of work that we carry out through e-business. For example,
              we have achieved targets to provide information electronically to
              the public and opportunities for feedback via the Department’s
              web site. As Members will know from my previous answer, that
              pertains to consultation and other documents, which are routinely
              published online. The public can respond electronically using the
              feedback facility.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Work to maximise clarity in the provision of
              information on health and personal social services and to achieve
              faster, more accurate collation of information is on target for
              the first phase of implementation. All departmental circulars to
              health and personal social services are to be available online,
              and all health and personal social services returns to the
              Department are to be facilitated online by 31 March 2005.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One example of how we are maximising the other
              work and providing faster and better quality briefing is that a
              project manager has been appointed and a series of system
              presentations is being arranged, so work is continuing in several
              areas. As Members will know, we have made progress in introducing
              similar work in health and social services; they use e-business
              services in finance and administration, and health and personal
              social services business with private-sector suppliers involves
              electronic ordering and payments.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department is carrying out work throughout
              the system. It has also made considerable bids throughout the
              period for Executive programme funds. I know from the questions
              today that Members will support those bids to enable that work to
              be taken further.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As with all projects for which there is
              short-term funding, the Department must consider that issue then.
              The Member will remember the question that arose in relation to
              the drugs project, for example, which was limited in action
              because limited finance was available. However, when that finance
              ran out, I found money from my budget to take forward 23 projects
              within my remit. I also contacted other Departments to find out
              whether they could do the same within their remits.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot therefore guarantee what will happen.
              However, Sure Start is radical, cross-departmental and will
              improve services for children and families. I am supportive of it
              to the point that when, in July&nbsp;2000, 15&nbsp;Sure Start
              projects were approved for funding, I allocated funding of
              £1·8&nbsp;million from April&nbsp;2001 to allow a small number
              of projects to fill the gaps in some highly disadvantaged areas
              that had no Sure Start projects.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have spoken with Micheál Martin TD, Minister
              for Health and Children, and have sent him a copy of the recently
              published consultation paper on the way forward for acute
              services, ‘Developing Better Services: Modernising Hospitals and
              Reforming Structures’. We have agreed to meet soon to address
              the issues involved. The matter has also been the subject of a
              meeting and correspondence between senior officials in my
              Department and the Department of Health and Children in Dublin on
              the potential use of hospitals in Cavan and Sligo to provide
              services to patients from the North.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also carefully considered the findings of the
              York Health Economics Consortium at the University of York. From
              the current planning stage for hospital services in the South, it
              was apparent that insufficient certainty exists about whether the
              relevant hospitals in the South will deliver, over the longer
              term, the capacity and services equivalent to those provided by
              the nine proposed acute hospitals in the North. Any information
              that emerges during the consultation process will be considered
              before final decisions are reached. On almost every occasion that
              I have spoken with Micheál Martin, the issues raised have touched
              on acute hospital provision.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McElduff:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.
              Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire as a freagra.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will appreciate that my question
              is prompted by a desire for a seamless provision of cross-border
              health and hospital services. It emanates from great community
              anger at the proposal to withdraw acute services from the Tyrone
              County Hospital in Omagh, which saved a young man’s life at the
              weekend. A 25-year-old man who arrived at the hospital with a
              ruptured spleen is alive today because of the Tyrone County
              Hospital.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister clarify precisely whether her
              proposals have, in part or in total, White Paper or Green Paper
              status? Is the consultation process real or meaningless? Will it
              finally begin to examine evidence? I raise those issues because
              senior officials have been publicly saying that some aspects of
              the proposals have White Paper status, thereby undermining any
              real notion of consultation.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Member. I also wish to see
              seamless provision and to ensure that people can access services
              as necessary. I reiterate my commitment to all-Ireland and
              cross-border developments. I shall explore further with my
              counterpart Micheál Martin how acute services on both sides of
              the border will contribute to the provision of a world-class
              health service on this island.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The present consultation is a real
              consultation. It will allow people to have an input. I am prepared
              to consider new proposals or additional information that arise
              from the consultation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member mentioned a White Paper. The
              proposals on the development of hospital services are the most
              worked and detailed proposals from which we can move forward at
              the end of the consultation period. The title of the consultation
              paper mentions modernising structures. Work on the structures
              contains some relatively new aspects, which are less detailed.
              That is not surprising, given the ongoing review of public
              administration. Those aspects have Green Paper status. The paper
              makes it clear that some further work and consultation will be
              needed on structures before deciding on final configurations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the section on the proposals for acute
              hospital services was the subject of much discussion and
              consultation before Executive Colleagues discussed it and before
              consultation was agreed. It therefore has the stronger status at
              this stage of firm proposals.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Fee:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If people need acute hospital care, are
              vulnerable and in ill health, it is irrelevant on a small island
              such as Ireland where they go to be cured or for the necessary
              treatment. I welcome moves to improve the situation in Cavan and
              Sligo, but the population and demographics of the hinterland
              around Armagh, Newry, Monaghan, Dundalk and Drogheda lend
              themselves to much closer co-operation between the health boards
              and the health authorities. There is an enormous gap in provision
              on both sides of the border, and there is much work to be done.</p>

              all-Ireland and cross-border developments. Members will know of
              the work of Co-operation and Working Together and with the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the recent consultative document, the
              Minister recognised Fermanagh’s isolation by apparently
              acknowledging the recommendation of the Hayes Report that the new
              hospital in the south-west be built slightly north of Enniskillen.
              Does she consider that it is now important to confirm such intent?
              That would inject confidence into the area.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I confirm that that is the basis of my
              proposals. However, the consultation process is real, and I cannot
              pre-empt it. Decisions must be taken. After consultation, I hope
              to discuss the matter further with Executive Colleagues and to
              take final decisions in 2002.</p>

              Nevertheless, will the Minister ensure that in future patients
              will be hospitalised as close to home as possible, regardless of
              the side of the border on which the hospital is located?</p>
              <b>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People want the hospital services that are best
              for them. We should ensure that the preferred hospitals in our
              plans can provide services that are equivalent to those in the
              nine proposed acute hospitals in the North.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My proposals, which allow for clinical
              networking and give the basis for our community services, local
              hospitals and acute services to work together to offer free
              hospital care, will provide the best possible access to services
              for those who need them, centralising where necessary and

              and Personnel has made good progress in laying the foundations for
              e-government. It has installed the infrastructure<b> </b>required
              to run electronic business systems, which includes<b> connecting
              the former Department of the Environment agencies — the Land
              Registers of Northern Ireland, the Rate Collection Agency, the
              Construction Service and the accommodation and construction
              division — to the Department’s network.</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main focus over the last three years, apart
              from the public service network, has been LandWeb Direct, which is
              a major project for the Land Registers of Northern Ireland to make
              the land registration service available through its web site. It
              will be the first service to be delivered electronically through
              the Government Gateway in Northern Ireland. Separately, the
              Department has set up a project to create a one-stop shop for
              European funding.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of internal corporate applications,
              that is, the electronic delivery of services to all staff, the
              main platform project has been the production of an online
              Northern Ireland Civil Service staff directory. Across the
              Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Department has developed the
              public service network that addresses the common need for all
              Departments to have access to high-speed voice, video and data
              communications and is a key facility to support the electronic
              delivery of Government services. It is the primary platform to
              implement the delivery of joined-up applications and services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking ahead, the Executive have set targets
              for 25% of all key services to be capable of being delivered
              electronically by the end of 2002 and 100% by the end of 2005.
              Therefore, the Department is developing an e-business strategy, on
              which work will be finalised shortly. The strategy has identified
              the enabling and other projects necessary to help meet the
              targets, and work will start shortly on a detailed implementation
              plan for the next three years.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister may be aware of the perception
              that there is at best a reluctance and at worst a degree of
              resistance in Departments to implementing electronic methods of
              communication and doing business. Although he outlined targets for
              the availability of electronic services, what targets are there
              for the take-up and use of these services, and what steps are in
              place to monitor the progress of their use?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said that an implementation plan covering the
              next three years is being prepared. The plan will include a
              process whereby its implementation will be regularly monitored. As
              for a perceived reluctance in parts of the Northern Ireland Civil
              Service to use the electronic means at our disposal to
              communicate, inform and deliver services, I am not aware of any
              concerted reluctance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must bear in mind that all change has a
              human dimension, because change, in the use and extension of
              electronic means of communication for whatever purpose, challenges
              existing modes of operation. In that sense, we must engage in an
              educational process as we introduce various aspects of
              e-government. I am sure that all Members will appreciate that
              those of us who have begun to use electronic communication at a
              later stage in our careers have experienced something of the
              difficulty, and I am sure that that will be appreciated as we
              introduce those means. There is a willingness to accept, develop
              and extend its use across the Civil Service.</p>

              first phase next month. The second phase requires compulsory
              redemption of the ground rent. That phase will be introduced in
              late 2003 once the necessary computerisation of Land Registry
              services is complete.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his detailed response.
              However, it is disappointing to discover that we do not yet have a
              commencement date 15 or 16 months after the Bill received Royal
              Assent.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister tell us what costs the
              implementation of the Act will incur? Will he also assure the
              House that he will take every step to ensure that the Act will be
              implemented as quickly as possible? It is causing concern. Does he
              accept that there has been an undue delay, bearing in mind that 15
              months have elapsed since the Bill received Royal Assent?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge that there has been some delay,
              but the Member will appreciate that introducing the Ground Rents
              Act (Northern Ireland) 2001 is a complicated process that involves
              several separate pieces of subordinate legislation. Of those, the
              most important are amendments to land registration rules that
              provide the practical working-out of the policy. Work on those
              rules could start only once the primary legislation was finalised.
              Additionally, consultation on the draft rules was necessary before
              they could be brought to the Chamber. The implementation of the
              compulsory scheme is, therefore, scheduled for the end of 2003.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise that that is not what some Members
              had hoped for, but it is important that we take time to learn any
              practical lessons that emerge from the voluntary scheme that is
              effectively a pilot. It is also important that we ensure that the
              Land Registers’ new computerisation system, LandWeb, is properly
              implemented and capable of meeting demands. The timetable allows
              the compulsory scheme to be introduced alongside the introduction
              of compulsory first registration of existing unregistered
              residential property. That process has already begun.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In ascertaining how much it will cost to buy
              out ground rent, I have decided that the multiplier that will be
              used in calculating compensation payable to the rent owner will be
              nine times the annual ground rent. That figure was decided on with
              the expert advice of Valuation and Lands Agency and is an accurate
              reflection of current market value for the purchase of a ground
              rent.</p>

              retirement issue affects not only the Senior Civil Service but the
              entire Northern Ireland Civil Service. We hope this autumn to

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I certainly do agree that all public
              expenditure must be open to the closest and most detailed auditing
              and accountability. The Member will be aware that the Executive
              are committed to transparency, and I trust that the planned
              legislation will make a significant contribution to meeting that
              objective. Local government and its accountability will be subject
              to detailed consideration in the review of public administration.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Public Accounts
              Committee (Mr B Bell):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement and the
              assurances that he seems to be giving. When the Chancellor of the
              Exchequer recently announced extra money for health, he said that
              an auditor would be appointed to inspect the spending of this
              money. Does the Minister believe that a separate auditor for
              Northern Ireland is essential?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take it that the suggestion is for a separate
              auditor for the Health Service. That matter is under consideration
              by the Executive.</p>
