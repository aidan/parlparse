                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members are familiar with the purpose of the
                Bill and the reasons behind it, therefore I do not propose to
                rehearse those reasons in any detail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The effect of the Bill is to afford my
                Department a shorter and more practical title that continues to
                represent its key business areas. The Committee for Higher and
                Further Education, Training and Employment and I agree that the
                title ‘Department for Employment and Learning’ meets all of
                those criteria. I have assured Members that the costs of
                implementing the change are not significant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we approach the end of the current
                session, I would like to record my thanks to the Committee for
                Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment. This is
                possibly the last time that I will refer to them with that
                lengthy and cumbersome title. I thank the Committee and its
                staff for their work throughout what has been a busy and
                challenging year, during which we found ourselves on a steep
                learning curve. I trust that under our new title the working
                relationship that we have established with the Committee will
                continue and be enhanced.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Higher
                and Further Education, Training and Employment (Dr Birnie):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad to rise for what I hope, as the
                Minister said, will be the last time that I will be the called
                the Chairperson of the Committee for Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment. The Committee supports the
                Bill. It will lead to a more appropriate title for the
                Department and one that will be easier to remember. At Further
                Consideration Stage, I said that the Committee considered a
                variety of names for the Department. We are glad that the
                Minister took on board the recommendation to change the name to
                the Department for Employment and Learning, which can be
                shortened to DEL. We are heartened that the press has welcomed
                the new title for this important Department. The Committee
                welcomes the fact that the Bill will complete its Final Stage
                before the summer recess.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge the work of the Minister and
                his officials in speedily progressing the matter to ensure that
                the Bill was completed in time. Simply changing the name of the
                Department will not create a job for anyone who is currently
                unemployed and will not put anyone on a training scheme.
                However, it is important that we get the matter right and clear
                the decks for future work. It is to be hoped that we can turn to
                that work as the Department for Employment and Learning.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will keep my remarks brief, not least

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill has passed through the various
                Stages of scrutiny, and there is a consensus and understanding
                that it is necessary to give effect to a European obligation.
                Some Members made the point that on the face of it the Bill
                imposes a theoretical additional liability on farmers and others
                at an unfortunate time. The Agriculture and Rural Development
                Committee also registered that concern. The Bill will be of
                longer-term benefit to such groups, as it will represent a small
                but significant step in restoring public confidence in food
                safety. Consumer groups and producers have noted that and
                welcome the measure. There have been no reported difficulties
                for farming communities in other European countries that have
                this legislation in force.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly calls on the Ministers
                responsible for the protection of children, in view of the
                anomalies in the current vetting system, to take the necessary
                interim steps to improve the position on vetting those suitable
                to work with children.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly has given priority to child
                protection, and it is an issue that unites politicians from all
                parties. It is appropriate that the motion is being debated
                today, with the recent report released by Barnardo’s on child
                prostitution and the targeting and grooming of young boys by
                paedophiles. It is widely accepted that we have unacceptably
                high levels of child abuse in Northern Ireland. That can be
                directly and indirectly related to the lack of investment,
                insufficient political direction during direct rule and poorly
                thought-out policy development that did not join up government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the first pieces of legislation
                proposed by the Executive in September 2000 was the Protection
                of Children and Vulnerable Adults Bill, which will do much to
                strengthen the system of vetting people to ensure their
                suitability to work with children. That will no doubt follow on
                from the Protection of Children Act 2000 passed at Westminster
                and will fit into arrangements in the UK and Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the open movement of people in the EU,
                vetting is a local, national and international problem. One of
                the greatest challenges in our Act is to consider the issue on
                an all-Ireland basis, because the legislation will only work as
                part of an overall system to protect children in both parts of
                this island. However, the issue will be complex and has the
                potential to slow down developments here, while the pace of
                change with the Protection of Children Act in England is rapid.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For several years, others viewed the system
                of vetting in Northern Ireland as a good model with the then
                prevailing practice. The Martin Huston report in 1993 brought
                about several changes to the vetting system and considerable
                investment by the then Department of Health and Social Services
                in training and new guidance to ensure that vetting checks were
                carried out by a wide range of organisations, including those in
                the voluntary sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many organisations and the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety have invested heavily
                in systems designed to weed out those people who are unsuitable
                to work with children. However, the system requires more than an
                infrastructure to work; there is a real danger of getting lost
                in process and being unable to see the wood for the trees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most recent figures from the RUC for
                1999-00 state that 788 sexual offences involving children were
                reported in Northern Ireland. In the previous year, the figure
                was 1,037. For a variety of reasons many of the perpetrators
                will not be successfully prosecuted. That alone merits a
                separate debate in the House. Very few convictions will be noted
                on the criminal records system or names added to the sex
                offenders register. That underlines the importance of the
                Pre-Employment Consultancy Service (PECS), which operates
                outside the criminal justice system and which should detect
                those people who harm children but are not prosecuted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was astounded to note, from a written
                answer from the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety, that only 16 individuals are currently listed on the
                PECS register, notwithstanding the apparently broad criteria for
                reporting to the Department and for inclusion on the PECS
                register. I am concerned about that.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can have the best infrastructure for
                vetting those who work with children, but the system will fail
                if individuals are not reported and added to the PECS register.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That raises several issues. First, why are
                there so few individuals on the PECS register? What is the
                Department doing to remedy that in the lengthy period before the
                new legislation is passed?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, there is the issue of public
                confidence in a process that may not be as robust as it appears
                to the general public and members of those organisations who use
                PECS. There should not be an overreliance on PECS; it must be
                part of a wider, vigorous recruitment procedure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, with regard to the established
                Protection of Children Act list in England and Wales and the
                proposal for a criminal records bureau throughout the UK, we
                must have confidence in what is checked by the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety when vetting
                individuals. Is the list held by the Department of Education
                routinely checked? What is the position concerning people coming
                over from Scotland? Is the Protection of Children Act list
                checked against the Department of Education’s list?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since it will take time to pass new
                legislation and get the processes absolutely right, it is
                imperative that interim measures be put in place to address many
                of those issues. The vetting process should be examined,
                weaknesses and strengths should be identified and guidance
                should be reviewed to account for changing practice. The wider
                public and users of the PECS system must be informed about what
                it can and cannot do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those people who pose a risk to children know
                no borders and will exploit any loopholes and anomalies in the
                systems in the North and South of this island. That is one of
                the weakest aspects in the operation of the current system. It
                is more than a theoretical risk that unscrupulous individuals
                who appear on either list would seek to move across the border
                to the Republic of Ireland, where no such checks are carried
                out. We urgently need effective cross- border arrangements put
                into the proposed protection of children and vulnerable adults
                legislation, and we should implement policies and protocols at
                this stage. Failure to do so exposes the Achilles heel of our
                vetting system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two issues must be addressed as soon as
                possible. In a reply to a question for oral answer, the Minister
                stated that it is not possible for organisations in the Irish
                Republic to access the PECS system of the Department of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety. That is unacceptable, and
                given the movement among the population North and South, it
                seems perverse that we are not taking urgent steps to remedy the
                situation. It is possible for checks to be carried out through
                the Garda Síochána and the RUC on Northern-domiciled staff who
                work in the South. We should be working towards a similar system
                in relation to the PECS and List 99 information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several organisations in Northern Ireland
                employ staff from the Republic of Ireland. The Department of
                Health and Social Service’s 1996 guidance on vetting in ‘Making
                the Right Choice’ highlights that there are no equivalent
                registers, such as PECS and List 99, in the Irish Republic. In
                practice, however, the Department’s forms are used to obtain a
                police check, and it is often assumed by the organisation that
                staff from the Irish Republic are vetted to the same level as
                their Northern counterparts. The Departments must make clear to
                organisations what is and is not involved in a PECS check of
                staff from outside this jurisdiction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party welcomes the North/South child
                protection working group that has been established through the
                North/South Ministerial Council. Collaboration on the protection
                of children on both sides of the border is long overdue.
                However, we must recognise that respective Departments and their
                civil servants will not have all the answers or solutions, and
                neither may they be au fait with issues on the ground.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many voluntary and non-governmental
                organisations have expertise in that field, and it is essential
                that they are involved as full partners in the debate. New
                equality legislation in section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act
                1998 is designed to ensure a new partnership between Government
                and the voluntary sector. We must ensure that that partnership
                is demonstrated in dealing with such an important issue. Both
                Ministers should detail how they intend to augment the expertise
                of their civil servants.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our children are entitled to the highest
                level of protection that society can offer. It is essential not
                only that we ensure that young people are properly protected,
                but that we defend their human rights and promote their right to
                equality. The Administration should demonstrate that the care
                and protection of young people in Northern Ireland is its
                highest priority. We must send those who prey on our children a
                clear signal that their evil ways will not be tolerated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Offenders can change their name by deed poll.
                That matter is not in the remit of any of the Ministers here; it
                is the responsibility of the Secretary of State, and I have
                brought it up with him several times. What legal requirement is
                there for offenders to report such a change to the relevant
                authorities? That loophole has not been given adequate
                consideration and negates the effect of the PECS checks. The
                Secretary of State should address that issue without delay,
                enabling us to pull our child protection legislation together
                and provide effective measures to deal with the problem. I urge
                the Ministers who are responsible for PECS and List 99 to make a
                recommendation to the Secretary of State about that issue.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our main difficulty is that suitability
                checks are not applied in a standard fashion throughout the
                Province. Also, there is no system that applies to workers
                coming in from Wales, England or Scotland, mainly because of the
                speed with which devolution has taken place. There are no quick
                verifiable checks in place. The Assembly should take that on
                board, and the Minister should try to establish a comprehensive
                system of suitability checking as quickly as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There could be some operational difficulties
                for schools. Education and library boards have established a
                system of suitability checks for schools to use. However, those
                of us who are involved in community work will know that
                nowadays, many after-school activities take place in community
                centres, including after-school playgroups and work with
                children with learning difficulties. Many such activities are
                operated by community groups. That is where the expertise is
                lacking, and Ms Lewsley should have concentrated on that area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People working in such circumstances should
                receive clear guidance. People with a perverse nature may be
                able to insinuate themselves into that new situation. Whereas
                they would previously have been detected by the Government
                institutions, they may now be able to take advantage of that
                opportunity. We must ensure that support for children goes
                further than is envisaged in the motion. There are agencies, not
                directly under the Minister’s control but under the control of
                community or voluntary agencies, that deal with children almost
                from birth until they leave school and beyond. Such agencies
                must be given help with carrying out suitability checks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not buy into Ms Lewsley’s suggestion
                that all-Ireland institutions be established. A good deal of
                child abuse has taken place in all-Ireland-based institutions.
                We are all aware that personnel who have created difficulties in
                schools and institutions in the North of Ireland have been moved
                to the South of Ireland to camouflage their perversion. It is
                therefore essential that our Minister has direct responsibility
                for establishing suitability checks on individuals, whether they
                arrive from England, Scotland, Wales, elsewhere in Europe, or
                America. There must also be a code of conduct to examine not
                only those who have been prosecuted for these offences, but
                individuals about whom there are personnel files that hold
                details suggesting that a degree of perversion has been
                detected. Often, people are moved on quietly to ensure
                discretion or to protect the good name of an institution.
                Sometimes people are protected quietly by a change in the
                institution in which they work. We are all too aware of examples
                of such incidents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In general, I support the resolution, but I
                ask that the relevant Minister take direct responsibility,
                because he can establish quickly in his Department the necessary
                suitability checks and procedures. The onus is on us to
                establish codes of good practice to safeguard children. Those of
                us who do not have any expertise in that field should put codes
                of good practice in place in our community groups. Those should
                extend as equally to small rural playgroups as to organisations
                in conurbations where operations may already exist. We all share
                that responsibility. It is easy to focus on the main
                institutions such as schools, but we do not always consider
                smaller organisations such as voluntary and community groups,
                which provide day-to-day activities for the youth of our
                community.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. I thank Ms Lewsley for
                proposing the motion. It should be welcomed, because this is the
                last plenary session before the summer recess, and children’s
                rights are at the top of the agenda again. Other Members have
                highlighted issues concerning the PECS system and List 99.
                However, as Ms Lewsley mentioned, we must take on board the fact
                that many Departments and Ministers have some form of
                responsibility for children. The Minister of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety, the Minister of Education, the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister and the Northern Ireland
                Office all have some responsibility for children, so it is not
                surprising that the legislation relating to the issue can be
                confusing. Until we have a Minister who has overarching
                responsibility for children, none of those Departments can take
                the lead to ensure that children’s rights are paramount. The
                ‘Our Duty to Care’ document states that</p>

                establishing good practice, taking the necessary steps to
                improve the vetting procedure minimises the potential for abuse
                and maximises the level of safety for our children.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The present vetting system, whether carried
                out by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety or the Department of Education, has its problems.</p>
                <i>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must welcome the proposed protection of
                children and vulnerable adults Bill that is due in the next few
                months, as it will put the legislation on a statutory footing.
                We must protect children throughout the island. Every week,
                press and television reports tell us of someone being convicted
                in the South who moves North and vice versa. That problem must
                be tackled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Allowing groups and agencies to check an
                all-Ireland register would help prevent unsuitable people from
                working with children. Many of those groups have voluntary
                workers, yet they have no way of accessing these lists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must review the vetting system, as most of
                those who offend against children are not convicted for various
                reasons. That is perhaps an issue for another day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are aware that the Departments and the
                social services keep a list of people whom they deem to be
                unsuitable. However, many groups find it hard to access that
                list, and we must examine ways of making it easier for them to
                do so. Groups must follow a procedure to gain access to the
                list. First, they must contact the childcare unit. Then they
                must give details of the constitution and structure of the group
                and names and addresses of their members and officer board. They
                must provide a job description, show how the applicant will have
                access to children and state why access is unavoidable. All of
                that must take place before they are allowed to access the list.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sharing information is important in assessing
                whether children are at risk and in ensuring their safety. We
                must make those procedures easier so that organisations can
                access that information. Why do we create problems for groups
                and organisations that want to access information to ensure that
                the children in their organisations are safe?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, and I agree with the
                mover that we must get this right. I welcome the proposed
                protection of children and vulnerable adults Bill. We must
                examine the North/South and all-Ireland child protection
                initiatives. Has that child protection work been stopped by the
                refusal of the First Minister, or the caretaker First Minister,
                to nominate Ministers? That must also be examined.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I pay tribute to the community and voluntary
                organisations that work in this sector. I also pay tribute to
                local councils, especially Lisburn Borough Council, for its work
                with the NSPCC in drawing up childcare policies. Groups,
                organisations and local councils have taken the lead and
                implemented the ‘Our Duty to Care’ booklet despite problems
                from the Departments. They have left the Departments behind in
                that matter. It is up to us to ensure that that legislation is
                put in place so that we can complement the good work of the
                community and voluntary sectors and local councils.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must ensure that Ministers implement the
                relevant legislation and get rid of the red tape. We must make
                it easier for interested groups to access the list of those who
                have been deemed unsuitable to work with children so that we can
                ensure that children’s rights and safety are paramount. I
                support the motion, and I thank Ms Lewsley for moving it today.

                reasons. I fervently believe that children are important; that
                is the bottom line. We must do everything in our power to
                protect them and give them the quality of life that they are

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support wholeheartedly the motion in the
                name of Ms Lewsley, whom I am pleased and proud to work with on
                the all-party children’s committee. We will continue to work
                with the organisations mentioned by Sue Ramsey, to ensure that
                the vetting system will be amended. Voting for the motion will
                help that work. I congratulate the Members, including Patricia
                Lewsley, for their comprehensive speeches.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Statistics on abuse of children in Northern
                Ireland are horrifying, and I make no apology for stating them.
                The NSPCC and the Voluntary Development Agency provided the
                figures. In 1995, seventy children suffered the horrors of rape.
                In 1996, the figure was higher. The estimates for last year are
                that three children were raped and 12 were assaulted every week.
                Last year alone, over 900 sexual offences were recorded, and the
                rape figures were over 150 — the tip of an iceberg, Mr
                Speaker. We must do more to protect our children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley has already talked about the
                problems with the Protection of Children Act, List 1999 and the
                PECS register, and these must be addressed immediately and
                directly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The realisation that something must be done
                has grown steadily over the years. A turning point for many
                people, certainly for those in my own constituency, was the
                tragic case of the abuse perpetrated by a senior teacher at
                Bangor Grammar School. Strangers rarely threaten our children
                — it is usually people they know, respect and trust. We must
                do everything possible to ensure that the people involved with
                our children are worthy of that trust. One of the ways in which
                we can do this is to educate the general public with correct
                information and provide access to advice and support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most children are abused by adults whom they
                know and trust. The reported cases of child abuse are just the
                tip of the iceberg of the cruelty, exploitation and neglect to
                which children in our society are subjected. Disabled children
                are more vulnerable to abuse. They are more dependant on
                intimate care and are sometimes less able to tell anyone or run
                away from abusive situations. Children fear the consequences of
                telling; if things are bad, perhaps they will get worse.
                Unfortunately, many children have become very good at hiding
                their unhappiness and distress. Another statistic, which I find
                horrifying, is that the majority of children whose names were
                placed on the child protection register in Northern Ireland in
                1995 were between one and nine years of age.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Westminster passed the Protection of Children
                Act 1999, which allows for the establishment of a criminal
                records bureau and a list maintained by the Secretary of State
                to prevent abusers moving from one location to another to
                continue the horrific attacks on our children and society. I can
                only hope, as I am sure do all Members, that the bureau is
                created and action plans are implemented as quickly as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The NSPCC has supported the use of
                independent visitors for some time. The role of an independent
                visitor is to befriend, advise and have an independent, positive
                relationship with the child or young person. The NSPCC carried
                out research on young people in care who had access to an
                independent visitor. Key findings of ‘Official Friends and
                Friendly Officials’ were that independent visitors received
                high approval ratings from young people and played an important
                role in mediating or advising young people when problems arose.

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As became evident during the recent
                foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, Northern Ireland shares a
                border with another state, and it is all too easy for a
                perpetrator to move from the South to the North or vice versa.
                Such movement on either side usually masks an unsavoury past. I
                therefore wholeheartedly support the idea of an all-Ireland
                children’s strategy. Mr Gibson, when he was outlining his
                argument against such a strategy, only illustrated that if we
                work together, we get things done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Probation Board for Northern Ireland
                works closely with the South, and that leads to effective
                action. Our aim is to establish an effective working partnership
                between the two countries and between Departments on this
                project, which concerns us all. A great benefit of the Assembly
                is that we can raise the issues that affect the people of
                Northern Ireland and work towards solutions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What are the Ministers doing to increase the
                safety of our children, and how are they implementing the
                Protection of Children Act 1999? What measures are they taking
                in conjunction with their Southern counterparts to ensure the
                safety of all children on the island? The public must be given
                more direct access and practical information so that children
                are confident that there is broad support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most important reason for supporting the
                motion is to protect children, who are our most valuable
                resource. Let us make their childhood safe. We welcome the
                forthcoming protection of children and vulnerable adults Bill.
                The motion also gives us a chance to illustrate how the Assembly
                can make a difference to the lives of children and everyone in
                Northern Ireland. If we protect our children now, we will have a
                better society in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can make a difference for the better.
                There should be no loopholes. Our children should be protected
                effectively and practically, and I am confident that we can
                accomplish that. The consensus that was evident today will
                continue: therefore it is with pleasure that I support the
                motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support Patricia Lewsley’s motion. There
                is dissatisfaction with the current system for vetting those who
                work with children. The protection of our children in any
                circumstance is most important. Anyone who comes into contact
                with children through employment or on a voluntary basis must be
                suitably vetted. We must encourage and promote the highest
                standards of child safety in all strands of our society, because
                no strand is immune from child abuse. We must learn from the
                lessons of the past and ensure that the future is safer for our
                children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who could forget the Waterhouse report, which
                catalogued a horrifying account of child abuse and the failure
                of a system designed to safeguard vulnerable children. Last year’s
                report by Warwickshire County Council listed several
                initiatives, the adoption of which could be considered as an
                interim measure. These included introducing a whistle-blowing
                policy for staff to report matters of concern, and making it an
                offence to fail to report bad practice or misconduct. It also
                called for more inspection reports and safeguard checks to be
                carried out on all residential placements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any vetting procedure must be implemented in
                co-operation with all the recognised children’s organisations
                and the RUC to give maximum protection to our children, who are
                the most vulnerable sector of our society. I ask the Ministers
                and the Departments concerned to take immediate suitable interim
                steps to improve the situation until there is a more extensive
                debate on the matter in the autumn.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, and I congratulate Ms
                Lewsley for proposing it at this critical time. Children are the
                most vulnerable people in our society and must be protected. At
                present there are insufficient places available to children who
                are in need of care.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week a headline in The ‘Derry Journal’
                said &quot;Review slams trust — Kids forced into unsafe
                homes&quot;. According to that newspaper report, children are
                being forced into residential homes that have insufficient
                resources. They are also placed in foster homes. However, there
                are also inadequate places available. We know what happened in
                Belfast when a 14-year-old slipped and fell because he was
                probably placed somewhere that initially seemed safe but was
                not.</p>
                <i>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Foyle Trust, there have been inadequate
                placements of children in residential care. At times, children
                have been placed with parents or relatives who do not have the
                resources to look after them. A report from the Western Health
                and Social Services Board states that even when children are
                placed in care, staff at times were inadequately trained,
                inadequately supervised and were experiencing unacceptable
                workload pressures. It stated that foster carers in the Western
                Health and Social Services Board area had not been offered
                training in the past five years and revealed that out-of-hours
                provision could no longer be guaranteed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Shortly before I became a Member of the
                Assembly, I came as part of a deputation to the Minister of
                Heath, Social Services and Public Safety, asking for more
                resources to be put into childcare. As yet, that has not really
                happened. The report is quite damning in that it says that the
                care is just not there, and any care that is available sometimes
                falls far short of what is required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The staff are aware of the shortcomings,
                which they blame on lack of resources. For example, in north and
                west Belfast, funding, which Members would agree is inadequate,
                is 25% to 50% higher than in the Foyle Trust area. The report
                also reveals a serious lack of resources in every part of the
                family and childcare programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Assembly is about to go into recess
                and as we are unsure about what is going to happen to it, it is
                important that the motion is passed today. Without it, children
                in our society will be unprotected. The Assembly will probably
                appoint a children’s commissioner. It is necessary because
                children are our natural resource, and we have a responsibility
                to protect them. Without a children’s commissioner there is no
                way that we can protect children in the future.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that we consider child
                protection and vetting systems under the motion today rather
                than under something as daft as Megan’s Law. The difficulty is
                that when the media get their hands on a controversial and
                emotive issue such as this, they tend, with few exceptions, to
                approach it in the wrong way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not want to drive these people
                underground. We want to get them registered and put under
                surveillance. This is one way of achieving that goal, though
                there are difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present, these are only guidance
                protocols, and there will be several difficulties associated
                with them until they are put on a statutory footing. One
                difficulty is that employers are frightened, especially because
                the guidance is not statutory. There are implications for
                employers, and we must reassure them that it is better that we
                go down this road. The sooner the guidance is on a legislative
                footing, the better. I am pleased that the legislation will be
                passed to the Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                Committee, where we can go through it line by line.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The media should not hijack the issue. Most
                of the predatory abuse from individuals towards children and
                vulnerable adults — and it is predatory — is from people
                known to them. They are very clever people. Every day, during
                the research I carried out at the start of the 1990s on abuse
                and domestic violence, I thought that I had heard the worst
                story and the most incredible ingenuity used by these
                individuals in targeting children and vulnerable adults.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are always increasing our knowledge about
                how individuals abuse children, hence the point about the
                North/South connections. Those people, who are beginning to be
                detected or come under surveillance, and those who risk being
                suspended and who may end up on the PECs register, know to move
                elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where is that somewhere else on a small
                island such as this? It will probably be the Republic of
                Ireland. Unless they have been convicted in Northern Ireland,
                there is no way that they can be detected. They can move quite
                freely into organisations — which we now know they target —
                in order to reach vulnerable adults and children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have had a great deal of experience of
                accompanying individuals through the court system, but I now
                question whether I would do so again. However, I recommend that
                we pursue the criminal justice system, although having observed
                the process and having seen so many cases lost, I know it is
                very difficult to get a conviction for child abuse. That is why
                this matter is so important. These are not people with
                convictions. If they were, they would be on the police register.
                These are individuals against whom there have been allegations
                or who have served suspension in their previous employment. That
                there are only 18 people on the register tells its own story.
                There is a great deal of alarm about how to use it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me give an example. Yesterday,
                representatives of an organisation called Lifestart came to see
                me, although on a different matter. The organisation works with
                children. It has family visitors who go into homes to advise
                parents on child development — it is a fantastic scheme. It
                has found that commencing literacy and numeracy training with
                children — especially those in disadvantaged and deprived
                communities — before they start school can bring them a long
                way in their development. Lifestart wrote to the unit in the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to
                request that their family visitors be vetted and was told that
                it did not have to do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The questions that have been asked in the
                document ‘Making the Right Choice: A Guide to Using the Pre-
                employment Consultancy Service’ are:</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The answer in the case of these family
                visitors is &quot;Yes&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Is the post unsupervised or

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Is the situation isolated?&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you were in a family home by yourself the
                answer would be &quot;Yes&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Is there recurring contact?&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the family visitors were building up
                contact over time for continuity with those families and
                children, the answer would be &quot;Yes&quot;. Despite all of
                that, Lifestart was told that the vetting service does not apply
                to it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What does the organisation do instead? It
                tells its family visitors that because it has been unable to
                carry out any vetting, every time a parent leaves the room, they
                must leave too so that they are not left with a child by
                themselves in case anything should happen. That is not the way
                to proceed. It would be much better if organisations such as
                Lifestart were able to go through the system of vetting all
                their family visitors, who could then get on with their work in
                a sensible fashion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It could be a matter of resources. I was
                alarmed when I read in ‘Making the Right Choice’ that if
                organisations are applying simply to clear themselves,
                especially where there is an issue concerning disabled children,
                they should think again, unless they are able to answer all the
                questions. Then there is this incredible sentence in block type
                that says that if you have not answered these questions or taken
                yourself through these questions,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;requests for checks will be returned
                unanswered &quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a prohibitive statement to make in a
                guidance document. It would be useful if some reasons were
                given. That is where guidance falls down. It is only guidance;
                not legislation. However, the numbers speak for themselves, and
                there are concerns about the number of organisations that cannot
                complete the vetting process. They are working away while being
                able to answer those questions. People are going into homes,
                with one-to-one access that is unsupervised and unaccompanied,
                where the situation is isolated and where the contact is
                recurring.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regardless of being able to answer
                &quot;yes&quot; to all of the questions, organisations are not
                able to have their workers vetted. It is a major issue, as is
                the issue of people moving from place to place once they have
                been detected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must begin an information and awareness
                exercise. The media have just not got the message. All the
                causes that are hyped up are about children who have been abused
                by strangers, which is an extreme but rare form of abuse. Most
                abuse of children and vulnerable adults comes from people whom
                they know, and that is why such people go into these
                organisations. They are clever enough to do that. We need an
                incredible education process among parents, and this guidance is
                the first rung on the ladder towards that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is to be hoped that we will take the
                opportunity to start that educational exercise when the
                legislation comes to the Floor. Until parents, neighbours and
                the extended family know how to protect children and with whom
                children are most vulnerable, we will not get it right. All we
                will be doing is picking up newspapers — and I could name them
                and shame them because of the hyped-up nonsense they print —
                and reading about some case that catches our attention for two
                weeks, while the majority of abuse goes undetected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the end, we must accept that we will only
                ever catch a minority of abusers — I know that from my
                experience in the courts with those who have come through the
                system. The majority of abusers will go undetected. However, we
                can start to prevent further abuse by the minority of abusers
                whom we have detected. We can move in that direction when the
                guidance is put on a statutory basis. I commend Patricia Lewsley
                for tabling the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I register an interest in the debate. I am a
                voluntary youth worker, a Boys Brigade officer and a parent of
                three young children. There is a clear need to improve the
                current vetting system. As others have said, there are a small
                number of offenders on the register, and there have been several
                high-profile cases where abusers have moved across boundaries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How effective are we in liaising with other
                UK regions, never mind other European countries? How can we deal
                with offenders who use new aliases? Is our current system robust
                enough to detect such people? In the education and sporting
                worlds, non-EU citizens can become involved in training
                children. This is not an all-Ireland issue; it is an
                all-children issue. It affects all adults who train children and
                care for them. It should not be used in a political fashion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recall the child protection training that I
                received as a Boys Brigade officer. It was the first time that
                responsibility for caring for children was explained to me.
                Realisation of the legal responsibility can be quite daunting
                and off-putting to young officers. However, many people choose
                to give voluntarily and freely of their time to help children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to ensure that there is an
                effective system, and that in informing volunteers and
                professionals about the system you explain that it protects
                adults as well as children. It is important that people continue
                to give freely of their time to assist children, because many
                vulnerable children come from families that are not as well
                structured as they should be. Such children coming into contact
                with the voluntary sector can meet adults who are able to show
                care and a degree of love and support for them. It is important
                that those societal attitudes continue.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Effective vetting is needed, but the vetting
                system must also deal with the issues sensitively. A balance
                must be achieved. The need for the system should be carefully
                explained to voluntary workers but without discouraging them.
                The explanation must be given in a way that youth workers
                understand that vetting is important for their own protection
                and the protection of children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The post of children’s commissioner should
                be progressed as soon as possible. Cross-cutting is involved
                here, and someone has to take the lead. The establishment of a
                children’s commissioner will help Ministers and Departments to
                concentrate on the issue and ensure that effective measures are
                put in place as soon as possible.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that she will reply to us in writing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have stated that child protection is
                not the responsibility of any one Department; it is the
                responsibility of all Departments. I thank the Minister of
                Culture, Arts and Leisure for his attendance at the start of the
                debate, given his responsibilities for sporting events and
                after-school activities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In reply to Oliver Gibson, I did not suggest
                that an all-Ireland institution should be set up. My priority
                was to discuss the PECS register and List 99. The PECS register
                contains the names of people who have been reported to the
                Department by their employers because of their behaviour at
                work, where they have put children or adults with learning
                disabilities at risk, and the employers have indicated that they
                would be unsuitable for such work in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People may be reported for all forms of
                abuse, including sexual abuse, violence and drug-related
                matters. The problem is that PECS cannot provide the
                information. The Department of Health maintains a similar
                register for England and Wales. However, at present it is not
                possible to check that list. I hope that the Minister will take
                up the issue and that the situation will be resolved in the near
                future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also List 99, which is a UK-wide
                list drawn up by the Department for Education and Employment on
                people who are legally debarred from working in schools. Again,
                it is not possible to check that list. I hope that this is a
                temporary situation that will be resolved soon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main issue is that there are no
                equivalent registers in Scotland or the Republic of Ireland, and
                the Minister should address seriously that loophole. Members
                have repeatedly mentioned that better communication and
                co-ordination between organisations is needed. This is not a
                regional or a national issue; it is an international issue. As
                Roy Beggs said, it is a children’s issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unless there is co-ordination and
                communication across all countries, terrible paedophiles will
                continue to prey on vulnerable children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parents should be given more information on
                how to teach their children to react in difficult situations.
                The Education Committee has discussed the instructions being
                produced by the Department. The NSPCC has produced information,
                but it is not being delivered in schools, because it is about
                teaching children what is right and wrong. The aim is not to
                make children aware of what is acceptable for adults to do or
                not do to them; they need to be taught that it is wrong for
                anyone, whether they know them or not, to do certain things.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank everyone involved in the voluntary
                community sector and non-governmental organisations who work
                tirelessly in this field — an area that is often underfunded
                and under tremendous pressure. If it were not for their
                dedication and commitment to sexual abuse victims, some of the
                loopholes and gaps that exist would be much wider.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I proposed the motion so that Members would
                be made more aware of the issue. This is only the beginning; it
                is hoped that when the legislation comes before the House, many
                more issues will be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eileen Bell is correct in stating that
                children are our most precious resource; they are our future. If
                we cannot protect them when they are at their most vulnerable,
                what kind of future can we hope they will have?</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The children’s hospice ought to be a focus
                of public concern because of the tragedy concerning the issues
                involved and the unncessary nature of the dispute that has blown
                up over the past months. It would be remiss of the Assembly if,
                before it rises for the summer recess, it did not comment on the
                matter, which has been reported on in the newspapers, on radio
                and television, and has been the subject of investigation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have a responsibility to comment on
                the matter and to tell those responsible for the children’s
                hospice that it is important that they resolve the issues and
                focus on the central mission of the children’s hospice, which
                is to deliver a caring service for children who are terminally
                ill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members must be concerned about the wrangling
                that has taken place, and which has damaged the credibility of
                the children’s hospice. That wrangling has sapped the morale
                of many who for years have been quietly engaged in supporting
                the children’s hospice, raising funds and delivering a mission
                statement that will ultimately deliver a service for children
                with needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the debate will help those people
                with responsibility to focus their minds on expediting a
                solution to the crisis that has developed over some time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are four key issues. First, there has
                been a lack of management accountability concerning the children’s
                hospice. That must concern us, because this is a large charity,
                which impacts on many families. There must be accountability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, management issues have taken the
                place of the mission of the children’s hospice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, there has been a lack of
                transparency in the financial dealings of the children’s
                hospice, especially regarding the appointment and employment of
                the new chief executive. There were some questions asked about
                that matter at a members’ meeting in April, but no answers
                have been given yet. There must be financial transparency in
                order that people can have confidence in a charitable
                organisation that so many people wish to support. Many people
                are asking &quot;Why this person?&quot; &quot;What are the terms
                and conditions?&quot; &quot;Does his appointment fly in the face
                of what we have come to know as equality legislation in Northern
                Ireland?&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fourthly, there has been a total lack of
                integrity in the council’s dealings with its former director,
                Mr Tom Hill. That goes to the nub of what we are debating. Lack
                of integrity, regardless of the reason, challenges the
                credibility of the organisation and its work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The saga has more twists and turns than a
                corkscrew. This morning, the ‘News Letter’ put it quite
                vividly when it said that the story has more twists than a
                television soap opera. Soap opera scriptwriters would have some
                job delivering a saga with so many turns. However, this is not a
                farce: it is a serious matter, and it has become a tragedy for
                Northern Ireland. That is why it is important that we debate the
                issue and encourage those involved to resolve the problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the extraordinary general meeting of
                hospice members in April, several issues were identified. First,
                there was the issue of financial transparency, which I briefly
                touched on in my opening comments. The relationship of donators
                to the children’s hospice was raised, as was the chief
                executive’s financial remuneration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people will have raised their eyebrows
                when they read in this morning’s ‘News Letter’ that
                according to what was said at the April meeting, the new chief
                executive, when appointed as the director of a charity, was
                earning approximately £6,000 per month. Many people will be
                astounded at that figure, considering that the appointment does
                not appear to meet any of the criteria that we have come to
                expect under equality legislation for the appointment of
                individuals to such important posts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to make this into a personal
                issue concerning the chief executive, but the matter deserves to
                be addressed and resolved. The people who have given money to
                the organisation need to know who is being paid, how much is
                being paid and why certain amounts are being paid. That is
                crucial. It would be foolhardy of the Assembly not to know such
                facts, just as it would be foolhardy for the membership of the
                children’s hospice not to know what is really going on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also identified in April was the serious
                matter that the membership had no confidence in the board and
                called for it to step down. The vote of no confidence has not
                been recognised; it has been virtually ignored. When you have a
                board that treats its membership with contempt, you will have
                more rancour in the organisation.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who has permitted the running sore of the
                employment of the charity director, Mr Tom Hill, to become such
                a contentious issue? In the ‘News Letter’ this morning, a
                spokesperson for the children’s hospice said that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;anything which reduces the ability of
                the organisation to deliver its core services is not in the best
                interests of those who need them most.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree wholeheartedly with that statement.
                The issue of the employment of Mr Tom Hill and the way he has
                been treated is reducing the credibility and the ability of the
                organisation. It is essential that those in charge of the
                hospice face that issue and stop running away. They need to
                identify the crisis and endeavour to resolve it expeditiously.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the issue of management
                incompetence. The day after Mr Hill was sacked, I received a
                telephone call from a distraught constituent who told me that
                her office had received a fax from the solicitors acting for the
                chief executive and the council of the children’s hospice. The
                fax detailed a plan to sack an individual, and she wanted to get
                that document to me. The six- page legal document drawn up by
                solicitors acting for the council was delivered to me. It
                outlined a timetable and an efficient method for setting this
                person up for dismissal. When that was revealed, there was
                absolutely no apology for that plan of campaign. There has been
                a failure to recognise that management overstepped the mark.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document shows that Mr Hill was to be
                treated in an unfair fashion. He was to be isolated from other
                directors — how can a director do his job if he is isolated
                from his colleagues? A firewall was to be established on all
                personnel matters, in order to restrict the work of this
                director. How could you work under those circumstances? The
                document also said that the council should contemplate denying
                Mr Hill the right to attend council meetings, to which he had to
                report, and recommended making him unrecognisable as a director
                of the agency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A man of integrity lost his job through
                workings that have a patina of legality, outlining how he should
                be isolated while ignoring his well-deserved public appreciation
                and support. When there is that level of incompetence — or,
                should I say, &quot;scheming&quot;, which is worse — people
                should realise that perhaps the decision taken in April by the
                membership to call on the board to stand down, to create a clean
                slate, to allow a fresh start and to focus on the mission of the
                children’s hospice delivering a service for dying children who
                have real needs was the right one. The membership was right to
                call for the board to stand down and to allow us to focus on the
                real issue — the management of terminally ill children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, instead of dealing with the type of
                children’s hospice that Northern Ireland needs or welcoming
                the establishment of a first-class service, the pressure on the
                public and on public representatives is to discuss, read and
                hear about the management style of a board and a council. There
                is a major deficiency in that management style, and that must be
                addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the course of the election, the Member
                for South Antrim, Mr Jim Wilson, rightly called for a public
                inquiry into the matter. I support that call. In the debate, on
                the motion put down by Ms Lewsley, the issue of a children’s
                commissioner was raised. If such a commissioner is ever
                appointed, he or she should have a retrospective look at the
                matter, because it affects children who are in great need and
                who have very little time to address that need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion will, I hope, speed up the
                investigation, because to date every supposed internal check and
                balance on the accountability of the board — or lack thereof
                — has failed. An independent inquiry will address that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The management style should never have been
                an issue for the public. The delivery of a first-class service
                — the care of terminally ill youngsters — should be the key
                issue. That is what saddens most people who have had any dealing
                with this. They realise that the real issue has been forgotten
                in the subterfuge and jealous wrangling that have become the
                public debate on the children’s hospice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The credibility of the children’s hospice
                is on the block today, and those in charge of it have several
                options. I hope that they will take the first one; that they
                will adhere to the decision made in April and stand down.
                Waiting until September or October will only result in a bigger
                problem. Action is required immediately.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In closing, I pay tribute to Tom Hill for his
                tireless and thankless efforts to do something tangible for
                those in greatest need. The tragedy today is the way that his
                effort has been rewarded — or not. He did not seek
                recognition, but for him to be jettisoned because of
                professional or personal jealousy that ultimately challenges the
                credibility of the children’s hospice, is the real tragedy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So much has been achieved: over £5 million
                has been raised, a site has been delivered at a peppercorn
                purchase price by Newtonabbey Borough Council and the largest
                grant to any UK hospice has been received. The prospect of a
                state-of-the-art hospice is in front of us. So much more is at
                stake — the caring service for children in dire need. Yet all
                those things, which we should really be debating and
                encouraging, have been lost because of the management failure of
                the children’s hospice. I hope that, in some small way, the
                Assembly is able to influence those people and encourage them to
                resolve the problem now and to focus on the real mission of the
                children’s hospice.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. The Northern Ireland
                Hospice is a major contributor to Northern Ireland’s
                healthcare portfolio. It was founded 18 years ago with little
                money, two staff and an enormous vision. Today it is a
                multi-million pound organisation providing in-patient care at
                Somerton House, specialist nurses working with adults throughout
                most of Northern Ireland, an at-home service and a Province-wide
                children’s service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are, of course, looking forward to the
                opening of the Northern Ireland children’s hospice in
                September, but it is regrettable that the final stages of that
                fantastic initiative have been tainted by the management council’s
                treatment of a member of staff directly linked with the project.
                I remember when Tom Hill came to my parish church. I remember
                his vision, his passion and, especially, his cry for help.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recent months, we have all read and
                listened to media reports of the sorry affair. Shrouded in
                mystery enforced by the council, the public has been left in a
                total state of amazement as to what really happened to result in
                such a mess. There is no doubt that Tom Hill has suffered a
                great deal from the confused and bizarre handling of his case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He has made an enormous contribution to the
                realisation of the vision to create Northern Ireland’s first
                children’s hospice. Now, for reasons known only to, perhaps,
                very few, he is no longer part of that vision. Is it not time
                for the management council to come clean? Is it not time for the
                council to consider its position? In any other walk of life, a
                confidence slump such as has happened here would bring about
                resignation or sacking.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hospice is suffering financially as a
                result of the ongoing dispute. Some supporters are reluctant to
                contribute until the issues are resolved. That, coupled with the
                impact of foot-and-mouth disease on a major fund-raiser for the
                hospice, has had a devastating effect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must remember that, while all this is
                going on, patients are still being cared for. Medical and
                nursing staff are still providing the best possible care.
                Families continue to receive support at the most critical time
                in their lives. Confidence must be restored to enable the staff
                to get on with their work, for volunteers once again to feel
                proud to be associated with one of Northern Ireland’s great
                success stories and for fund-raisers and the public to
                rediscover their enthusiasm and generosity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a very difficult time. It is not a
                time to identify winners or losers. It must not be a time when
                patients are at risk of being the losers. No matter what, the
                patients and their families should always be at the top of the
                agenda, as should the doctors, the nurses and the caring staff.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The management dispute with Tom Hill is
                regrettable, but it is to be hoped that the laws of the land
                will deal with that in a correct and appropriate way. The Member
                for North Antrim, Mr Paisley Jnr, brought to our attention some
                disquieting information about what could be described as the
                &quot;questionable planning&quot; of Tom Hill’s departure. I
                am sure that we will return to that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This whole issue has identified a much bigger
                problem, which is that the Northern Ireland Hospice has outgrown
                the system of governance put in place 18 years ago. The
                day-to-day running of the hospice is under review at the moment,
                with a report due in October, but the bigger picture needs the
                same treatment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, I heard your explanation of the
                Minister’s absence, but nevertheless I am disappointed that
                she is not here. Mr Paisley Jnr referred to my recent request
                for a public inquiry, which the Minister dismissed. At the time
                I called it a &quot;cop-out&quot;, and I believe that the
                Minister did cop out. I am unhappy that she is not here today,
                but in her absence I recommend that she commission a team,
                representing a cross-section of industry, commerce and health,
                to examine the current articles of association of the hospice,
                that she appoint an independent chairperson, and that that team
                be charged with carrying out a thorough review of the overall
                management of the hospice, the role of the council and — very
                importantly — its method of selection.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also recommend that the Minister of Health
                Social Services and Public Safety review urgently her Department’s
                financial contribution to the Northern Ireland Hospice.
                Currently, that sits at 17% of its running costs, compared to
                30% in England and Wales, 50% in Scotland and, in many cases,
                100% in the Republic of Ireland. Every £2 provided by the
                Department of Health secures over ten pounds’ worth of
                palliative care. Is the Minister not morally obliged to pay the
                proper price for specialist palliative care services, which have
                been identified as essential components of the Department’s
                provision responsibilities?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These positive moves would do much to restore
                confidence in an organisation that has always enjoyed massive
                support from the public in Northern Ireland. It must continue to
                receive that support.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that the Minister will read Hansard
                in respect of the child protection motion that preceded this,
                and I hope that she will also study what has been said in the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received some information regarding Mr
                Hill’s taking his case to an industrial tribunal. While I do
                not want to curb Members unnecessarily, they must appreciate
                that if that turns out to be the case, it is conceivable that
                there could be a sub judice problem. I am just mentioning that.
                I will not give a ruling on it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. The Northern Ireland
                children’s hospice will be the first facility for children
                with terminal diseases and their families and friends. Today,
                around 50 children are dying from life- limiting illnesses. The
                children’s hospice that will be built in Newtownabbey is based
                on the Northern Ireland Hospice’s reputation for caring
                professionalism and excellent facilities. In my council area of
                Derry, the Foyle Hospice is recognised as being part of the
                fabric of the city, and the advent of the children’s hospice
                in Belfast is seen as extending the service offered both by it
                and by the Northern Ireland Hospice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The death of a child is probably the saddest
                loss that can be experienced. The mission of the children’s
                hospice will be to care for children with life-limiting diseases
                from all over Northern Ireland. It will provide help, advice and
                support for their families. Any child under 19 years of age will
                be eligible for care, and, as with all hospice services, there
                will be no charge to the family.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is significant that, following a
                competition involving 3,500 schoolchildren, the hospice will be
                named Horizon House. My understanding is that there will be
                facilities to provide often lengthy respite care for 10
                children, and also to provide for shorter admissions. Parents
                and families can be accommodated in family rooms if they wish,
                and parents and their children will be encouraged to treat the
                hospice as a home from home.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Facilities such as this should not have been
                allowed to become the focus of a public wrangle. The situation
                must be resolved quickly so that the families of children with
                terminal illnesses will at least have the consolation of knowing
                that their lives and those of their children will be made
                bearable and that pain will be eased, if not eliminated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not intend to take sides, but I agree
                that the dispute must be resolved quickly. We cannot allow the
                issue to drift — it is too serious. I support the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and thank my Colleague
                for bringing it before the House. I deeply regret that it had to
                be placed on the agenda. No one will want to glory in the fact
                that such a motion has had to be brought before the Northern
                Ireland Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The future of the Northern Ireland children’s
                hospice must not be unnecessarily compromised by the continuing
                turmoil that has surrounded the events of recent months, and
                every measure must be taken to secure an effective resolution to
                the current difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am a strong supporter of the valuable work
                that the Northern Ireland Hospice and its excellent staff have
                done and continue to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the facts surrounding this case are
                disturbing. During my time as Member of Parliament for South
                Antrim, I was inundated with calls from constituents expressing
                their deep concern about the saga of the children’s hospice.
                The issues detracted from the excellent news of the opening of a
                hospice to care for the terminally ill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The public and emotive situation of the
                Northern Ireland children’s hospice is unacceptable, not only
                to the people of south Antrim, Newtownabbey and the area where
                the hospice is, but to thousands of people across the Province.
                Ardent fund-raisers do not come only from the south Antrim area.
                People across the Province have reached out their hands to the
                organisation in the past. When it was needed, the public was
                happy to give its hard-earned money to something that it
                believed in — something that gave support to many families.
                The current situation is causing untold distress and
                uncertainty. A mass petition has been delivered to hospice
                headquarters at Somerton Road, but confusion still reigns.
                Surely that is totally unacceptable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the annual general meeting in April, 97%
                of those present supported a vote of no confidence in the
                hospice management committee. There could not be a clearer
                indication that all is not well. Many founding families confirm
                that they would not use the children’s service due to this
                distrust of the hospice council. A further meeting was
                requested, but no date for that was notified within the 21 days
                allowed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even now, the council remains undecided on
                whether Tom Hill will be permitted to appeal against his
                termination as administrative director. What sort of signal does
                that send out, not only to the local community, but to the
                community at large? The negativity and controversy flies in the
                face of the positive work that has brought the project so close
                to fruition. The realisation of the children’s hospice project
                at the O’Neill Road site will bring much relief to over 900
                life-limited children in Northern Ireland, providing an
                invaluable resource for both children and their families.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Hospice has always
                prided itself on the quality of its patient care and goodwill
                — I have commended it for that. Unfortunately, the events of
                past months have darkened the horizon. The emotional distress
                that has been caused to many families must be dispelled lest the
                Northern Ireland children’s hospice continue to suffer
                unnecessarily. The sickening saga could be resolved properly and
                speedily. Those who are involved in the decision-making process
                would do well to remember why the children’s hospice is named
                Horizon House. An important lesson can be learned from the child
                whose privilege it was to name the site.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When asked why she had selected the name
                &quot;Horizon House&quot;, Nicole Crawford replied that when the
                clouds go away, there is a bright horizon. It is a horizon that
                should bring new hope to the many families in Northern Ireland
                who will benefit from using the very special service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion allows us to highlight the causes
                of the controversy. We should bear in mind that a new horizon,
                and the hope that accompanies it, can be achieved only through
                honesty, decency and integrity in dealing with the situation.
                Those qualities have been lacking in dealings with Tom Hill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An organisation is always bigger than the
                individual. Mr Hill recognises that those issues are bigger than
                he. We must dig deep into the heart of a matter that has brought
                Tom Hill’s name to the fore.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I, and those from the South Antrim
                constituency who know him well, believe him to be a gentleman
                who has worked with great honesty, integrity and decency on
                behalf of the Northern Ireland Hospice for many years. He is a
                person of vision; he is caring and understanding to those
                families going through critical times and whose children are in
                most need of love and attention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why would any organisation plan to discredit
                Mr Hill and remove him from his position?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank my hon Friend for his intervention,
                and I concur with his remarks. I ask myself &quot;What was Tom
                Hill’s crime?&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I was a Member of Parliament for South
                Antrim I received delegations from Mr and Mrs Lynn. I can name
                them because they appeared on the ‘Spotlight’ television
                programme. They had a child who was diagnosed with terminal
                illness and who has since died. They were distraught when they
                came to see me in Ballyclare, because four different people
                representing the Northern Ireland Hospice council had, they
                believed, lied to them — in writing and face to face.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are told that Tom Hill was sacked
                primarily because of an alleged conversation in the home of Mr
                and Mrs Lynn. In spite of repeated assurances that the matter
                was dropped in July 2000, when the Lynns raised the matter in
                the ‘Spotlight’ programme, they were told that it had been
                properly and appropriately dealt with.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council refused to show the report on the
                alleged conversation in the Lynns’ home. When the Lynns
                requested a reply, they received none to their communication or
                correspondence and no reply to their phone calls. When I spoke
                to the Lynns, they told me that they had received what they
                perceived to be a threatening solicitor’s letter on behalf of
                the hospice nursing manager less than two months after Jonathan’s
                death. That shows the care and sensitivity of those handling the
                situation. A grieving, broken-hearted family that needed care
                and attention as never before seemed to be getting deeper and
                deeper into a pit. When they tried to get evidence and
                information, they were not only denied it, but they were refused
                even the courtesy of a reply.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On their behalf, I contacted the Northern
                Ireland Hospice. I received a cop-out — hardly surprising, of
                course, when I heard what Mr and Mrs Lynn said. I wanted a
                meeting to get to the bottom of this for Mr and Mrs Lynn. That
                meeting has never taken place — it was never agreed to. I
                believe that Mr McComiskey was going on holiday. It is only
                natural for people to go on holiday, but somebody must have been
                there to deal with matters in his absence. The meeting could
                have taken place when he came back; but it never has.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has been a despicable and disgraceful
                way of handling people whose hearts are broken. They were told
                that there was no reason to believe that the alleged
                conversation was part of Mr Hill’s saga, only to read that it
                was at the heart of Mr Hill’s sacking — lies and deceit. The
                truth is that the public and those paying money to the hospice
                no longer have confidence in the Northern Ireland Hospice’s
                council. Its members have offered to resign; their resignation
                should be activated immediately.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to draw one final consideration to
                Members’ attention. It will be some months before those places
                are filled after the resignations. There is a belief that
                gerrymandering is afoot. It is believed that council members
                have obtained several hundred membership forms. Postponing the
                extraordinary general meeting until a later date could give
                those resigning a better chance of being reinstated by receiving
                sufficient proxy votes to ensure re-election.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The whole saga stinks. It is breaking the
                hearts of many hard-working people who have supported the
                hospice over the years —people who love the hospice and who
                want to support it in future. Anyone who believes that the facts
                can be buried forever must think again. It is necessary to have
                an open, independent inquiry into the saga. The truth must be
                told.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I support the motion, which concerns a vexing matter. Central to
                it are the children and their families who are suffering because
                of the ongoing personality disputes in the children’s hospice.
                That diminishes the positive work and dedication of the
                professional and voluntary staff of the children’s hospice. It
                is sad that internal problems have been brought into the public
                arena in such an unseemly way, because that can only deeply
                affect the children and families who use the children’s
                hospice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You are right, a Leas Cheann Comhairle, to
                point out that a tribunal is ongoing and to remind us to be
                careful when discussing the personalities involved in the
                dispute. The debate ought not to be about personalities, but
                about the care of the young children, the vulnerable of our
                society. Anyone who has been to a hospice where adults are dying
                appreciates the trauma that is involved, and how much greater
                that trauma is when young children are dying. Our aim should be
                to attempt to resolve the issues at the centre of the unseemly
                controversy by any necessary means.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Around £1 million of public funding was
                allocated to the children’s hospice, and there is no
                legislation to regulate voluntary organisations in this part of
                Ireland. Relevant legislation should be urgently introduced,
                because we are powerless to intervene in a dispute with a
                voluntary organisation. At the moment, we can only highlight the
                central issue — the children and their families who are
                suffering. I ask those involved to disregard the personalities
                and potentially egotistic behaviour involved, to put aside their
                public posturing and to work through the circumstances
                surrounding the unseemly, hurtful public debate about suffering
                children with an independent adjudicator.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, because it gives us an
                opportunity to speak about the matter in public. We have an
                obligation and a duty to the children and their families to
                ensure that this personality issue is not allowed to diminish
                the focus on the real suffering of people at this time.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will start by emphasising the word
                &quot;tragedy&quot;, which was how Ian Paisley Jnr and Jim
                Wilson described the situation. We should regard the matter in
                that light. I am concerned about references to the concept of a
                public inquiry. Public inquiries might be good at apportioning
                blame, but I am not sure that we should be seeking to do that.
                We should seek to be a bit more neutral, and I would prefer the
                phraseology that is used in the resolution, which refers to
                seeking &quot;an early resolution&quot; of the
                difficulties.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tragedy is that so many people of
                goodwill started off working together and seeking to promote the
                needs of life-limited children, but have ended up torn asunder,
                whether as a result of personality clashes or management
                differences, in the widest term.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is leading to a tragedy for the
                potential clients of the service that the children’s hospice
                should be providing. We have heard plenty about what has
                happened in the past. Some Members have perhaps been a little
                unwise to say as much as they have. We should state the need for
                the difficulties to be resolved, rather than seek to apportion
                blame in any way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a vast number of charities in
                Northern Ireland, as there are across the UK. The time has run
                out for some of them, and they no longer exist in anything more
                than name. Some are very small and have difficulties because
                they principally operate on the basis of the goodwill of
                volunteers. Some of those we see as charities here are actually
                branches of national organisations that have firm management
                structures in place and are run in a truly professional way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without wishing to apportion blame, some
                groups of charities in Northern Ireland have the potential for
                problems. Those charities, which started out as a small number
                of people operating on the basis of goodwill with limited
                funding, have become major local bodies. They were started up
                with enthusiasm, energy and commitment to a cause — the true
                meaning of charity. They have grown over the years; they have
                been given public funds, have attracted outside funding and, in
                some cases, overseas funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those small groups of volunteers are now
                trying to run what is, in effect, a major business — employing
                staff, providing services, et cetera. In many cases the skills
                that that requires are different from the skills which people
                brought in at the beginning, such as the enthusiasm to get a
                body started. Those who find themselves in positions of much
                greater responsibility than they expected may have run into
                difficulties inadvertently. They have run into difficulties
                nevertheless, and problems arise because of it. For that reason,
                we need a body akin to the Charity Commissioners specifically
                for Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kelly was wrong to say that there is no
                legal control, but he was right to say that the Assembly has no
                control over the actions of a voluntary organisation. The
                control over charities in Northern Ireland is a minimalist one
                conveyed by Inland Revenue registration on purely financial
                matters. That is clearly inadequate to deal with the problems
                highlighted in the hospice, or which may arise in other major
                regional charities. We do not need a financial audit after
                problems have arisen. We need a body equivalent to the Charity
                Commissioners across the water; indeed, in some senses we need
                to go beyond that. We need a body that would participate in
                promoting good practice, could help to resolve difficulties and
                would ensure that this important sector of Northern Ireland
                society runs to the interests of its clients and is not riven
                with difficulties like those faced by the hospice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to see that resolution. I support the
                motion, but I urge caution in apportioning blame or in seeking a
                public inquiry, as that might merely add to the anguish that is
                being experienced.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not necessarily appropriate to take
                sides in this affair. Authorities are already in place to deal
                with this. We agree with the motion in the respect that it is
                calling for an early resolution of the issues. The only side
                that we should take is that of the children who are terminally
                ill, their families and those who have worked tirelessly to
                support them. Along with my Colleague, Mr Ford, my only
                suggestion is that consideration should be given to appointing a
                charities commission specific to Northern Ireland to deal with
                this type of issue.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I rise to support the motion as it is stated
                in the Order Paper. I do not intend to go beyond that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The row about the children’s hospice must
                be resolved. It has gone on too long and has caused untold
                anxiety to the public, especially to those who matter most —
                the children and parents who will use the hospice. When the
                problem is finally resolved, there should be a detailed inquiry
                into how it got so far out of hand and could not be resolved
                without a damaging public fracas that did no one any good, not
                least the sick children who benefit from the hospice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Charities are voluntary, but that does not
                reduce the need to abide by established codes of conduct, follow
                clearly defined procedures and have in place appeals procedures
                which are fair, fast, efficient and conclusive. On this
                occasion, the Assembly can do nothing more than take note of the
                dispute. It is not helpful to take sides, as that may entrench
                positions and exacerbate the problem. Nevertheless, much can be
                learned. For example, should a similar row break out in another
                charity, surely it would be of enormous benefit if mechanisms
                were in place to intervene to stop that dispute getting out of
                control. I am pleased that other Members have already suggested
                something similar.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The voluntary sector, and in particular the
                charitable bodies, play a critical role in providing a holistic
                and comprehensive service to those in need. The present
                incumbents in those charities have rights, but they also have
                responsibilities to ensure that the image and functions of those
                charities are not damaged by unnecessary adverse publicity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have said, I am not taking sides in the
                dispute. That is not the way forward. However, I hope that the
                matter is resolved sooner rather than later, as that would be in
                the interests of those who matter most — the children. I
                support the call for a report — not necessarily a public
                inquiry — and a debate on its findings. Never again should
                such a worthy cause be thrust into the public gaze in such a
                distressing way. Those involved in the hospice movement deserve
                better; and those who use the service most definitely deserve
                better.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now that the matter is before the Assembly,
                we should appeal to the public not to curtail its support for
                the hospice movement but to redouble its generosity. We should
                urge them to become members of the hospice movement and by doing
                so fulfil one of the most basic needs of mankind — looking
                after the sick and dying.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stress that I am not taking sides, nor does
                the motion require that. I hope that the tribunal referred to
                earlier will not be compromised by contributions made in the
                debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finishing on a lighter note — and sometimes
                we need one — surely if we in the Chamber can agree on the
                issue, the hospice movement, which is made up of people with a
                common cause of looking after the needs of very sick children,
                can resolve its differences. I know that it is not as simple as
                that. However, I am convinced that no one in this dispute had
                any evil intentions; nor did they set out to damage the hospice
                movement. However, that it is what has happened, and it must be
                resolved by legislation and procedure that will prevent it from
                happening again.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has been a worthwhile debate. I came to
                the House with a heavy heart in the knowledge that we would have
                to discuss the tragic happenings surrounding the management of
                the children’s hospice and how it has taken the limelight from
                the real issue — the mission of the hospice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the serious contributions from
                those supporting the motion. I do not want to anticipate the
                House’s unanimous support, although I would welcome that. The
                management of the children’s hospice is a tangled mess, but
                this debate ends on a positive note. The House calls on those
                who have responsibility to take responsibility and resolve the
                problems. Surely that is what this debate has been about. We
                should not have had to debate it in a public arena, but we would
                have been remiss in our duty had we not shown our interest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the comments of many Members, and I
                shall refer to them briefly. Jim Wilson said that the hospice
                offers a fantastic opportunity, and I agree with him. Everyone
                can say a hearty &quot;hear, hear&quot; to that. We want a
                state-of-the-art facility for people in real need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is, however, a slump in confidence in
                how this has been managed, and the debate has focused on that.
                It was addressed competently by most Members who spoke. The
                debate issues a challenge to those in charge of the children’s
                hospice: who runs the hospice, and how should it be managed in
                future? I hope that that challenge is met, because it is clear
                that there must be a clearing of the decks. The previous
                management style has not worked. If it had worked, we would not
                be debating it today. That is the reality. Let us clear the
                decks and allow a new, more professional management team to
                organise the affairs of this very noble charity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome Mrs Courtney’s comments and those
                of my Colleague, Mr McCrea. They echoed similar sentiments,
                which rightly focused on the real victims — the children and
                their needs and on the urgent, immediate, centred, even selfish,
                support that these youngsters require. I hope that we can leave
                this debate behind and focus on the real issues, just as we
                should encourage the hospice management to resolve its problems
                so that it too can focus wholeheartedly on those issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCrea said that the heart of the issue
                was the sacking of the director. When I first read about the
                matter, the term &quot;gross misconduct&quot; struck my eye.
                That phrase can send out the wrong message if people do not know
                what it means. Mud thrown in this society sticks. One finds out,
                however, that the &quot;misconduct&quot; appears to have been an
                innocent conversation. This conversation was between a husband
                and wife who have been involved with the idea of the children’s
                hospice before there ever was one and who have been involved all
                their professional lives in caring for terminally ill children.
                That such &quot;misconduct&quot; is used against the director is
                a sad reflection, not on the director, but on those who work
                against him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House ought to express its resentment at
                how that has been used by those in charge of the tangled mess.
                No one has disputed what I said at the beginning of the debate
                — that there are four key issues: the general lack of
                accountability of the hospice; the management issues that have
                taken the focus off the mission statement; the lack of financial
                transparency; and the lack of integrity in dealing with an
                employee. These have not been disputed; I welcome that and
                believe that the House supports those issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also believe the words of the PR agent for
                the children’s hospice, who in today’s ‘News Letter’
                said that anything that reduces the ability of the organisation
                to deliver its core services is not in the best interests of
                those who need them. If the management style reduces the ability
                to deliver the core services of the children’s hospice, the
                person who made that statement should present it to her bosses
                this morning and say to them &quot;It is your style that is
                reducing the ability of our organisation&quot;. The House should
                support that call. The matter must be resolved expeditiously. It
                is not good enough to wait until the autumn. It has to be
                resolved, and resolved now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kelly, the Sinn Féin Member for Mid
                Ulster, was wrong to tell the House that we are powerless to do
                anything about this. We certainly are not. The Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety is not powerless; it
                could have held an inquiry. If it had held an inquiry when one
                was first asked for, or even if it had had the imagination to
                pre-empt those calls by holding an inquiry when the issue raised
                its head some 18 months ago, we might not be in this situation
                today. We are not powerless; let us not pretend that we have no
                responsibility here. As public representatives, of course we
                have a responsibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us remember that the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety has to account to the
                taxpayer for how much of its money it has allocated to this
                project and why. We do have power on this issue. We should not
                forget that, and we should not let those in charge of the issue
                forget it. The Minister could help, and the Department could
                investigate the issue and look at the series of problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford agreed with Mr Jim Wilson and me that
                this whole saga has been a tragedy and that it could be resolved
                by those people who are currently in charge of it. I have gone
                further than that: ministerial or departmental direction or
                advice to the management could have changed the structures
                rapidly to stop the situation getting out of control.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I say to Mr Ford and Ms Morrice that there
                comes a time in the affairs of man when we cannot sit on the
                fence, when we have to stand up and be counted on an issue.
                There comes a time when we have to say, not that we are taking
                sides on an issue, but that we are taking the side of what is
                right for children. We have a choice between what is patently
                right and the actions that have been taken, which have been
                blatantly wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House is not playing the blame game
                today. We are quite deliberately highlighting our interest in
                the issue and warning those people who have the responsibility
                to get on with the job to sort this mess out or else we will
                have the power, and the duty, to step in.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I therefore commend the motion to the House
                and repeat my earlier tribute to the work and the tenacity of
                Tom Hill in the face of the unacceptable pressures on him. I
                hope that the House will, in some way, send out a signal today
                to all those involved, telling them to hurry up and resolve this
                terrible, tasteless dispute that we have had to sample over the
                last few months. I commend the motion.</p>
