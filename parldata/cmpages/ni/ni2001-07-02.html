                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 8 May 2001, as the House will be aware, I
                received a sealed letter from the then First Minister and a
                covering note in which he asked me to open and implement the
                sealed letter by the end of 30 June, unless I received a letter
                of revocation. I received no revoking letter. I opened the
                sealed letter as requested, and I wish to report to the House
                that Mr Trimble resigned as First Minister in a letter dated 1
                July 2001.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to try to clarify the situation
                for Members. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 applies. Under
                section 16(7)(a) the Deputy First Minister, Mr Séamus Mallon,
                also ceased to hold office but may continue to exercise the
                functions of his office until the election of a new First
                Minister and a new Deputy First Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 29 June I received a letter from the then
                First Minister, Mr Trimble, notifying me that under section
                16(5)(b) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 he had designated Sir
                Reg Empey to exercise the functions of the office of First
                Minister during the period of the vacancy. Section 16(8) of the
                Northern Ireland Act 1998 states that an election shall be held
                to fill the vacancies of First Minister and Deputy First
                Minister within a period of six weeks, that is, by 11 August.
                While no date has as yet been set, I will, of course, keep
                Members informed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Séamus Mallon has requested leave, which
                I have granted, to make a personal statement on the matter of
                his ceasing to hold office as the Deputy First Minister.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I would like
                to have a matter placed on record. On a previous occasion —
                though under different Standing Orders — what everyone
                believed to have been a resignation from the Deputy First
                Minister later transpired not to be a resignation. Would you
                clarify that you consider this resignation to be a resignation
                within the terms of the legislation, and, therefore, before
                anybody else can carry out the First Minister’s and Deputy
                First Minister’s functions as First Minister and Deputy First
                Minister, an election by the Assembly under the terms of the
                legislation will be required?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is correct that a circumstance
                arose, under different Standing Orders, where there was some
                confusion. On this occasion I see no possibility of any
                confusion. The resignation has been committed to me in writing;
                it is dated; I have announced it to the House; it is clear and
                in order; and the Northern Ireland Act 1998 applies. I trust
                that that confirms the matter to the satisfaction of the Member
                and the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McClarty:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Now that you
                have confirmed that the First Minister has resigned due to the
                failure of Sinn Féin/IRA to honour its word and commence
                decommissioning, can you confirm that under section 30 of the
                Northern Ireland Act 1998 both Governments may exclude a
                political party if that party is in default? Furthermore, now
                that Gen de Chastelain has confirmed that the IRA has broken its
                word, is it not the case, under the legislation and Standing
                Orders, that the Assembly has only six weeks left to run and,
                therefore, the blame for any breakdown in the process lies
                squarely at the door of Sinn Féin/IRA, which has consistently
                broken its word?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can only refer to the procedural elements
                of the Member’s comments. In relation to what the two
                Governments may choose to do, there is relatively little limit
                on what they may do legally. They can take actions within the
                limits of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. However, they may also
                take legislation through their respective Parliaments. It is not
                for me to rule on any legal limits. As far as the political
                limits are concerned, that is not a matter for me at all.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I wish
                clarification of your ruling. I understand that you received a
                letter on 29 June in which the former First Minister designated
                another Minister to exercise his functions as First Minister. Am
                I right in saying that at the date of that letter, when those
                functions were designated, no vacancy existed in the office of
                First Minister — that vacancy not arising until 30 June? In
                those circumstances was that designation properly made?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The terms of the letter were such that the
                nomination was to take place</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;during any vacancy in that office&quot;

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have looked at the matter, and it is hard
                to visualise any reason — other than the current circumstances
                — for Parliament having voted that the clause stand part of
                the Bill. It does not seem to me that there are any other
                circumstances where that subsection could apply. Therefore the
                matter is in order.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker.
                Is it your ruling that a First Minister or Deputy First Minister
                can make a conditional appointment of a Minister to discharge
                his functions — conditional in the sense that that appointment
                is not to take place until the happening of an event which may
                or may not take place? In this case, Minister Empey was
                appointed to discharge the functions of the First Minister, but
                only in the event of the First Minister not having revoked his
                resignation — a resignation which had not at that time taken
                effect. Mr Speaker, the effect of that is to introduce an
                element of Lewis Carroll or ‘Alice in Wonderland’ to the
                procedures of the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Member will know, this power comes
                under section 16(5)(b). However, let us look at section 16(5)(a)
                which says that it may also be done</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;during any absence or incapacity of the
                holder&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, if it were to arise that the First
                Minister or Deputy First Minister was to go into hospital for an
                operation perhaps —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Or become temporarily insane.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Or perhaps not temporarily.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a circumstance where it might be wise
                for a number of people to consult with the Speaker.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us assume a circumstance where the First
                Minister or the Deputy First Minister had sufficient insight
                into an upcoming possible incapacity — for instance, going
                into hospital for an operation. He might therefore designate
                another Minister to fulfil the functions of the office. It is
                clear that that is the purpose of section 16(5)(a). However, it
                is not unknown these days — and I say this with due respect to
                the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety —
                for operations to be unaccountably postponed. In advance of
                becoming indisposed — and this is where the question of mental
                incapacity does not bear — the First Minister or Deputy First
                Minister would have to make arrangements for his period of
                incapacity. Those arrangements would be conditional on the
                incapacity taking place, that is to say the operation
                proceeding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to both section 16(5)(a) and
                section 16(5)(b), which is the one to which the Member refers,
                it is only where the First Minister or the Deputy First Minister
                knew the probability of a matter of this kind arising — but
                never the certainty about what the future might hold, for that
                is something none of us can know, least of all Members — that
                he could make a nomination of this kind. It seems to me that it
                is in order. I cannot see that there would be any purpose in
                Parliament voting for this subsection unless this particular
                context was envisioned.</p>

                not here, but his nominated caretaker is not here either.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to establish precisely on
                what legislative basis Mr Empey is being nominated as a
                caretaker. As you well know, Mr Speaker, Mr Trimble was recently
                declared to be acting unlawfully in respect of his actions in
                relation to the North/South Ministerial Council attendance of
                Bairbre de Brún and Martin McGuinness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Mr Empey does attend here and is nominated
                and accepted as a caretaker, what will be his position in
                respect of the unlawful action carried out by Mr Trimble? As the
                caretaker designated by Mr Trimble, will he be carrying on the
                same unlawful actions? It is important that the House be
                informed of the precise terms under which Mr Empey is being
                nominated as a caretaker.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the Speaker’s point of view, the terms
                under which the nomination has been made are the legal terms of
                the Northern Ireland Act 1998. I cannot enlighten the Member or
                the House on whether there are any political terms that exist
                between Mr Trimble and Sir Reg Empey.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part of the purpose for the inclusion in the
                1998 Act of the possibility of nominating a person either in
                respect of section 16(5)(a) or (b) is so that nominations to
                North/South Ministerial Council meetings and the chairing of
                Executive meetings and so on can continue. Those are some of the
                functions of the offices that could not be continued by only one
                person, or certainly not if neither of the offices had anyone to
                fulfil or exercise its functions. The Member will have to seek
                clarification from others on the specific question to which he
                addresses himself. I can only clarify the legal and technical
                aspects of it.</p>

                The reason that I was addressing the question to you was that Mr
                Trimble and the person that he has nominated are not here. The
                House is entitled to an explanation. It is not simply a question
                of a political arrangement between Mr Trimble and Mr Empey; it
                is about the Pledge of Office. The First Minister was found to
                be unlawful in his actions. It is important that we get
                clarification on this matter from you, Mr Speaker.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to understand that the limits
                on what the Speaker can rule on are those aspects of the law and
                Standing Orders that apply to the running of the House. They do
                not apply to the operation of the Executive as an Executive,
                which is outside my remit. Therefore I cannot respond in that
                regard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that the Member and some of his
                Colleagues have taken the matter to court for resolution, they
                have made it clear that their understanding is that such matters
                must be addressed by due process through the court rather than
                through a ruling by the Speaker. His Colleagues, having taken
                the matter to court, have recognised that it is outwith my
                authority to rule on that matter.</p>

                to the failure of Sinn Féin/IRA to begin the process of
                decommissioning, can you also confirm to the House that both DUP

                resignation. I can simply confirm the fact that he has done so.
                The only other matter that I can confirm at this point — and I
                have already done so — is that, as required by law, the Deputy
                First Minister is no longer in office but continues to exercise
                the functions of that office, as the nominee, Sir Reg Empey,
                fulfils the functions of the office of First Minister.</p>

                Minister and no acting Deputy First Minister, but that there is
                a former Deputy First Minister, who may fulfil functions of the
                office of Deputy First Minister for a period of up to six weeks,
                and that there is a Minister from the Ulster Unionist Party who
                is carrying out the functions of the First Minister for that
                same period?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, Mr Speaker, perhaps you did not get
                the particular point that Mr McClarty made in raising his point
                of order. He was asking you to look at section 30 of the
                Northern Ireland Act 1998 and, in particular, at that subsection
                which allows the Secretary of State to put forward to you a
                notice requiring you to move a motion for the exclusion of a
                Minister, Ministers or a party. Can you confirm that Mr McClarty
                is wrong if he assumes that the Secretary of State himself can
                do the excluding?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can you confirm that the Secretary of State
                can ask you only to put the motion before the Assembly and that
                it would be the Assembly Members who would have to exclude and,
                therefore, that when the then Deputy First Minister indicated on
                radio yesterday that this was a path that the Secretary of State
                should follow, he must logically have been indicating a
                willingness, if the Secretary of State were to do it, for
                himself, along with his party, to support such a proposition
                during any discussion and debate that would take place?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has raised two or three questions,
                some of which I can respond to from the Chair. However, some of
                them require the views of Mr Mallon, and it would therefore be
                appropriate, as soon as possible, to give him an opportunity to
                say what his stance will be on this matter. I can simply say
                that it would be in order for him to continue to fulfil or
                exercise the functions of the office. On whether that is what he
                will choose to do, the Assembly must wait to hear what Mr Mallon
                says.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the comments on Mr McClarty’s
                point of order, I do try to respond directly to the questions
                that Assembly Members raise — which, I will admit, is a
                somewhat unusual discipline for a politician. The question
                raised by Mr McClarty was whether the two Governments could
                exclude, not whether a resolution of this House might exclude. I
                made the response, as the House will recall, that the two
                Governments have the ball at their toes, in that they can put
                through whatever legislation they choose.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the current legislation, on
                which the Assembly is founded, it is clear that exclusions take
                place by a vote of the House. That is the current situation. I
                cannot speak about whether the Governments will choose to do
                something different. If the Member refers to section 30 of the
                Northern Ireland Act 1998, I can see nothing there that permits
                the Secretary of State to make an exclusion — it merely
                provides that he, as one of a number, may propose an exclusion.
                Members are familiar with that resolution procedure. Those
                matters should by now be relatively clear, and perhaps we can
                now move on to Mr Mallon’s personal statement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Leaders of parties, or their nominees, will
                have a chance to make a brief statement in response if they
                choose.</p>

                that the proposed Deputy First Minister is not here, how is the
                Assembly to know whether he is prepared to take up his duties?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The terminology is important. There is
                neither a proposed Deputy First Minister, nor a proposed First
                Minister, but simply a current Minister who is able to exercise
                the functions of those posts. It is not for me to determine.
                However, it should be clear — and this relates to an earlier
                point of order — that if the Member were not prepared to
                exercise the functions, it is now no longer possible for anyone
                else to be nominated. Does the Member wish to follow that point
                of order?</p>

                the authority with which I made my remarks and gave my opinion.
                The Minister has been appointed in writing, and if he chooses
                not to take up that appointment, I must be notified in writing,
                otherwise the appointment stands.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that the House will give Mr Mallon
                the opportunity to make his personal statement.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Mallon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, I thank you for your permission
                to make a personal statement. I confirm that I did consult you
                — that is not, I hope, any reflection on my mental state of
                health — so that I could act in accordance with your guidance
                on personal statements. I make this statement out of respect
                for, and courtesy to, the Assembly. It is important that I
                clarify the situation as I see it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following the resignation of Mr Trimble, I no
                longer hold the office of Deputy First Minister. However, as the
                legislation provides, I will continue to exercise the functions
                of Deputy First Minister in the coming weeks to try to sustain
                the workings of the institutions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the real contribution that Mr
                Trimble has made since devolution. However, I regret that he has
                chosen this time to precipitate this latest in a long series of
                crises. For the past three years I have witnessed with sadness a
                variety of efforts to hold the political process to ransom.
                Failure to commence devolution was matched, and has now been
                long and shamefully outlived, by failure to commence putting
                arms beyond use.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The blatant unwillingness of DUP Ministers to
                undertake the basic responsibility of ministerial office has
                been paralleled by deliberate efforts to wreck a carefully
                constructed institutional balance, particularly through a
                refusal to nominate Sinn Féin Ministers to the North/ South
                Ministerial Council. That the process remains — in difficulty
                but intact — reflects the fact that the agreement is owned not
                by politicians but by the people of Ireland, North and South,
                who overwhelmingly endorsed it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our duty is to the people we serve and,
                through them, to the agreement that they democratically
                endorsed. Every crisis and every interruption to the work of the
                institutions weakens our capacity to fulfil that duty. With
                duties come rights. As Deputy First Minister, I have worked to
                protect the rights of all. However, some want rights without
                responsibility. Some have not met their responsibilities under
                the agreement. In particular, three years and one day after this
                Assembly first met, weapons have still not been put beyond use
                by Republican or Loyalist paramilitaries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin demands respect for its democratic
                mandate. I respect that democratic mandate. However, if Sinn
                Féin’s best endeavours to put weapons beyond use have borne
                so little fruit, it is clear that the IRA does not respect that
                mandate and the obligations that go with it.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The process that we are involved in should be
                about the legislative implementation of the agreement, but we
                have seen a succession of demands by Republicans and
                counter-demands by Unionists that go beyond it. Side letters
                have been written, and a series of secret deals have been
                entered into, to the detriment of the political process as a
                whole. Even so, they are never enough for either side.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No doubt, as we speak, further wish lists are
                in place or are under preparation for the next round of
                negotiations. The politics of demand for concessions needs to be
                overtaken by the politics of delivery on commitments made:
                delivery on putting arms beyond use, delivery on policing and
                delivery on the full and inclusive operation of the
                institutions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should all remember that the agreement is
                the only way that we can deliver a better future. It has already
                started to do so as regards enhanced provision for equality and
                human rights. We have developed a political consensus in the
                Executive and in the Assembly that has produced the first
                home-grown Programme for Government for over 30 years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On this island we have better co-operation
                and shared actions under the North/South institutions that work
                for the benefit of the people of Ireland, both North and South.
                We have made progress in promoting investment and employment for
                people in the North of Ireland. Cynical party advantage must not
                be allowed to threaten the agreement, which was based on a
                collective understanding that mutual and diverse interests had
                to be recognised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a personal statement, but the events
                that led to today have meant that I have ranged more widely than
                I perhaps should have. By continuing to exercise the functions
                of the Deputy First Minister, I will show my commitment to the
                full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. I will work
                with Reg Empey and other Colleagues in the coming weeks. My
                challenge to those who claim to want the full implementation of
                the agreement is to act in a manner designed to secure that

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of Ulster Unionist Members, I thank
                the acting Deputy First Minister for his personal statement. It
                was measured and reasonable in the circumstances. He mentioned
                the timing of the resignation of the First Minister. The timing
                was not of Mr Trimble’s choice. The date was settled by the
                decision of the IRA that it would put arms beyond use by 30 June
                this year. That was the deadline, which the former First
                Minister accepted. If that event, which was well articulated by
                the acting Deputy First Minister — the putting of illegal arms
                beyond use in a way that gained the confidence of the people of
                Northern Ireland — did not occur, then the First Minister
                would resign. That was the timing of it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Mallon for his tribute to the
                former First Minister’s contribution to making the Assembly a
                success and to the time and effort put in by Mr Trimble into the
                working of the Assembly and its Executive. On occasions like
                this we appreciate recognition being placed on the record, and I
                thank Mr Mallon for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is now in a serious
                situation. We have ahead of us six weeks of difficult political
                timing. We need to have more negotiations, and the Ulster
                Unionist Party is committed to trying to ensure that the Belfast
                Agreement is implemented in full. That means putting all illegal
                firearms and arsenals beyond use by all illegal groupings. That
                has always been our objective, and we will work towards that. We
                hope that it may begin in the next six weeks. If so, progress
                will be made in Northern Ireland. If not, however, the next
                stage in political developments will be to consider the
                exclusion from the Executive of those parties who are linked
                with paramilitary groups that still retain their firearms and
                bombs, irrespective of the desire of the people of Northern
                Ireland as stated in the Belfast Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today we have to confirm that the people of
                Northern Ireland welcome the Belfast Agreement and what has so
                far come from it. We have greater peace in Northern Ireland than
                we have had for many years. There are improved relations between
                the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and between the
                Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. Those are all steps
                forward, but the job is not finished. The people want us to
                finish it. I hope that developments in the next six weeks will
                make it possible for the Assembly to continue. If not, however,
                the Ulster Unionist Party’s position will be that one party
                will have to be excluded from the Executive of the Assembly.
                That reality must be faced.</p>

                giving general advice.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful that you have protected my
                sensitivities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to bring the House back down to earth.
                The present circumstances have been brought about because the
                agreement contained the seeds of its own destruction. Even
                though the House and its Members have refused to face up to that
                reality, it has now been unavoidably brought before them by the
                overwhelming vote of the Unionist electorate in recent
                elections.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as Mr Mallon’s comments about my
                party are concerned, let me make it clear that my party acted
                wholly in accordance with its Assembly mandate. Its Ministers
                acted in accordance with the mandate they received from the
                people and which has recently been endorsed by the people.
                Furthermore, I agree with Mr Taylor that the only way to advance
                our present circumstances is for a motion to be put forward to
                exclude Sinn Féin/IRA from the Executive. I had hoped —
                although he appeared to neglect to comment on it — that the
                outgoing Deputy First Minister was going to advance the comments
                he made on radio that he was looking to the Government to put
                forward in this Assembly a resolution to consider that matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member mean that if a resolution
                which was not promoted initially by Unionists were brought
                before the Assembly, he would be prepared to consider it if Her
                Majesty’s Government believed there to be no alternative?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If that is the case, I suspect that the
                earlier Her Majesty’s Government advises you of their
                intention to act under article 30 the better. Until Sinn
                Féin/IRA is removed from Government, the Executive will not
                follow the principle that only those who believe in democratic
                and peaceful ways forward can be members of it. While the
                Provisional IRA holds on to its weapons and keeps its terror
                machine intact, its partner, Sinn Féin, is not entitled to be
                part of the democratic process — never mind being part of
                Government. Until that moment arrives, Sinn Féin does not have
                a democratic mandate; it has a mandate to do wrong that should
                not be recognised democratically.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge those who have left office to
                recognise that the only way forward is the way stated clearly by
                the Unionist electorate in the recent election, and to act in
                accordance with that principle: only those who are exclusively
                committed to peaceful and democratic means can be part of an
                Executive in Northern Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Member’s comments may have led to
                some uncertainty, allow me to clarify that a personal statement
                does not carry with it the opportunity to respond at the end to

                linn agus rinne sé ráiteas pearsanta. Níl an fear eile, David
                Trimble, anseo agus níl Reg Empey anseo. Níl ráiteas de
                shaghas ar bith againn ón bheirt sin. Rinne an tUasal Mallon a
                dhícheall ina phost mar Leas-Chéad- Aire. Ní aontaím leis
                faoi gach aon rud a ndearna sé ach sílim féin go ndearna sé
                a dhícheall sa phost sin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Mallon for being here today and
                for making a personal statement. The outgoing First Minister and
                Reg Empey are not here; therefore, we cannot debate any of these
                issues with them. The Sinn Féin Chief Whip has been in contact
                with the other Whips to try to arrange a proper emergency debate
                on these matters as soon as possible. It is hoped that that will
                happen quickly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I pay tribute to the former Deputy First
                Minister for the way that he did his job. I do not agree with
                much of what he said earlier, but I think that he did his best,
                in a difficult position, to discharge his functions with
                fairness and balance. He took issue with the IRA on the question
                of weapons: that is fair enough. That matter is between him and
                the IRA. However, the Member also accused Republicans of making
                demands that are beyond the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can tell the House that as a party to the
                agreement I kept Mr Mallon’s party fully aware of any
                negotiations that I was involved in that perhaps Mr Mallon
                inadvertently was not involved in. There are many vexed issues.
                It is important to point out that each party has equal
                responsibility for these matters. No party can stand aside or
                above it, or try to dole out specific responsibilities to
                different parties. We all have an equal responsibility.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Taylor, or indeed his Colleagues in the
                DUP, will threaten to exclude parties from the Executive over
                the weapons issue. I am sure that the former Deputy First
                Minister will agree that there is no basis for doing that. One
                of the problems that has put us in this position is the policy
                of exclusion which still underpins the current Unionist
                leadership’s position. What is all this about? This is about a
                crisis that the First Minister planned and announced last
                October in order to bring about the suspension of the
                institutions and to put the blame on Republicans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most important point to be made is that
                the current leaders of the UUP and the DUP are not prepared to
                live on the basis of equality with their Nationalist neighbours.
                They are not prepared to participate in creating dispensations
                that are based on equity, justice and equality. I know that that
                view does not represent the feelings of many Unionists with whom
                I work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where does the threat to the peace process
                and to the political institutions come from? The threat comes
                from First Ministers who behave unlawfully and then walk away
                from their responsibilities. The threat comes from Loyalists who
                on a daily basis use guns to shoot Catholics and use pipe bombs
                and blast bombs to attack their Catholic neighbours. Those
                people who are heckling me now are pitifully silent on those
                issues. The threat also comes from within the British system
                itself, from those who want to return to the old days.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are in a crisis. The British and Irish
                Governments must accept the fact that those of us who live in
                this part of Ireland are no longer prepared to have our rights
                and entitlements filtered through a prism of Unionism. The
                British Prime Minister currently has jurisdiction over this part
                of Ireland. Therefore, he and the Taoiseach have a
                responsibility to move ahead with all aspects of the agreement
                that they are obliged and able to deal with.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is right that every party in the Chamber
                should begin by paying tribute to the work that Mr Trimble has
                done over the past five to six years. We can all recognise the
                way in which he took his party forward and participated in the
                talks process. The way in which Mr Trimble led his party into
                this institution has taken the party further forward than any of
                his predecessors have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can understand the frustrations that Mr
                Trimble experienced in recent years. There is no doubt that the
                failure of Loyalists and Republicans to live up to their
                obligations to remove arms and put them beyond use has created
                enormous difficulties. Of course, that has not been the only
                difficulty. Unionists perceived that the SDLP refused to move on
                the issue of policing, and that has been equally difficult to
                deal with. Others can point the finger back at Unionists for
                their actions. Although I still believe that the agreement has
                brought this society closer to peace, one has only to listen to
                the comments in the Chamber this morning to know that we are
                every bit as far away from reconciliation as we ever were.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble’s resignation may be
                understandable because of his frustration. However, there is no
                doubt that that has been deeply destabilising to the entire
                process. There is no way that we can make progress as a
                political society in Northern Ireland unless we operate on the
                basis that parties must meet as equals around a negotiating
                table. The unilateral ultimatum, whatever its concerns may have
                been, merely appears to others to be a way for the UUP to work
                out its fears about the electoral process. It did not appear to
                be a real attempt to get the process working.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can take some heart from Mr Mallon’s
                earlier comments in which he seemed to suggest that the way is
                now open for a proper and truly collective approach to getting
                the process working again. It is up to the two Governments to
                convene that process, but it is also up to each party to play
                its part in bringing that process forward openly and honestly.
                We should all look to ourselves, as well as to others, to firmly
                live up to the obligations that we undertook in the agreement.</p>

                decommissioning, peace, stability and reconciliation in the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble and the Prime Minister presented
                the Belfast Agreement for endorsement by the electorate on the
                basis that those who were fronting organisations inextricably

                question of just how much store we can set by Mr Trimble’s
                resignation. There is a riddle in Northern Ireland: when is a
                resignation not a resignation? When it is delivered by Mr
                Trimble or Mr Mallon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the coming weeks, no doubt, there will
                be some attempt by Her Majesty’s Government and the parties to
                the agreement to cook up another load of fudge to get around
                this difficult and thorny issue of decommissioning. People in
                Northern Ireland know that Mr Adams and his cohorts in Sinn
                Féin/IRA will never hand over one gun or one ounce of Semtex,
                because they have made it clear throughout the process that it
                is not their intention to do so. They have made clear their
                belief that they are legitimately entitled to hold those
                weapons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is rather peculiar to witness the Dublin
                Government’s antics, its road-to-Damascus experience, and Mr
                Mallon’s crocodile tears as they watch Mr Adams and his
                cohorts inflict severe damage on their political set-up. Mr
                Mallon and the SDLP have the most to be ashamed of. When Mr
                Adams and his cohorts were holed up in west Belfast, in an
                organisation that was staring defeat in the teeth as a result of
                the gallant efforts of the RUC and the Army, Mr Mallon, Mr Hume
                and their colleagues breathed life into them through the
                Hume/Adams talks that brought about this sordid mess which we
                now call the &quot;peace process&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will be no loss should the Executive
                collapse. In Northern Ireland we need — and Unionists need it
                very quickly — the ability to present people here with the
                chance to see proper democratic institutions replace this sorry
                farce. I look forward to the day when Northern Ireland has
                proper institutions which are not corrupted and polluted by
                people sitting in Government who are inextricably linked to
                terror.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the efforts made by Mr Trimble.
                He acted against a very difficult backdrop, and we have all been
                aware of those circumstances for a very long time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He did something that was unbelievable in the
                context of the Northern Ireland in which I grew up. He did it
                against a backdrop of bitterness and anger, not from those he
                had to negotiate against, but from those on whose behalf he was
                negotiating.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We watch Macedonia, Sri Lanka and other areas
                of conflict on our televisions and wish — indeed pray — that
                they will find peace. However, we seem to luxuriate in the
                brutal bitterness into which generations of our children are
                born, and we use morality as a comfort blanket. People may well
                continue to espouse the theories and opinions espoused by those
                who ran away from the negotiation process, when Mr Trimble had
                — to use an Americanism — the cojones to stay.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are now faced with choices. Whether Mr
                Trimble made the right or wrong decision is, from this point on,
                neither here nor there. We are undoubtedly in a crisis: anything
                dated 1 July in Northern Ireland is bound to herald a crisis.
                However, out of the crisis may come opportunity. Those of us who
                were prepared — and proud — to take a step forward and
                negotiate the Good Friday Agreement walked away from each other
                when we came out of Castle Buildings. We said goodbye to each
                other, but we did not have in place a process to implement the
                Good Friday Agreement. If any leader is in trouble, the process
                of peace and politics is in trouble. Rather than lean on each
                other like the tent poles of a wigwam, all of which will fall if
                one is taken away, we ran off to our respective constituencies
                trying to sell parameters for functioning that were mutually
                exclusive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of decommissioning was created by
                Unionism and the British Government to try to understand the
                intent. Having stepped forward and shown readiness to negotiate,
                they legitimately asked &quot;Are these people genuine, are they
                real? Can it be that our society might find a way to live with
                itself? If it is true, I must know in my heart that it is
                true.&quot; They picked the wrong subject. They were saying
                &quot;Give me 100% of your guns. No? Well, give me 90% or 50% or
                20% or 5%.&quot; I am convinced that if the IRA were to place 5%
                of its weapons here before you, Mr Speaker, those people would
                accept that, even though 95% of the guns could still be used.
                Indeed, with the help of a productivity manager, the IRA could
                even get more than 100% effect from them. I would have preferred
                it if the question had been one of appreciating whether the IRA’s
                ideology fitted the new dispensation. There has been no public,
                unequivocal statement of that. That is why we are in the trouble
                that we are in now. Unionists worry that the Rolls Royce of
                terrorist machines has laid down its weapons to follow its
                political path but is still wedded to those weapons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What would have been a better subject? Mr
                Trimble could have argued — and Mr Mallon could have assisted
                him — that the IRA needed to tell the world that the war was
                over. I have argued for that. That would have made a difference
                to Unionists. A curtain should have been brought down on the
                past, without the need for inquiries that by their very nature
                are one-sided. The Unionist people, among whom I live, are in
                serious dismay. I have watched Republicanism — even
                Nationalism — luxuriate in that dismay.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will return to the theory that if one
                leader in the peace process is in trouble, we are all in
                trouble. It should not be forgotten that the one group which
                increased the expectation that IRA weapons would be put beyond
                use was the IRA itself. The IRA made a statement, and it was
                assisted by Sinn Féin in giving an explanation of it. However,
                no one explained the caveat included in that statement that
                decommissioning would be carried out in the context of the
                removal of the causes of conflict. The only cause of conflict
                that I have ever heard expressed by the IRA has been &quot;Brits
                out&quot;. Explanation and understanding is needed; either the
                guns are over or the war is over.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also regret that on such a warm and
                beautiful day we have to come in here to such a cold and dismal
                atmosphere. I regret that the Deputy First Minister had to make
                today’s personal statement and that our First Minister has
                tendered his resignation. Those two posts are interdependent,
                and we will not resolve this problem until we acknowledge our
                interdependency. It is time to stop bringing problems to the
                table and to start bringing solutions. It is probable that we
                would never have reached an agreement in the first place had we
                continued to bring problems to the table.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On occasions such as this, a partnership
                might have been more effective than a plan. We have a good plan
                but, as Mr Ervine said, we lost the partnerships that helped to
                create that plan. Over the next few weeks we need to recommit
                ourselves to full-time negotiations. This is not a part-time
                peace process; it requires full-time dedication to what should
                be inclusive round-table negotiations. There should be no
                discovery afterwards of side deals that were agreed when the
                rest of us were not present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is partly the reason for our present
                situation. Had the process been slightly more transparent and
                accountable, we might not be in this crisis. However, we have
                been here before, so perhaps we can again get through this
                process of crisis management to achieve conflict transformation
                and one day soon — but it does take time — conflict
                resolution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the next few weeks it would be useful to
                agree a definition of normalisation, because although we all
                speak English, each of us needs a translation of the term. If
                normalisation consists of demilitarisation, it also consists of
                taking arms out of use and putting them beyond use. If we are to
                speak about a normalised society, we must all agree a definition
                of law and order. Not only have we not yet dealt with that
                problem, we have neither defined nor named it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have perhaps a final opportunity over the
                next few weeks not only to confront and challenge each other
                about how to resolve that problem but to support each other in
                finally putting back in place the plan and the partnerships.</p>

                Mr Mallon’s personal statement have oscillated between utter
                hypocrisy and total farce. Political representatives of some of
                the most murderous terrorist organisations made contributions as
                if they were an amalgam of the Dalai Lama, Martin Luther King
                and Mother Theresa. Séamus Mallon tells us that we are enjoying
                a period of peace and tranquillity as never existed before, yet
                everyone wakes up each morning to a litany of murderous
                brutality — shooting, maiming and robbery.</p>

                out in £4 million heists that have the approval of the IRA high
                command. I hold no brief for any of those people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us talk about the fundamental principles
                and why these institutions are inherently unstable. They are
                unstable because they are undemocratic. I hear Seamus Mallon
                talk about respecting Sinn Féin’s mandate. Does Mr Mallon
                understand anything about democracy? You cannot participate in
                the democratic process while committed to, and inextricably
                linked with, those wedded to violence of any kind — Orange,
                Green, Loyalist or Republican. That is the fundamental principle
                of democracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin should not be in the Assembly or
                the Executive. They claim to have a mandate, but one thing is
                clear — you cannot have a mandate to do wrong. Hitler had a
                National Socialist Government on the basis of a popular mandate
                — a Government, not just a party. Mr Milosevic, who is now
                lodged in a prison at the Hague for wrongdoing, had a mandate
                from the Serbian people for his actions. Sinn Féin aka IRA
                cannot have a mandate to participate in democracy while they are
                wedded to violence. The party should not be in the Assembly
                because democracy cannot coexist with terror.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is utterly wrong to suggest that they
                should not be here because of the terms of the Belfast
                Agreement. I share, and have always expressed, the view that the
                Belfast Agreement, which was signed up to by the SDLP and the
                Ulster Unionist Party, never contained any sanction imposed on
                Sinn Féin to deliver decommissioning by 22 May 2000. The fudge,
                which was agreed to by all of the so-called democratic parties,
                was that Sinn Féin was there on exactly the same basis as all
                of the other parties. They were committed under the Belfast
                Agreement only to use such influence as they might have to bring
                about decommissioning by that date.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a far bigger, a far stronger, and a
                far more fundamental reason for excluding members of Sinn Féin:
                they are not democrats. They are the frontmen for terrorists,
                and each day that they adhere to their determination not to
                decommission their weapons, they confirm that they are not
                democrats. They emphasise that they are terrorists essentially,
                as do the Loyalist parties that are represented here: they are
                absolutely no different and are equally as murderous and
                detestable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The good democrats here in the form of the
                pro- agreement parties — the posturing whited sepulchres of
                the Alliance Party and the Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition
                — hobnob with them. They work with them. They consider that
                they are the midwives of the agreement. They breastfeed
                terrorism. We must address the real question of democracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have heard many plaudits for Mr Trimble and
                his good relationship with the Deputy First Minister. Everyone
                knows that the relationship has been poisonous for the last two
                years. That is the element of hypocrisy: Mr Ervine provides the
                element of farce.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unless we begin to recognise the basic
                principles of democracy and until Mr Mallon is prepared to do
                what he said in November 1998 and put those terrorists out of
                business, insofar as this is a democratic process, there will be
                no future prospects of any value for the Assembly. Get down to
                basics; be honest; tell the people the truth, and stop
                posturing.</p>

                clarification of the role of the Committee of the Centre, now
                that we do not have a First Minister or a Deputy First Minister
                to monitor. We are due to hold a meeting on Wednesday to arrive
                at our conclusions about the Single Equality Bill. Will it be in
                order to hold that meeting? What is the situation in relation to
                the junior Ministers? Are they carrying out their functions
                without the trappings, or are they now defunct?</p>

                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. That office, and
                its officials, are still in place. It would be wrong for the
                Committee to default on monitoring the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister. I am not aware — and,
                in reading section 19 of the 1998 Act, can see no reason to
                believe — that the junior Ministers cease to hold office in
                these circumstances. There are other circumstances in which the
                junior Ministers cease to hold office, but unless someone can
                point out otherwise, it does not seem to me that they cease to
                hold office in these circumstances. There are still Ministers or
                Members of the Assembly continuing to carry out the functions of
                the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister — not holding
                office, but exercising the functions. It would be remiss of the
                Committee of the Centre, or of the Assembly as a whole, not to
                continue to monitor that and to hold it to account.</p>

                become unparliamentary. When mention is made of groups of

                his attention to the fact that where comments are made which
                have a legal basis in terms of convictions under due process,
                and refer to a number of members of a group of which no

                rule that unparliamentary. It may be that such matters do not
                refer to all the Members of the group — and that may be the
                case for the Member who raises the question, for example — but

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fifth meeting of the North/South
                Ministerial Council for the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights
                sector took place on Friday, 22 June 2001, at the Loughs Agency’s
                headquarters in Prehen. Following nomination by the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister, Mr Sam Foster and I
                represented Northern Ireland. Mr Frank Fahey, Minister for
                Marine and Natural Resources represented the Irish Government.
                The Executive Committee noted the papers for the meeting during
                the week commencing 18 June.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The meeting opened with updates from the
                chairman of the board of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights
                Commission, Mr Peter Savage, and the chief executive of the
                Loughs Agency, Mr Derick Anderson.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The chairman referred to the significant
                contribution that the introduction of the salmon carcass tagging
                scheme is making to curb illegal fishing, particularly in the
                Foyle area. The scheme was introduced on 14 May as a
                conservation and protection measure requiring the tagging and
                recording of all wild salmon and sea trout caught by licensed
                commercial fishermen and anglers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The chief executive elaborated that the
                response from the fishing community to the introduction of the
                scheme has, by and large, been excellent. Additionally, it is
                becoming increasingly obvious that buyers will not accept
                untagged salmon. The chief executive also advised Ministers of
                details in relation to this season’s fish runs, as evidenced
                by data coming from the fish counters at Sion Mills and on the
                River Finn. On the basis of this season’s data to date, stocks
                are looking healthy, and therefore regulations may permit an
                extension of the fishing season by a week.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also heard about coarse and shellfish
                fishing activity. The agency has initiated surveys of the coarse
                fisheries in the Foyle and Carlingford areas, including the
                Newry canal, with a view to their future development as angling
                venues. While the mussel fishery in Foyle continues to develop
                well, and Carlingford had an excellent season, indications
                suggest that limited seed mussels are present in Carlingford,
                and landings are liable to drop over the next two to three
                years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wild oyster landings in the Foyle were
                average last season, and surveys undertaken by the cross-border
                aquaculture initiative team indicate similar landings for the
                forthcoming season though there are concerns about stocks for
                2002. Japanese oyster production in Carlingford is stable at
                about 600 tonnes per annum, though developments on the County
                Down shore should increase this significantly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Work is ongoing to bring forward a marine
                tourism strategy for the areas. While the strategy is not fully
                developed, the agency is working to consolidate angling guides
                for the areas, to develop training courses for hospitality
                providers and to clarify the existing complicated licensing
                system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agency has also resumed enforcement and
                protection duties that had been curtailed during the foot-and-
                mouth disease crisis, and work on pollution detection and
                prevention is ongoing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am satisfied that the Loughs Agency
                continues to deliver on its objectives in a committed and
                enthusiastic manner. It was gratifying to note the enthusiasm
                with which the agency’s good work was received by Minister
                Fahey, who recognised that the agency’s first-class management
                information is worthy of emulation by others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council considered the agency’s
                proposals for targeting social need (TSN) through the provision
                of educational opportunities for schools, the promotion of the
                agency’s interpretive centre, the improvement of angling
                facilities and the development of marine tourism. The Council
                approved the agency’s draft TSN action plan for public
                consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted the agency’s annual
                report for 2000, which will be published in due course. It also
                noted the agency’s proposals to draw up a co-ordinated local
                aquaculture management system (CLAMS) for regulating and
                managing the shell fisheries of the loughs and welcomed the
                agency’s proposal to commission a survey of local views,
                concerns and proposals in that vital area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council approved the agency’s proposals
                for arrangements to consult with fisheries and other interests
                in the areas. These involve setting up an advisory forum and
                focus groups to represent interests such as aquaculture,
                conservation and tourism. Recruitment for membership of these
                groups will be undertaken independently and will start soon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council then considered and approved
                additional expenditure of £81,000 to allow the agency to
                complete work on its new headquarters.</p>

                It is not a straightforward matter and will take some time to
                work through. However, progress is being made. There are unique
                funding arrangements for the commissioners of Irish Lights
                through the general lighthouse fund, and it is necessary to
                ensure proper accountability for that funding.</p>

                comments she made about the Council’s approval of agency
                proposals to have consultative or advisory focus groups. The
                Minister will be aware that there are conflicting interests
                around the shores of Carlingford Lough. On the County Down side
                of the lough, the Carlingford Loughshore Owners’ Association

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the conflict and the
                difficulties that arise. The Loughs Agency has proposed the
                establishment of an advisory forum and focus groups in which
                local fishery interests will be represented. The focus groups
                will be established for specific areas including conservation
                and protection, development of aquaculture, development of
                inland fisheries, development of marine tourism and customer
                service. They will input to the work of the advisory forum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agency has retained consultants to
                recruit members to the forum and the focus groups independently
                so as to ensure that all interests are represented. The aim is
                to have the groups active by the end of the summer.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The statement says that it is becoming
                increasingly obvious that buyers will not accept untagged
                salmon. Can the Minister indicate what evidence there is to
                support that? Can she further confirm that the run of salmon has
                improved, and, if so, by how much? What consultation has taken
                place with fishing organisations to permit an extension of the
                fishing season for one week? Would it be appropriate to extend
                the season by more than one week? Page two of the statement

                ask it, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is about the co-ordinated local
                agricultural management system (CLAMS). Does that include
                Strangford Lough, and if so, what consultation has taken place
                with local fishing organisations and individuals who depend on
                that for their livelihood?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Minister, I will leave it to you to decide
                whether you wish to answer all of those questions.</p>
                <b>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To be honest, I had some difficulty hearing
                all of them. The answer to the last question is no.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards tagged salmon not being saleable,
                I cannot go into detail about that; I have to take the Lough’s
                Agency’s word for it. They informed us at the meeting that the
                information they were gleaning was that only tagged salmon were
                being accepted and that there was difficulty in selling poached
                salmon. So far this season the agency has seized more than 80
                illegal nets, two boats and a number of salmon in the Foyle
                area. Recently, the agency enforcement activities have had to be
                curtailed, as the Member will appreciate, because of the
                foot-and- mouth disease situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agency has recruited 11 temporary staff
                over the summer period to increase its protection effort. The
                salmon carcass tagging scheme will help reduce the level of
                poaching in the Foyle and Carlingford areas. Evidence of a
                decrease in poaching is already being shown. Last year, the
                Loughs Agency seized 126 nets and 222 salmon in the period from
                14 May to 21 June. In the previous year 103 nets and 64 salmon
                were seized during the same period. This indicates the success
                that the Loughs Agency has had in counteracting poaching.</p>

                I welcome the Minister’s statement, and in particular its
                reference to the focus groups and their work. The work of the
                cross-border bodies is important, as it involves people from
                both sides of the border in the future of all-Ireland fishing.
                The Minister mentioned Lough Foyle, Lough Erne and other inland
                fishing areas subject to concern about the relationship between
                stock levels and tourism. Will the remit of these focus groups
                include the ability to deliver future benefit to tourism from
                increased stock levels of salmon? That is a real problem in
                Fermanagh and for other inland lakes.</p>

                the Glenelly, Owenkillew, Strule and Mourne are still closed to
                fishing? If so, when might these rivers open again? I understand
                that they were closed due to the outbreak of foot-and-mouth

                these rivers are still closed. However, these restrictions are
                under review. We have published guidelines explaining to anglers
                that where there is no contact with livestock it is all right to
                resume fishing, and that fishermen should do so in consultation
                with local farmers to reassure themselves.</p>

                Everyone must condemn these attacks. The Minister has already
                referred to my question. What action has been taken by the
                Loughs Agency to counteract poaching activity in its area?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Member’s remarks, and I
                repeat that it is regrettable that people carrying out their
                duties have been attacked. I enquired at the last meeting of the
                Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission (FCILC) whether
                there had been any further attacks and was advised that none
                have occurred in recent times. That is good news.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Poaching activity has decreased in the area
                of the Loughs Agency. I have already given the figures which
                indicate clearly that the salmon carcass tagging scheme is up
                and running and is making the market unprofitable for salmon
                poachers.</p>

                Does the Minister agree that while Japanese oyster production in
                Carlingford Lough is stable, there is a need to improve our
                marketing of that product for export? Will the Minister give the
                House an assurance that the local fishermen who have invested a
                great deal in Carlingford Lough will not be undermined in the
                future negotiations involving the focus groups that she is

                improve the management of the stocks, and marketing the stocks
                will be part of that. The agency is in the business of
                developing the commercial asset of the loughs. I can assure the

                on monitoring rounds, the main theme and purpose of such
                exercises is to adjust the allocation of resources in line with
                a better analysis of the cost pressures. We must ensure that the
                money is adjusted to take account of changes in the delivery of
                public services. The Executive also want to take account of the
                priorities and objectives in the Programme for Government and
                take any new opportunities to promote equality of opportunity.
                We must combine the pragmatic and the strategic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The timetable for monitoring rounds is
                usually such that decisions must be taken and implemented
                quickly. Therefore, the Executive’s practice has been to reach
                decisions through discussions between Ministers, following which
                I will announce the outcome, on behalf of the Executive. The
                Executive are always open to proposals from the Assembly and the
                Committees, and those views can be taken into account in future
                monitoring rounds. However, it has not normally been possible to
                consult Committees directly about the process. Many issues
                require urgent consideration, so that the appropriate
                adjustments can be made to the planning of public services by
                schools, hospitals, Government agencies and grant- aided bodies.
                On this occasion, the Executive have decided to take that
                approach for a substantial proportion of the proposed
                allocations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall announce some decisions on
                reallocations. However, for a variety of reasons, we wish to
                indicate that some of the resources require further
                consideration before the Executive reach a decision. Some
                decisions can be deferred for several weeks and others until the
                autumn. That makes it possible to link this exercise with our
                consideration of the next Budget cycle. It will also present an
                opportunity for the Assembly and the Committees, particularly
                the Committee for Finance and Personnel, to give views on the
                remaining proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must address the question of end-of-year
                carry- over. The Executive have decided that underspend on
                capital expenditure should be carried forward automatically by
                the Department concerned. That reflects the reality that the
                management of capital spending programmes frequently involves
                changes of timing that are outside the control of the spending
                authority concerned, when good management suggests that
                re-phasing or adjustment is the appropriate course of action.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The end-year flexibility arrangements allow
                spending authorities to deal with capital allocations in a more
                flexible and pragmatic way than would be possible if we rigidly
                applied the end-of-year constraint. The Executive support that,
                and end-year flexibility is automatic, subject to careful
                monitoring and assurance that the capital expenditure is in line
                with the proposals in the Programme for Government. The amounts
                involved this year on this heading are £30 million. Those
                resources will be retained by the relevant Departments and
                spending authorities. For technical reasons, the same applies to
                the small amount of underspending on the GP fundholders scheme,
                which is coming to an end.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amount of end-year flexibility available
                for consideration this year amounts to some £52 million. That
                excludes the already mentioned capital carry-over and represents
                1·2% of the departmental allocations. It reflects generally
                prudent estimating by Departments as they manage their spending
                towards the end of each financial year. Parliament and,
                doubtless, this Assembly, place considerable importance on
                ensuring that there is no overspend, which would involve
                expenditure exceeding the amounts authorised under legislation
                and through the Supplementary Estimates. It is therefore
                inevitable that public sector managers ensure that excess votes
                are avoided, with the corollary that there is always some
                underspending at this sort of level. Details are set out in
                table 1 attached to my statement. That £52 million is now
                available for reallocation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some additional resources from the Treasury
                are available and have not yet been allocated. Those comprise
                the £18 million which was added to the Northern Ireland
                departmental expenditure limit in the March Budget and £4·4
                million from the latest round of allocations to the Chancellor’s
                capital modernisation fund. While those resources came from
                particular sources in England, they are available to spend as
                the Executive chooses, and we are not in any way constrained as
                to how we make use of them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this monitoring round, Departments have
                declared savings of £29 million compared to the allocations
                approved in the December Budget. The largest component of that
                is further receipts from house sales, amounting on this occasion
                to £15 million. Those are outside the estimates currently being
                approved through the Budget (No 2) Bill. We have a total of
                £104 million to allocate in this monitoring round.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have frequently drawn attention to the
                constraints that we face in planning our spending. The
                availability of resources through savings of this nature should
                not in any way delude us — or anyone else, for that matter —
                that our spending programmes are not under considerable
                pressure. There are significant demands for spending on services
                which are badly needed and which would be of clear benefit to
                the public. In this monitoring round the bids for additional
                resources which have been lodged exceed the amount available by
                a factor of two. This pales into insignificance compared to the
                position report presented to the Assembly a fortnight ago, which
                showed that the amounts sought by Departments amounted to
                something like 20 times the amount available. That was in a
                context where we, as an Executive, encouraged Departments to be
                judicious in the levels of additional resources they sought for
                next year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the pressure on resources and the wide
                range of aspirations which Executive Ministers and Assembly
                Members have in mind, we need to consider very carefully how
                best to use those resources. The Executive is conscious that
                there are resource pressures, both this year and next. We want
                to shift the emphasis of our financial planning to a better,
                forward-looking basis. There are significant disadvantages in
                making short-term reallocations, triggered by resources becoming
                available as the year progresses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is better to be able to plan resources on
                a longer-term basis and give spending authorities greater
                stability for planning purposes. Plans can change, and we need
                to be ready to respond to fluctuations in cost pressures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One option that we have is to make use of
                some end-year flexibility, not in 2001-02 but in 2002-03. We
                cannot decide this now, as we need to keep an eye on a wide
                range of spending pressures in the current year. However, if it
                is possible, we would like to consider some carry-forward so
                that some of the spending pressures that were identified in the
                position report might be addressed next year. This in turn means
                limiting the extent to which we commit resources this year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of the total of £104 million that we have
                available, the Executive have decided to allocate some £63
                million now. Details of the additional allocations are set out
                in table 2 in my statement. I do not propose to explain in
                detail each item of additional expenditure that we are
                allocating at this time. I will, however, indicate some of the
                more substantial or significant items.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main additional cost to the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development is of course the cost
                associated with foot-and-mouth disease. We are having to fund
                £6·8 million from the departmental expenditure limit for the
                preventative measures and other associated costs. The costs of
                compensation for slaughtered animals, and so on, falls to the
                Treasury through annually managed expenditure and do not
                represent a cost in our spending plans. There are also
                additional costs associated with BSE testing that must be
                addressed urgently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Additional allocations to contribute to
                Belfast’s bid to be the European City of Culture in 2008 have
                been agreed for the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.
                There are also some additional staffing costs required for the
                Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Additional allocations totalling £14 million
                are provided for the Department of Education. That amount
                includes £7·8 million for teachers’ performance pay and £2
                million for work to extend access for the disabled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Additional requirements in my own Department
                amount to £2·4 million. That mainly reflects revised estimates
                of costs for the delivery of services including the cost of
                Government office accommodation and the delivery of some core
                functions. In addition, £0·7 million has been set aside to
                cover additional costs for the Special EU Programmes Body, which
                will need to be put for approval to the North/South Ministerial
                Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new allocations include £6·3 million
                for the Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and
                Employment, or the Department of Employment and Learning as we
                will soon be calling it. This includes an important allocation
                of £3 million for the adaptation of facilities for disabled
                people in both further and higher education, which is vital if
                we are to fulfil our statutory responsibilities to those who
                need access to facilities which at present is difficult or
                impossible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health Service costs are again a major
                feature of this monitoring round. It is proposed to allocate
                £18 million to health services now to address some new cost
                factors including pay settlements at higher levels than expected
                and further transitional costs due to the situation at South
                Tyrone Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will recall that action was taken in
                the last financial year to address the issue of the trust
                deficits. The Department of Finance and Personnel, the Economic
                Policy Unit (EPU) and the Department of Health, Social Services
                and Public Safety also jointly commissioned a report from
                consultants on the background of the trust deficit issue and the
                possible implications for the current and future financial
                years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We recognised that the deficits could be the
                result of a higher activity level in trusts than was provided
                for in the approved budgets, in response to urgent patient
                demand. In that context, action to adjust the trusts’ finances
                might not have been confined to the last financial year. The
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has
                lodged a bid for a further £10 million to address the trusts’
                recovery plans. The Executive have decided to look at this again
                over the next few weeks, in the light of the conclusions of the
                Deloitte &amp; Touche report on the deficit issue, which has
                just been received.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Additional allocations have been made to the
                Department for Regional Development for a number of essential
                and high-priority services. The purposes of these allocations
                include addressing increased costs from the climate change levy
                and oil prices, monitoring cryptosporidium, and dealing with
                costs that affect the water and sewerage service. A total of
                £4·2 million is being provided for the Department for Regional
                Development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A major source of savings for redistribution
                in this monitoring round has been the additional capital
                receipts generated by the Housing Executive due to favourable
                conditions for house sales. That has led to a reduced rental
                income level for the Housing Executive, and we are providing
                £1·5 million pounds to the Department for Social Development
                to make up for that. That and other activities, including
                re-phased provision for welfare reform and modernisation,
                account for the Department for Social Development’s £3·6
                million allocation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are allocating an additional £1·4
                million to the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister. That is to ensure that the Executive’s agenda on
                human rights and equality can be pursued and that appropriate
                provision can be made for the Washington bureau, the Civic Forum
                and the Equality Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are further bids from Departments that
                we need to seriously consider over the coming months. Such is
                the pressure on our spending provision for next year that the
                Executive have decided that it might be necessary to forgo some
                of the bids this year so that additional uncommitted spending
                power can be carried forward into next year. The bids that we
                would defer for further consideration are listed in table 3
                attached to the copies of my statement, which were given to
                Members. In particular, we will want to revisit the position on
                the health trusts when the consultants’ report on the deficit
                issue has been received and considered by the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other significant bids might need to be
                addressed later this month, but many of the bids that are listed
                could still be reconsidered in the next main monitoring round.
                At that point we would need to make a final decision on whether
                to hold some money back from 2001-02 to be deliberately carried
                forward into 2002-03. We will have drawn out the Budget
                proposals for Departments and put them in draft form for the
                Assembly by that stage. The proposals will be based on the level
                of resources that are available for 2002-03. We need to proceed
                on that basis, because at this stage we cannot be sure that it
                will be possible to carry any provision into 2002-03. If it is
                possible, we might be able to adjust the draft Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If it is possible to adjust the draft Budget,
                the Executive will wish to take full account of the views of the
                Assembly Committees and of the outcome of wider consultation.
                The decisions that we need to take on those issues will be
                strongly influenced by what we hear from the Assembly Committees
                during the next few months. I will look, in particular, to the
                Finance and Personnel Committee to advise and assist on these
                difficult and interesting issues.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be helpful to hear views on the
                nature and merit of the deferred bids, which we must return to
                in the autumn, and, in some cases, earlier. It will be
                interesting to hear views on whether we should carry forward any
                spending provision into next year. Members’ reactions to the
                range of issues set out in the position report published last
                month will be highly influential. It is easier to see the
                necessity of addressing some of those bids than to find
                resources available to meet them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are real issues here, which the
                Assembly and the Committees should be in a position to carefully
                consider and influence. The Executive will consider some of
                those issues during July and will need to act clearly and
                directly in the autumn. I am not setting a deadline for comments
                from the Assembly Committees because the timing of the process
                is not ideal from the Members’ perspective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive is bringing this matter to the
                Assembly as early as possible, having dealt with the initial
                round of decisions urgently, in order to make it possible for
                the statement to be made today. We are giving the Assembly
                information on what has been decided and are seeking views and
                input into what has not yet been decided. I look forward to
                hearing the views of Members on these important issues now and
                over the coming months.</p>

                I thank the Minister for his detailed statement. I will touch on
                some issues, as the Committee will have more questions for the
                Minister later today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We note that £104 million has been made
                available to Departments through the Chancellor’s Budget,
                end-of-year flexibility and the savings from Departments. We
                also note that Departments have underspent by almost £30
                million. That is quite a lot of money for reallocation, and it
                raises a number of questions that Committees will want to take
                up in a number of ways.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What areas and circumstances have delivered
                these savings? Are there fundamental flaws in the process that
                need to be addressed? What steps will the Minister of Finance
                and Personnel take to ensure that money has been allocated to
                priority areas?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my constituency people comment that if the
                same amount of money had been put into the South Tyrone hospital
                as had been put into the transitional costs, the hospital might
                still be up and running. If we continue to pay off trust
                deficits, is there a danger that trusts will simply keep
                building up deficits and that we will have no control of the
                management of those trusts? It also raises the issue of the 8%
                rise in rates. In the light of the amount of money that is
                available for reallocation, we must look at the bids that were
                originally made.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Chairperson of the Committee for
                his questions, and I am sure that we will be able to pursue a
                number of them this afternoon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of monitoring rounds is to
                identify resources available. It is good that we can identify
                resources that are available — it would be much more difficult
                if we found that resources were not available. As I spelt out in
                my statement, Departments want to avoid overspending — as a
                result they sometimes overestimate the amount they need. That is
                why we have some resources available at the end of the year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should not look at the moneys that are
                already available this year as some problem for which we pursue
                the Departments that have come forward with those moneys at this
                stage. We should recognise that the process of setting Estimates
                is not as straightforward as we would like it to be. Remember,
                the earlier we set the Estimates cycle in train — particularly
                at the request of this Assembly — the more speculative the
                Estimates are going to be. People will go more for fairly
                &quot;broad brush&quot; Estimates, and subsequently these will
                be subject to more revision and review, which is what we are
                seeing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the South Tyrone Hospital, we
                have taken a decision based on a bid received in this monitoring
                round. Obviously, bids were received in previous monitoring
                rounds, and we are working on the basis of bids received. We
                recognise the significant pressure, and the Executive and I
                recognise the serious difficulties that would result from not
                meeting this bid as it has been put to us by the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety. Regarding possible
                alternatives to this bid, I refer the Member to the Minister and
                the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already said that the Executive will
                be looking at trust deficits again. I note the concern that the
                Chairman has expressed, which is not removed from the concern
                expressed by some Members when last we looked at this issue. I
                would be happy if the Committee for Finance and Personnel, or
                indeed the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety, wanted to address us with its thinking on those issues.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Finance and
                Personnel Committee (Mr Leslie):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his detailed
                statement. A couple of points occur to me. In the bids for
                resources, three different Departments have put in for sums
                amounting to about £2·4 million to pay their fuel bills. I
                presume that this reflects an assumption about oil prices that
                proved optimistic, with oil prices being higher than
                anticipated. Nothing has happened to oil prices, so I further
                presume that they were expected to fall but did not. Can the
                Minister comment on that, and perhaps tell us what oil price was
                used in the Budget? Clearly, this could have an effect for some
                time. I would be interested to know what he thinks the further
                consequences of oil staying at about $29 to the barrel would be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also want to raise a point that comes up
                again and again here. We have another £15 million of receipts
                from house sales. We convert this capital into income —
                putting it into the spending pool. As a consequence, rental
                income to the Housing Executive falls, and we are forced to make
                an allowance of £1·5 million for that, implying a 10% yield on
                those houses. What are we going to do about the housing debt
                that still has to be serviced? Is it prudent for us to continue
                to convert capital into income in this way?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not the first time that we have
                received bids in monitoring rounds to cover difficulties
                regarding oil prices, and it may well not be the last. If any
                Department, or non-departmental public body whose costs
                Departments are reflecting, were making assumptions in relation
                to fuel costs that did not stand up, then obviously we would
                need to look at that. However, people make assumptions on the
                basis of the price indications at the time the Budget is set —
                and that was last autumn.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is part of that issue. The Estimates will
                not be perfect because not everything stands still. Not
                everything remains equal, and the earlier we make the Estimates
                cycle, as the Assembly wants us to do, the more variance there
                may be when it comes to out-turns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards house sales, the right to buy
                exists. It was a particular problem in the past when the Housing
                Executive, as well as handing over the money from sales, had to
                withstand the loss of rental income. It is not unreasonable to
                make good that loss, and that point has been emphasised by many
                Members in the House, including some in the Member’s own
                party.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to try to reinvest in capital where
                we can do so. I have indicated that we need to look at the
                question that the Member has raised to see what is the best way
                of managing a facility that may lend itself to a better and more
                sensible approach.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement,
                particularly the allocation made for the childcare subsidy for
                lone parents under New Deal. Can the Minister confirm that the
                allocation will further encourage single parents to enter the
                labour market and avail of economic opportunities arising, and
                that this is further evidence of our commitment to exclude no
                one from the benefits as we build a society based on equality,
                fairness and opportunity?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am happy to confirm that this is what the
                Executive are trying to do in meeting this particular bid. It
                should provide the Department with the necessary financial
                resources to meet claims for childcare subsidies during 2001.
                The Department for Social Development will be responsible for
                meeting those claims in the future. However, as regards our
                commitment to social inclusion, targeting social need and to
                making the most of New Deal with respect to our particular
                regional needs and opportunities, the Executive’s decision to
                meet that bid is a useful example of the value of devolution.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement and the
                facts and figures that he has given. The Minister posed several
                questions about carrying forward money. First, I would like him
                to consider the idea of being able to carry money forward, or
                give a guarantee that a project entered into can be sustained
                over a period of time. I am thinking of the Hayes Report, which
                recommends a hospital for the south-west of the Province. When
                it eventually arrives in Omagh, we are thinking in terms of £60
                million. That money needs to be spread over time in order to
                purchase the land, the infrastructure and the bricks and mortar.
                However, the final and largest gulp of money is for the
                technology that will go into the building. How would that be
                seen in regard to financial and resource funding?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, another concern to every councillor
                in the west of the Province is the £15 million raised from
                house sales, which most of us agree should go back into housing
                provision to provide a modern stock of housing in the public
                sector at all times. Perhaps there is a budgeting arrangement
                whereby money is returned to the Exchequer. However, there
                should be some reward so that we can maintain a good level of
                public sector housing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, I noticed from the forecast figures
                that the Department for Regional Development is asking for £15
                million to deal with the backlog of roads projects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Four years ago, one council alone had a
                backlog of £32 million. If we add that to the other one in west
                Tyrone, that is a backlog of £64 million. That does not deal
                with road safety or necessary modern structural improvements.

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first question was not particularly
                concerned with in-year monitoring. It would not be appropriate
                for me to answer, in the context of monitoring round decisions,
                questions about outcomes that might emerge from the Hayes
                Report, decisions that might or might not be made and how those
                decisions would be brought forward in relation to a possible new
                hospital in the south-west. I do not think that the questions I
                have raised about carrying forward some money that has fallen to
                us this year into next year to assist with the pressures in the
                position report are a relevant premise for the question that the
                Member asked.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to house sales, the Member seems
                to suggest that whatever income comes in from house sales should
                all automatically go into the housing budget. All Departments
                and agencies are asked to bring forward budgets for the incoming
                financial year and to make their plans accordingly. The Budget
                that we set includes assumptions about income from house sales,
                just as it includes assumptions about rental income. If the
                money available from house sales increases significantly, then
                rather than automatically falling to the Housing Executive, it
                is right that it should fall to the block as a whole for us to
                decide its best use. Where income falls — as rental income
                falls because of house sales — the question can arise again,
                in relation to the block, as to whether we make good that fall
                in income. To suggest that added revenue should lie where it
                falls is unfair to those programmes that cannot generate
                revenue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is significant that the Member went on to
                talk about the £15 million bid for roads. It is an unusual
                coincidence that the extra revenue from house sales, which the
                Member is saying should automatically go to the Housing
                Executive and not be taken to the centre, is equal to the figure
                requested by the Department for Regional Development for roads.
                We would not have money available for other Departments to bid
                on if we chose the course that the Member recommended in the
                earlier part of his question.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister on his approach,
                especially as it creates an opportunity for the Assembly and its
                Committees, particularly the Finance and Personnel Committee, to
                have an input into the decision-making process for the remaining
                resources in October. Can the Minister confirm that this is a
                further step in the process of opening up the budgetary process,
                something that would have been unheard of in the days of direct
                rule?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a reflection of the more open, and, I
                hope, more informed, approach that we have taken to financial
                planning considerations than would have been possible under
                direct rule. I recognise that the amount of money that we are
                talking about holding over for consideration in the autumn as to
                whether to allocate it this year or next is not huge compared to
                the overall Budget. Given that we will have little room to
                manoeuvre next year, as reflected in the position report, it is
                right to try to let the Assembly have a bit more of a hard
                shoulder to drive on than we would otherwise have. There are
                very challenging questions in the position report for the
                Executive and departmental Committees, but if we have some more
                scope in financial terms, it will give the Committees more scope
                for consideration and influence.</p>

                increase in the community care budget now? We are faced with
                deficits in all the trust areas. Only recently, as the Minister
                is aware, we debated the underfunding in the Down Lisburn Trust.
                We know about the deficits. Rather than wait for a Deloitte
                Touche report, we should spend money to remove those deficits
                now, so that we can start afresh in the next financial year.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Close for his unusual welcome for
                my statement. I hope that his sense that our presentation is
                improving will be borne out by future developments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member spoke about the amount of money
                that was left over from last year. I agree that we should be a
                caring Administration. However, we must also be a careful
                Administration. That means that we must ensure that we spend
                money wisely. If money does not need to be spent in the way that
                we had expected, it can be put to other uses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today, we are announcing the allocation of
                over £63&nbsp;million, including £18&nbsp;million to the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, as well
                as funding for other key services. There are outstanding bids
                for other services, including further services in the Department
                of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. We must address
                the issue of the trust recovery plans, but I remind the Member
                that we allocated money in a monitoring round in the last
                financial year to make good the problem of trust deficits.
                Indeed, the Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and
                Personnel conveyed some concerns that that might become too much
                of a habit. An additional bid has now been received for trust
                recovery plans, and those plans are based on the avoidance of
                future deficits. We will take action in that area, and views of
                the kind that the Member has expressed can be channelled through
                the Committee for Finance and Personnel when it considers that
                question.</p>

                figure of £2·8&nbsp;million has been set aside for that. How
                much money did the Department ask for? Did it ask for extra
                money to deal with waiting lists, for which £2&nbsp;million has

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon is asking questions relating to
                table 3. Table 3 does not list the bids that are being met.
                Those are not the allocations that are being announced today.
                Table 2 gives the allocations that are being announced today as
                part of the £63 million. I have said that there are other bids
                that are not being met and that they will be deferred for wider
                consideration in the autumn, or in some cases, such as for the
                trust deficits and some other issues, later this month.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amount that the Department bid for with
                regard to waiting lists and specialist drugs is exactly the
                figure that the Member read out. Those are the bids.</p>

                resources that have flowed from it. Does he agree that the
                process of resource allocation in this devolved Administration
                should follow our needs and not just automatically follow on
                from what happens in Britain, thereby demonstrating the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that we should make our own decisions
                according to our own needs. We want to make many of the changes
                and take many of the positive steps that are taking place across
                the water, but we have to recognise the needs of our own
                particular services. In some cases, particular costs and
                pressures arise, not just because of our demographic make-up,
                but also because we have economy of scale issues and a different
                administrative structure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should also remember that taking decisions
                according to our own needs is not just a matter of saying that
                we are jealous of our own discretion. It also means that we have
                to be hard-headed about the choices that we make for ourselves.</p>

                Public Safety to meet the requirements of the elderly, many of
                whom feel neglected, with no money in community services, is

                detail the bids that we have received. In a monitoring round,
                the Department of Finance and Personnel, working with the
                Economic Policy Unit, can only deal with the bids that it
                receives. The same applies to the Executive. We have taken
                decisions on that basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise that there are services in all

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for that response. The
                Bill has been published since I tabled the question. However, is
                the Minister aware of a recent Alliance Party policy document
                which talked about the need to protect the interests of small
                and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) within the concept of the
                new Invest Northern Ireland (INI) single agency? If the Minister
                did not see the Alliance Party policy document he may have seen
                a very similar one from the SDLP.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister have any information on how
                the interests of those existing small businesses — which
                perhaps have the potential for the greatest growth over the
                coming years — will be covered in an agency which might
                otherwise be dominated by the needs of inward investors?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure the Member that any agency in
                Northern Ireland that ignores SMEs would be better not in
                existence. Ours is a small company economy. Small companies
                employ the vast majority of people who work here; that is where
                the growth has occurred. However, that is not a Northern Ireland
                factor. The number of people who work for the Fortune 500
                companies in the United States has not increased in the past 10
                years; the growth has been in the small business sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure the Member that I know that great
                minds think alike. I am also conscious, if INI is to succeed,
                that it will have targets to achieve in its corporate and
                operating plans. The emphasis will be on increasing the birth
                rate of small businesses, where Northern Ireland has a lower
                start-up rate — but a higher survival rate — than elsewhere
                in the United Kingdom. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment wants to marry those two factors to increase the
                number of start-ups.</p>

                that bundles the existing agencies into a lethargic, heavyweight
                bundle? Will any fresh faces or new ideas in marketing be
                brought in from the private sector? Will the excellent work of
                the Industrial Research and Technology Unit (IRTU) be
                safeguarded and possibly expanded? I see that as vital to any
                future industrial expansion.</p>

                this issue. I know how passionately he feels about the need to
                ensure that innovation is at the heart of what the agency does.
                I assure Dr McDonnell that this is not intended to be a Lego set
                in which agencies are simply bolted together and called a new
                agency; that is not the case. The aspects of policy for which
                IRTU is responsible will be at the core and will be, as we said
                in our statement, the golden thread that will run through the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the agency being
                marketing-led, there must be people involved who have a
                marketing capability. The Department hopes to advertise for the
                appointment of a chief executive designate shortly, and I have
                given the consultants my views on that matter. It is hoped that
                those views will be reflected in the draft, because it is
                essential that we have people who understand what a customer is.

                comprehensive programme that is working its way through the
                system. Well over half of the money has been spent. It has been
                spent in different markets: the European market; the North
                American market; and the domestic market — across the board.
                It has also been spent sectorally — to deal with the point the
                Member makes — because different sectors require different
                promotion. I assure the Member that that is happening.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we reach the stage where the money has

                programmes will be rolling out into the autumn — we will
                evaluate what we have received for that money and the impact
                that it is making, or has made, on the market.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome, in part, the Minister’s answers
                to the question. Is he confident that sufficient funding has
                been set aside for consequential support, given that some
                businesses and tourist providers were seriously affected?
                Perhaps he is aware that the takings of some businesses, hotels
                and guest houses were down by 70%; others were down by 100%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister satisfied that he has enough
                money? Will he put his shoulder to the wheel with his Colleague,
                the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, in her
                request to get consequential payments to help these people make
                up the loss?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am acutely aware of the point that the
                Member makes, though we must not confuse two different issues.
                We have a fund of £1 million that was put in place as a
                recovery measure for the industry; there is then the scheme for
                compensation to businesses, which does not come out of that
                fund. That is a separately funded project.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The full extent of how much the scheme for
                compensation to businesses will cost is not yet clear to the
                Executive. Claims have been received — we have now passed the
                point by which people had to register, which was 20 June — and
                we are not able to assess the full extent yet. No one is going
                to suggest that three months worth of rates is going to
                compensate someone who has suffered a drop of 70% in their
                business. My Colleague, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development, is looking at some cases, such as those of the
                marts that were forced to close by her Department. That is an
                issue that we will be dealing with separately.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On consequential resources, as a proportion
                of our spending and as a proportion of our population, we have
                allocated more resources to this issue than has anyone else in
                these islands. My Colleague, the Minister of Finance and
                Personnel, is chasing after consequential resources that we hope
                to get from the Treasury in respect of some of our spending on
                this matter. Even allowing for that, we are spending at least
                three times more than the consequential that we would receive as
                a share of national resources.</p>

                outbreak, how successful has the campaign been to attract

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is one of the key, sad aspects of the
                situation. The image of the outbreak that was portrayed by CNN
                featured the Prime Minister in a protective suit. Prospective
                visitors were asking if these suits were provided free at
                airports, and they feared that if they came here their hands and
                feet would fall off. They were asking whether there would be any
                food to eat. My Colleague in the Republic, James McDaid,
                received exactly the same bizarre enquiries, unbelievable as
                they might be. There is a huge misunderstanding of the
                situation, but the information is beginning to get through.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sadly, the disease was also confused with BSE,
                which is a much more deep-seated problem. There is a downturn in
                the figures relating to US tourists for both jurisdictions of
                this island and throughout the United Kingdom. Bookings for
                holidays in July and August were being made around the time of
                the outbreak, and therefore potential visitors were put off.
                Some operators which had booked seats on aircraft had to cancel
                for financial reasons. It is too early to tell what the loss
                will be. We will have suffered a downturn, but industry
                representatives advise me that there is evidence of recovery.</p>

                the gas and electricity regulator to the Enterprise, Trade and

                me that my Department wants to see the extension of the gas
                supply through as much of Northern Ireland as possible. He will
                also be aware that a huge amount of effort, in the Department
                and elsewhere, is going into achieving that. I am in regular
                contact with Mrs O’Rourke, the Republic’s Minister for
                Public Enterprise. The Executive have discussed the issue in the
                past couple of weeks, and my Department, the Department of
                Finance and Personnel and the Economic Policy Unit have formed a
                negotiating team. During the summer months, we will refine the
                final proposals, which we hope to sign off in the autumn.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are huge issues, not all of which are
                within our control. As Members know, our objective is to get a
                south/north pipeline and a north-west pipeline, so that as much
                of Northern Ireland as possible can have access to natural gas.
                However, we are in the hands of the companies which would carry
                that out. We have an application from the Electricity Supply
                Board of Ireland (ESBI) to build a power station at Coolkeeragh.
                That application is dependent on there being a supply of gas in
                place by a certain date.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the wider issue of joining up
                the networks to create an all-island gas market. That, in turn,
                is related to our links with the UK and European gas markets.
                That is our objective, and I have set it out on many occasions.
                We are pursuing it as vigorously as we can. The Executive and
                the Department of Finance and Personnel are involved. I hope
                that we will be in a position to report significant progress by

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The answer to the detailed question is that
                the Department has not been in any negotiations. I am aware,
                however, that the Corrib field on the west coast of Ireland,
                which the Member referred to, looks likely to produce
                significant resources of natural gas. That will be available to
                the grid by 2003-04. The Department has not yet seen the
                proposals for any particular route that will have an impact on
                Northern Ireland. There is clearly a demand for gas in County
                Donegal, which could be facilitated by the Department’s own
                north-west proposals. However, the ultimate objective is to have
                a totally integrated system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be misleading of me to say to the

                Members of &quot;Team West Tyrone&quot; regularly draw the House’s
                attention to their active promotion of their area. However, we
                must remember the limitations. The pipeline will not go
                everywhere — we must face up to that reality. Our objective is
                to ensure that the pipeline goes to as many places as possible,
                but there is a commercial limitation to what is available.</p>

                control the finances. The progress towards south Down is
                welcome. However, is the Minister pressing the case for other
                areas on the basis of economic equality of opportunity so that
                the gas pipeline is extended to places such as Fermanagh and

                holder, and it may wish to start further exploration in County
                Fermanagh. New technology has provided a better opportunity for
                the extraction of gas in the particular geological conditions in
                that county. Also, the price of gas has risen substantially
                since the original licence was granted some years ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am hopeful that there may be some activity
                in that area, although it is not necessarily linked to the sort
                of project that the Member prefers. However, I suspect that
                people in Fermanagh will not particularly worry about which pipe
                the gas comes out of, if it comes at all. At the moment I am not
                aware of any proposal to bring a pipe up from Corrib through the
                western corridor. That is something that the Irish Government
                will have to address. If we can play any role in that, we will
                be more than happy to do so.</p>

                problems. I am fully aware that the Minister of Education is
                involved with the issue at school level, and both Departments
                are in regular consultation on this matter. Through the

                under a general framework covering Great Britain as well as
                Northern Ireland, with some variations in each Administration.
                In Northern Ireland one of the main differences is that account
                holders taking computer courses are entitled to a discount of
                80% — up to a maximum of £400 — as a special introductory
                offer. The maximum payment in Great Britain is £200.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the unexpectedly rapid uptake of
                accounts, and that in practice the average payment has been just
                over £200, I am now satisfied that the higher rate is no longer
                needed to stimulate usage of individual learning accounts here.
                Therefore, from 1 August the maximum incentive will be available
                at the British level. Any account holder who has booked a
                qualifying course before that date will continue to be entitled
                to the higher incentive.</p>

                disappointing uptake by the unemployed — only about 1·8%.
                Should the higher incentive stay in place to address skills
                upgrading among the unemployed to encourage them to open

                individual learning account is being drawn down. Individual
                learning accounts are not designed primarily for the unemployed
                — New Deal and other programmes are more suitable for their
                needs. The main targets are those who have been reluctant to
                engage in adult learning, particularly those in low-skilled or
                part-time jobs who wish to enhance their skills and prospects. I
                hope, however, that those leaving New Deal and other programmes

                part-time can gain valuable work experience in addition to the
                financial benefits, which are probably the primary objective.
                Those working long hours may have difficulty, however, in
                keeping up with their academic commitments. We have had evidence
                from recent research regarding the impact of part-time work on
                those in their later school years — at sixth-form level —
                but we do not have the same amount of detail on the impact at
                university level in Northern Ireland. In general, it is a matter
                for students to balance the different aspects of their lives
                and, in particular, to maintain a focus on their studies rather
                than allowing part-time work to distract them from the prime
                purpose of being a student.</p>

                specify the improvements that might be necessary for better
                health and safety conditions. The Housing Executive has set
                specific standards that must be achieved. Those deal with issues
                such as facilities for the storage, preparation and cooking of
                food, the number of suitably located water closets, the
                provision of an adequate number of suitably located fixed baths
                or showers and wash basins, an adequate means of escape from
                fire and other fire precautions. I am satisfied that these

                This will involve a registration scheme, and only those
                properties which meet an acceptable standard will be permitted
                to register. This will further enhance the Housing Executive’s
                powers to ensure that houses in multiple occupation meet the
                necessary standards. If Mrs Nelis, or any other Member, knows of
                a particular house that concerns them, I want to hear about it.

                reply. I am sure that he will agree with me that many towns and
                villages lack the vitality and social infrastructure that would
                enable them to develop economically and socially, particularly
                for the next generation. In view of the support plans and
                strategy that he has referred to, would he not think it
                advisable to undertake an audit of these deficiencies on a
                district- by-district basis, so that the strategy, planning and
                finance could be better geared to those in greatest need, and
                who, indeed, identified the need in the first place?</p>

                will be a targeting of needs in relation to neighbourhood
                renewal. My Department will carry out a widespread consultation.
                The decision on the allocation of scarce resources will be
                largely determined by information such as the impending
                publication of the Noble indices that update and refine the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted to have this opportunity to
                report progress on the formulation of the regional development
                strategy (RDS). I thank the 10 Statutory Committees for their
                valuable contributions. I have sought to reflect their views, as
                far as possible, in the latest text of the strategy that I have
                made available to Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before I detail some of the key themes in the
                strategy, it would be worthwhile by way of background to set out
                briefly the approach that has been taken. Essentially the
                strategy has been prepared with a commitment to achieving a
                strong, spatially balanced economy; a healthy environment; and
                an inclusive society that tackles inequalities across the
                socio-economic spectrum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The promotion of sustainable development is a
                key theme running through the document. However, sustainability
                is much more than a commitment to putting the environment at the
                heart of policies. It is also much more than achieving an
                optimal approach to sustaining physical development that makes
                use of our existing infrastructure. Hand in hand with that must
                go a commitment to sustaining communities. That is why social
                and economic cohesion is at the heart of the strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Long-term planning is a complex process.
                Reaching agreement on the shape and content of the strategy has
                taken time — some people would say an inordinate length of
                time. I would argue that it is better for that unprecedented
                consultation to have taken place. That investment has helped set
                the right long-term directions for the future development of
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the course of the consultation exercise,
                meetings were held with all district councils; workshops were
                held with approximately 100 groups; and a university- led
                community consortium held conferences involving 400 community
                groups. Separate conferences and seminars were held on themes
                relating to the economy, rural issues and youth. Many meetings
                were held with individual Departments, agencies and a wide
                variety of groups as well as individuals. The team was also
                advised by a panel of international experts.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft strategy came under the scrutiny of
                public examination — the first of this type to be held in
                Northern Ireland. That provided a further opportunity to help
                build consensus on the way forward for the future development of
                Northern Ireland. The public examination and the assistance of
                the independent panel enabled the regional strategic framework
                to be improved and strengthened in the best interests of future
                development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft strategy was also considered in
                great detail by the Committee for Regional Development and the
                other Statutory Committees. Once again, I thank the members of
                those Committees for the way in which they went about their task
                and for the valuable and helpful contributions that they made to
                help me finalise the document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this stage it is normal practice for the
                Chairperson of the relevant Committee to lead off. However, the
                Chairperson of the Committee for Regional Development, Alban
                Maginness, is absent today due to the death of his mother. I
                tender my consolation and condolences to Mr Maginness, and I am
                sure all Members join with me in that regard.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy is firmly based on the principle
                of securing balanced regional development to assist all
                communities to realise their potential. The consultation has
                been inclusive and participative. Today represents a key stage
                in that process in allowing the House to offer its views on the
                formulation of the strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy provides the spatial context for
                strengthening the competitiveness of the regional economy,
                tackling social and economic disadvantage and protecting and
                enhancing Northern Ireland’s physical, natural and man-made
                assets. It provides a context for housing, transport, air and
                water quality, energy and waste strategies. It will provide for
                an optimal framework for infrastructure providers in the public
                and private sectors. It also provides the important context
                against which development plans will be produced and against
                which public and private investment decisions relating to land
                use will be made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will highlight some of the key themes of
                the strategy and comment on my responses to areas of particular
                concern to Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An issue that has exercised almost every
                Member is the need to set a challenging target for the
                development of housing in urban areas; in short, a target for
                brownfield development. There is a strong consensus that the
                Department for Regional Development should be more ambitious
                than the public examination suggested when it endorsed the
                principle of a drive for more brownfield housing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened carefully to the concerns
                expressed by Members. The way forward outlined in the strategy
                responds in a positive, balanced and practical way to those
                concerns. We should seek to double the recent levels of
                development in urban areas between now and 2010. The level of
                housing development in urban areas over the past 10 years has
                been around 25% to 30%. The strategy signals that that level is
                inconsistent with the policy objectives that we set ourselves;
                we should aim to double that over the next 10 years. That will
                set an ambitious regional target of 60% up to the first review
                in 2010 without the risk of town cramming.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This target will be subject to monitoring,
                evaluation, and a five-year review in the light of the latest
                housing data. Ultimately the figures that will be achieved for
                individual settlements will be determined by urban capacity
                studies that will take place through the development plan
                process. This approach will be copper- fastened by the
                sequential approach in the development plan process. The search
                sequence will focus firstly on the reuse of previously developed
                land and buildings and consideration of undeveloped land within
                the existing urban area before consideration outside the urban
                footprint. This is the strongest policy mechanism for preventing
                the previous trend toward greenfield development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The test means that, in selecting sites to
                meet an established housing need, the brownfield sites will be
                allocated before the greenfield sites are considered. I hope
                that the House will agree that this is a clear signal that we
                are serious about this issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now wish to turn to two other issues on the
                theme of housing; overzoning and affordable housing. Both issues
                were raised by a number of Committees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened carefully to both sides of the
                argument about overzoning. I have come down in favour of a
                modest allowance for overzoning, but this will be the exception
                rather than the rule. Therefore, I propose to make provision in
                the strategy for a limited level of overzoning up to a maximum
                of 10% as a contingency in those situations where a potential
                land difficulty is likely to arise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stress that the preferred approach is to
                identify possible constraints in advance and proceed on
                alternative lands without overzoning. I believe that this
                approach is broadly consistent with the line taken by the public
                examination and sensibly avoids the risk of unnecessary
                litigation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I turn now to affordable housing. I want to
                refer to this issue as it was highlighted by the Committee for
                Social Development. I have made it clear in the strategy that
                there is a commitment to make provision for affordable housing
                particularly, but not exclusively, for first-time buyers and
                those on lower incomes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy encourages the development of
                balanced local communities. It is crucial that we ensure that
                new housing developments help secure a better social mix by
                maintaining a balanced planning linkage where needed between
                market and social housing. The creation of large areas of
                housing of similar characteristics will not be acceptable.
                Therefore, the strategy will promote social housing targeted to
                meet identified needs and require an appropriate provision in
                larger developments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the time remaining I wish to address four
                other areas in the strategy. I want to say a few words about the
                legal context of the regional development strategy. Under
                current law the Department of the Environment and the Department
                for Social Development are required to ensure that any area plan
                or development scheme is consistent with the strategy when it is
                formulated. Concerns have been raised that &quot;consistent
                with&quot; might introduce an unnecessary and undesirable
                inflexibility into the planning system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following receipt of an opinion from senior
                legal counsel, I have decided to promote amending legislation
                that would substitute a requirement that development plans and
                schemes must be in general conformity with the regional
                development strategy. I am satisfied that the proposed
                amendment, which I intend to sponsor in the next sitting,
                preserves the authority of the regional development strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to turn to rural matters. The strategy
                is as much about rural areas as it is about urban areas. Rural
                communities must have the opportunity to realise their full
                potential, to develop in their own right, and to contribute more
                broadly to a prosperous Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy signals the importance of the
                work on the regional transportation strategy. The strategy’s
                vision is to have a modern, sustainable, safe transportation
                system which benefits society, the economy and the environment,
                and which actively contributes to social inclusion and everyone’s
                quality of life. The regional transportation strategy will be a
                daughter document to the regional development strategy, serving
                to implement a key strand of the strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the chapter on implementation I have tried
                to avoid being overly prescriptive or setting up new structural
                or legal arrangements that would cut across other departmental
                responsibilities. My approach is founded on four key principles.
                First, Departments must work together if the strategy is to be
                delivered coherently. Secondly, it will not be delivered without
                the buy-in of local key stakeholders, by which I mean district
                councils and the new emerging local strategic partnership
                arrangements. Thirdly, I recognise that the Government alone
                will not deliver this strategy; there is a major role for the
                private sector in our future development. Fourthly, our
                approach, by necessity, has to be sufficiently flexible to adapt
                and respond to change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The underpinning principle of the strategy is
                that it must be seen to relate to people’s needs, now and in
                the future. Every part of the country, urban and rural, must be
                able to relate to the strategy. I believe that the strategy does
                precisely that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I express my gratitude to the team of
                officials that prepared the strategy. The team leader was
                deservedly awarded the CBE for his tremendous service to
                planning. That award reflects the high esteem in which he is
                held.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that Members agree that significant
                progress has been made towards the formulation of the regional
                development strategy. I welcome this opportunity to appraise
                Members of the stage reached and to seek assurance from the
                Assembly that the strategy is soundly based and provides the
                basis for its formulation.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                Regional Development (Mr McFarland):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, the Chairperson of the
                Regional Development Committee is unable to be here because of a
                family bereavement. I tender both my sympathy and that of the
                Committee to him at this time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before responding to some of the issues
                addressed by the Minister, I extend my thanks and the thanks of
                the Committee to the Minister and his officials. In particular I
                would like to add to the Minister’s comments and extend my
                thanks to departmental officials for the manner in which they
                have so ably taken forward this major project. They have made
                themselves available to the Committee on numerous occasions,
                sometimes at very short notice. They have responded positively
                to the views and comments of all the Committees, and this is
                clearly reflected in the latest draft of the strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Regional Development is to
                be commended for the unprecedented level of consultation that
                took place. The support of a panel of international experts, the
                public examination and the appointment of an independent panel
                has ensured a rigorous examination that has taken into account a
                wide spectrum of views, right across Northern Ireland. The
                extent of the consultation process reflects the importance of
                the regional development strategy to Northern Ireland. I hope
                that this extensive consultation process, which has taken
                account of many different interests, will help to ensure that
                the strategy is successfully implemented.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document produced by the Department sets
                out the proposed strategy for the future development of Northern
                Ireland to 2025. The proposals aim to provide and sustain a high
                quality of life for all citizens in the twenty-first century.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As stated in the Programme for Government,
                this will be the framework for tackling the deficiencies of our
                infrastructure and for helping the overall development of our
                society.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It cannot be overstressed that the framework
                is not simply for the Department for Regional Development but
                for all Departments, as it will impact on a wide range of areas,
                such as environment, housing, rural development, tourism,
                business and employment opportunities. It is a framework that
                must overarch the work of all Departments. This strategy
                represents a golden opportunity to create a vibrant and cohesive
                society with a strong local economy, supported by excellent
                public services throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Minister rightly points out, a key
                concern of many of the Committees was the issue of the
                development of housing in existing urban areas known as
                brownfield sites. My Committee and others were greatly concerned
                that there was no clear target for brownfield development.
                Discussions on this topic went on until the eleventh hour. I met
                with the Minister and officials on 25 June, and officials
                attended the Committee meeting last Wednesday to discuss the
                matter further.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee members pushed the Department
                very hard on this issue. It is vital to send a clear message to
                developers and to make the rules clear to planners, that
                brownfield options must be explored and exhausted before
                consideration is given to building on greenfield sites. In
                Belfast this means utilising brownfield sites and then,
                according to the strategy, developing out through the Lagan
                valley and the M2/Glengormley corridor. This is crucial to
                ensure that our cities and towns are regenerated and made much
                more attractive. The regional development strategy sets the
                rules for future planning, and it must be right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to the Minister and his
                officials for the efforts that they have made, within tight
                deadlines, to revise the text of the document on the issue of
                brownfield sites. A target of 60% is now specified. That will be
                revisited in light of the urban capacity studies being carried
                out by the Department of the Environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge developers and planners to abide by
                the rules laid down in the document. Future local area plans
                will be based on this document. I also strongly urge my
                Colleague, the Minister of the Environment, to quickly process
                the urban capacity studies which will provide a database of all
                brownfield sites.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that the Planning Division will take
                account of all brownfield sites, regardless of size, so that an
                accurate figure is reached. It is to be hoped that this will
                lead to figures in excess of 60% being achieved for urban
                development to accommodate the 160,000 new dwellings required
                over the next 15 years. I caution against limiting the scope of
                the database. I understand that there are some proposals to
                include only those sites with more than a 10-house capacity.
                This will suit the larger developer, because he will sooner get
                out onto the greenfield sites. The parameters of the database
                must be brought down, or it will not identify all sites
                available for brownfield development, particularly in the large
                cities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to touch upon the issue of
                overzoning. This was another area that exercised the Regional
                Development Committee. In the past, developers have been allowed
                to overzone a housing development by as much as 25% in some
                cases. The Committee was concerned that developers were treating
                overzoning as a standard planning practice. The major
                consequence of this practice has been sizeable encroachments
                onto the green belt. It was also noted that in England there was
                no allowance for overzoning. Following discussions with the
                Minister and his officials, the ability of developers to
                overzone has been greatly reduced. Although the Minister has
                limited overzoning to a maximum level of 10%, I am reassured
                that he regards this as the exception, rather than the rule. In
                the light of this, however, I ask the Minister to liase with his
                ministerial Colleague, Mr Foster, to ensure that stringent rules
                are put in place to assess developers’ requests for overzoning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister also referred to the need to
                provide affordable housing for first-time buyers and those on
                low incomes. This is to be welcomed. There has been a growing
                trend among developers to target the more affluent areas, as a
                means of maximising returns. We need to be conscious of
                developing a cohesive and inclusive society. This can be partly
                addressed by seeking to provide those at the lower end of the
                social scale with affordable and accessible housing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that the Minister acknowledged
                that a balance must be struck between rural and urban
                development. Indeed, the regional development strategy will
                undoubtedly play a critical role in rural development.
                Provincial towns and their rural hinterland are heavily
                dependent on good physical infrastructure and an efficient and
                effective public transport system in order to support local
                commerce and allow businesses to remain competitive and continue
                to grow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members felt that too strong an emphasis
                was placed on the Belfast metropolitan area, and references to
                other areas were simply a bolt-on to the plans for the Greater
                Belfast area. The Committee for Regional Development was of the
                view that the strategy must provide opportunities for all parts
                of our community and that there must be balanced development
                across all of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to report to the Assembly that
                the Department responded positively to the Committees’
                comments and subsequently made amendments to the document,
                including significant improvements to the section on Londonderry
                as the regional city for the north-west. There was also a
                notably stronger emphasis on developing the major provincial
                towns as main hubs, providing key public services and employment
                opportunities for both townspeople and the rural communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I caution, however, that the success of rural
                development, as with all other areas of the strategy, is
                dependent on how the strategy is implemented. That was a major
                concern for the Committee. There is little point in developing a
                plan if it cannot be successfully implemented. Other Departments
                must be fully committed to the strategy and play their role in
                its implementation. To this end, the Committee recommended that
                ministerial weight should be given to those tasked with
                implementation. I am pleased to note that an interdepartmental
                group, to be chaired by the Minister for Regional Development,
                will be set up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note the Minister’s intention to bring
                forward amending legislation, whereby development plans and
                schemes must be in general conformity with the regional
                development strategy, and his reassurance that that amendment
                will not dilute the authority of the regional development
                strategy. Given that all Departments, particularly the
                Department of the Environment, must fully embrace the regional
                development strategy, I seek assurance from the Minister that
                that will be carefully monitored and areas of non-compliance
                speedily addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a general plea, I urge the Minister and
                the Department to implement the strategy promptly, and for all
                other Departments, district councils and all others involved to
                fully and honestly play their roles in its implementation. I
                also urge the Department to press on with development and
                implementation of the regional transportation strategy, which
                will complement the regional development strategy and, indeed,
                is vital to it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must all look very critically at how the
                necessary funding for the regional development strategy is to be
                found. The Committee for Regional Development has examined the
                position report issued by the Executive Committee and will write
                to the Committee for Finance and Personnel on implications. It
                is clear that alternative means of funding must be found to
                ensure that the improvements to our roads and water
                infrastructure, and the transport system, can go ahead. The
                Committee for Regional Development will be carefully monitoring
                and examining progress on that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I thank all Committees that provided
                constructive comments on the draft regional strategy. On behalf
                of the Chairperson, I want to pay particular tribute to the
                members of the Committee for Regional Development who have
                painstakingly examined and studied the various drafts of the
                regional development strategies. They have made very useful and
                constructive comments and suggestions to guide and advise the
                Department so that we now have a strategy that provides a vital
                framework for the planned future development of our country over
                the next 25 years and beyond. I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to debate the
                Department for Regional Development’s draft regional
                development strategy and commend the Minister for bringing
                forward the motion. The devising of a regional development
                strategy has been a complex process and will be of fundamental
                importance in addressing the needs of Northern Ireland, which
                has experienced uneven and unequal development over the last 30
                years or more. That uneven development has led to social
                exclusion, which has underscored the political upheaval
                experienced within the restrictive political and geographic
                boundaries of this region. With devolution, the Assembly now has
                the opportunity to deliver real change to Northern Ireland and
                to implement a sustainable and comprehensive regional
                development strategy that can, as the Programme for Government
                states, make a difference to the everyday lives of our people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the draft regional development
                strategy’s recognition that the promotion of social cohesion,
                together with economic development, is of critical importance
                along with the promotion of equality of opportunity and spatial
                equity throughout the region as a whole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key objectives of any comprehensive
                regional development strategy should include the following:
                balanced and sustainable growth; social and economic inclusion;
                protection of the physical, natural and man- made assets of the
                region; and the provision of a spatial framework for the
                development of key public services. All those factors are
                addressed, and, importantly, the regional development strategy
                recognises the needs of both urban and rural communities. The
                spatial development strategy promotes a balance between urban
                and rural development and takes into consideration the
                environment and the quality of life. It is of fundamental
                importance that urban and rural development must co-exist and
                complement each other. Increased urbanisation should not be
                regarded as the primary economic driver.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concept of decentralisation of services
                is addressed in the RDS, and that is welcome. However, the
                Executive should lead by example. Entire sections of Government
                Departments should be relocated from Belfast to what the RDS
                designates as the main urban hubs. Such a policy would help us
                to achieve more balanced growth beyond the Greater Belfast area.
                Overall, the regional development strategy is innovative and
                dynamic. It addresses many of our concerns about issues covered
                in earlier drafts, and contains many positive proposals relating
                to urban and rural development, transportation strategy, housing
                needs, environmental concerns and the tourism infrastructure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Transport policy should include the core
                principles of equality, choice, efficiency and accessibility, as
                well as taking into consideration environmental concerns and
                public safety. The regional development strategy takes an
                innovative look at how to obtain the right mix of private and
                public transport. The strategy recognises that, if economic
                development and social inclusion are to be encouraged, Northern
                Ireland needs an integrated transportation system. I am pleased
                to find that the strategy contains some new proposals for
                improving public transport. However, it is a long-term policy,
                with targets set over a period of 10 years. More needs to be
                done in the medium term to enhance public transport and make it
                a viable option for commuters. We all await the regional
                transportation strategy because of its vital role in enabling
                the regional development strategy to be realised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commitments to improve cross-border road
                and rail links are also welcome. It is important that the
                transport infrastructure be upgraded in an all-Ireland and
                European context. The measures to upgrade the roads in rural
                Northern Ireland are long overdue, and I am pleased to read that
                the strategy proposes a more integrated approach to
                transportation in rural areas. That will improve accessibility,
                with the objective of sustaining rural communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a welcome acknowledgement in the
                strategy that different parts of the region require different
                planning processes. Developments in the Belfast travel-to-work
                area must be more constrained. I am from a rural area and,
                therefore, have not been heavily involved in the discussions on
                brownfield development. However, I welcome the fact that the
                Minister has set more challenging targets for brownfield
                development in Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The expansion of the North’s links with the
                rest of the world is of key importance for the economic
                development of the region. Our airports and seaports must be
                developed. The ports at Warrenpoint and Lisahally provide an
                important service to their respective hinterlands.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional development strategy is an
                imaginative document, which has the capacity to address the
                problems associated with uneven development in the region. Its
                proposals are not rigid and can be adapted and tailored as
                circumstances require to ensure that the principles of equality
                and social justice remain at its core. During the consultation
                period, my party suggested that the regional development
                strategy should be reviewed every five years to assess its
                success in meeting its objectives and assess the need for any
                adjustments. We welcome the Minister’s commitment in that
                regard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We welcome the fact that district councils
                will be consulted in the coming months on how they can play an
                active role in the implementation of the strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As ‘Shaping Our Future’ states, it is
                vital that we obtain a more joined-up and co-ordinated approach
                that meets the needs of local communities, and we welcome the
                commitment given to participate in the decision- making process.
                In the past, the North did not have any proper development
                proposals that sought to achieve social equity as well as
                economic regeneration.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the Department
                implements a sustainable regional development strategy with the
                capacity and flexibility to meet the developing needs of the
                region and to improve the quality of life for everyone in
                Northern Ireland irrespective of location or class.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome what the Minister said about
                implementation and trying to promote stronger co-operation
                between the Department for Regional Development and the
                Department of the Environment. That is vital as we try to
                realise implementation over the next 20 years. Decentralisation
                was flagged up and it is contained in the document in a positive
                way that will be good for the entire region.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister for Regional
                Development in bringing the draft to the Assembly. In
                particular, I endorse the remarks made concerning the
                Warrenpoint and Londonderry ports. I had the pleasure of touring
                both ports, and I saw the valuable work that they do and the
                great potential for development there. I hope that none of us
                will forget the Belfast port — how could we? The House will
                return to that subject before too long when it looks at the
                future of the port and the surrounding land that could be
                developed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join the Minister in his words of praise
                and commendation for those who were closely associated with the
                preparation of the draft strategy; the team leader, in
                particular. From my sojourn in that Department I know about the
                valuable work that he and his team have done and how reliable
                they are. I congratulate him on being awarded the CBE. Many
                people will see that as a well-deserved honour, and I am sure
                that the Assembly congratulates him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must not forget the director of the
                regional plan team who was also closely associated with the
                preparation of the report, and the deputy secretary who had an
                overseeing role. From my days in the Department I know that the
                permanent secretary was very supportive of the project; he put a
                lot of enthusiasm into it and gave a great deal of encouragement
                to those who were involved. They will all be delighted — even
                to simply get it out of their office — to see it come to this
                stage of preparation and fruition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the Assembly recognise
                the considerable work that went into producing the pictures and
                text in front of us and the work carried out by the independent
                panel that consulted perhaps more widely than for any previous
                consultation on Government policy. It provided a report that I
                was happy to receive when I was Minister for that Department and
                am happy to welcome now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It might be worthwhile, while I am in the
                praising mood, to mention the Committee for Regional
                Development. I am sure that the Minister benefited from its work
                to the same extent as I did. The Committee provided me with
                valuable advice about the plan, as I am sure it did for the
                Minister, and it has made its mark on the draft that was
                produced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to deal with two issues that seem to
                have changed from when I was more intimately involved with the
                preparation of the plan. I would like to know the Department’s
                thinking on these matters. First, there is the status of the
                report. There had been a legal basis for the report, which is
                set out on page three of the draft. The Strategic Planning
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1999 requires Northern Ireland
                Departments to</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;have regard to the regional development
                strategy&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">in exercising any functions in relation to
                development. In particular, planning policy, development plans
                and development schemes prepared by the Department of the
                Environment and the Department for Social Development are
                required in future to be</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;consistent with the regional
                development strategy.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report says that this means that in
                practice they should be in broad harmony with the strategic
                objectives and policies of the regional development strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that an attempt has been made in that
                &quot;addendum&quot; to give some type of definition to the
                legislation, which says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;consistent with the regional
                development strategy&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, page 200 of the report, which covers
                the legal framework, states — as the Minister did — that we
                can expect proposals to be brought before the Assembly in the
                near future, if the Assembly survives. The proposals will
                promote amending legislation, which would substitute the
                original wording with a requirement that development plans</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;must be in general conformity with the
                regional development strategy&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that lawyers could make a meal out
                of the difference between the words &quot;consistent with&quot;
                and &quot;in broad conformity with&quot;. As a layman, I would
                be happy if the Minister told me why it is necessary to bring in
                amending legislation to change the wording. Are people unhappy
                with their Departments acting consistently with the regional
                development strategy? Why have we produced what seems to be a
                more flexible or loose approach to the strategy? I would like to
                know the reasoning behind the slight of hand in the draft. It
                may be that there is no major reason behind it — alarm bells
                may be ringing unnecessarily.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second issue, raised by the Deputy
                Chairperson of the Committee, concerns brownfield sites. The
                most significant policy statement in the regional development
                strategy deals with the issue of brownfield and greenfield
                development. Anyone who has taken a careful interest throughout
                the process will be aware of the evolution of the strategy in
                that regard. The Regional Development Committee is correct in
                drawing attention to such a key issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a Member for a Belfast constituency, I see
                the absolute necessity of revitalising the inner-city parts of
                Belfast. Even the middle of the city needs to be revitalised. I
                am sure that Members can advance similar cases for more rural
                areas. The public examination recommended 40% brownfield
                development. The latest graphs show a target of 60%, but the
                target is dependent on the urban capacity studies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the direction of the policy
                aspiration. However, I am not convinced about how it advances
                the brownfield site case to have a target of 40% or 60%. I
                suspect it is more likely to be used in areas as a maximum
                rather than a target. For example, what argument would be
                advanced if, in a town somewhere in Northern Ireland, they can
                produce brownfield sites representing 80% of the requirement?
                Would people simply stay at the figure of 60%, rather than go
                beyond it? Under the draft, they might have to stop at 60%, but
                I am sure that that was not the intention of the report. The
                House can agree that we should strive to encourage as much
                brownfield development as possible. That would be consistent
                with concerns that many of us have about town cramming.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a representative of a local government
                borough, I am appalled by the number of applications for high-
                density apartment developments, almost invariably to be built in
                existing residential areas where one or two houses will be
                knocked down with perhaps 10 or 20 being built in their place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a danger that putting a quota on
                brownfield development will force the planning department
                towards town cramming. However, brownfield development is good
                not only because it helps to regenerate inner- and middle-city
                areas, but it breathes new life into areas that have become
                run-down and dilapidated over the years. It offers those areas a
                fresh start and revitalisation for communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Brownfield development also brings an
                economic boost to shopkeepers in inner- and middle-city areas
                who must vie with the out-of-town shopping centres and major
                supermarket developments that have eaten into the retail market.
                It is a more sustainable form of development and enables the
                provision of a more effective public transport system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A key difficulty we face in encouraging
                people to get out of their cars and onto public transport is
                land-use pattern. That has made the provision of an effective
                public transport system almost impossible. Northern Ireland is a
                society that has two and a half times as many road miles as the
                rest of the UK, and disparate settlement patterns are not easily
                accommodated by any public transport system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy will not solve all our problems,
                but it is a start. Over the next 30 years it will give us an
                opportunity to make a difference to some of the problems that
                have been created over the past 30 years. That is why land- use
                planning is so important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted that we now have a strategic
                framework for Northern Ireland which will soon be backed by the
                Belfast metropolitan area plan and the other area plans so that
                we can move forward strategically on planning matters. For too
                long planning applications for major developments have come
                forward on a piecemeal basis, often decided by article 31
                inquiries that form no part of the overall planning strategy but
                rather are developer led.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I am concerned that the percentage
                figure is being submitted. Regardless of what the urban capacity
                study brings forward as available brownfield sites, should we
                not use the maximum number of sites, no matter what that number
                might be? We should tie ourselves to the outcome of the urban
                capacity study rather than to an artificial or aspirational
                figure. The Committee — and I suspect the Minister — has
                made it very clear that the aspiration is to use the maximum
                number of sites under the urban capacity study. Can the Minister
                tell me the advantage of putting a percentage figure into the
                draft, as opposed to a requirement, that the planners operate on
                the maximum number of sites in the urban capacity study?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I would like to alert the Minister
                to something. Every Member of the House has probably received a
                letter from the Construction Employers Federation (it arrived
                with general Assembly correspondence). For those of us who have
                the instinctive ability to read between the lines, it is fairly
                clear that in that communication the potential for legal
                challenge is being pointed up, should the Minister depart from
                the procedures that have been laid down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister satisfied that if he departs
                from the panel’s report in this way, that he will not find
                that the courts, as opposed to the Assembly, will decide the
                report? The construction industry may well say that it was not
                consulted about the change. What steps can he take to ensure
                that the primacy for the future of development is with the
                Assembly rather than with the courts?</p>

                I want to make a few brief points on the draft regional
                development strategy. At the outset I have to say that I am
                somewhat concerned about the unfortunate timing of the debate.
                This document sets out the strategic framework for the
                development of this part of Ireland for the next 25 years. It
                comes to the Assembly when some people are in recess mode or in
                resignation mode, and the importance of this document has been
                overshadowed by other events today. There might have been a more
                appropriate time for this matter to be debated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an important document, and it will
                have interdepartmental consequences. It will be an overarching
                strategy, which will guide the strategies of individual
                Departments in relation to housing and other development,
                transportation, the environment and economic development. Given
                this, I recommend that all Members consider this the final form
                of the document and take on board its content. As a strategic
                document it is significant, for it will influence the shaping of
                this region for the next 25 years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear from the Minister’s
                contribution and from discussions we have had with departmental
                officials over the last few months that they have taken on board
                the views of the Regional Development Committee and of other
                Committees that contributed to the consultation on the document.
                Each of the issues raised by the Committee during the
                consultation has been listened to and dealt with in the
                redrafting of the document. As a member of the Regional
                Development Committee, I welcome the praise and thanks that the
                Minister and other Members have expressed to the Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the issues raised at the outset was
                the sense of imbalance in the initial draft of the document with
                its focus on the Belfast metropolitan area and the city of
                Derry, as opposed to the rural regions of the North. The
                document now indicates that there will be a balanced approach to
                the entire region. In identifying the key transport corridors
                and the regional centres and rural hubs, it has addressed
                concerns about the overemphasis on the Belfast metropolitan area
                as opposed to the rural areas. In stating that, while the
                document sets out to promote equality of life and availability
                of services to everyone, we have to bear in mind that two thirds
                of the population of this region live in smaller towns and the
                countryside.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The section on transportation addresses the
                existing rail network provision, while the overall aim of the
                document is to provide a vision of development in the next 25
                years. The rail network in the Belfast metropolitan area and the
                key links between Belfast and Derry, and Belfast and Dublin, are
                examined. However, I am disappointed that, although this is a
                vision document, it does not deal with the further development
                and expansion of the rail network between, for instance,
                Portadown, Armagh, Dungannon, Omagh, Strabane and Derry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recent months a significant part of the
                Committee’s time has been spent in establishing appropriate
                levels of brownfield site development and discussing the
                overzoning which has taken place in area plans. There was an
                initial concern that the Belfast metropolitan area was being
                overemphasised. However, that area has — and will continue to
                have — the largest population and the highest level of
                economic activity in the region, and its development is
                important to the whole region. At present Belfast metropolitan
                area is expanding, but the city centre is declining, and much of
                that centre is relatively underpopulated. A target for the
                development of brownfield sites is needed to deal with this. I
                welcome the Minister’s statement that there needs to be a
                clear signal in regard to the development of brownfield sites.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the land database has been completed and
                assessed, there will need to be a much more ambitious target for
                the Belfast metropolitan area than would be feasible or
                achievable in any other urban centre in the region. We will need
                to revisit this matter when the land database is completed and
                when we are assessing the potential in that field.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document is strategy-based, and it will
                only be successful if it is effectively implemented. The
                Minister proposed the introduction of amending legislation to
                create a requirement that other Departments’ policies be
                &quot;in general conformity&quot; rather than consistent with
                the regional development strategy. This amendment is designed to
                create more flexibility in the planning system. I accept that
                point, but I hope that the term &quot;must be in general
                conformity&quot; will not weaken the basic strategy inherent in
                the document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An interdepartmental steering group of
                officials, chaired by the Minister, to monitor the progress of
                the strategy’s implementation, is proposed. The group will
                report annually to the Assembly, and I am sure that the Minister
                for Regional Development and the officials on this steering
                group at any given time will be very capable. However, I hope
                that during the monitoring process, there will be ongoing
                consultation with other Committees and Ministers on the
                implementation of the strategy</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the departmental officials who had to
                endure the many questions raised by Committee members, who were
                not prepared to accept woolly answers. The officials considered
                our concerns and returned to the Committee several times before
                producing their final draft.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is much to commend the strategy
                document, and for that I praise the Minister and his officials.
                However, I have some concerns. There is little point in
                repeating what other Members have said, but I concur with the
                points that Mr Peter Robinson and Mr McNamee made about how
                determined we must be to see the strategy implemented.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a couple of difficulties with the
                strategy. I do not believe that it adequately defines the
                requirements — I emphasise the word &quot;requirements&quot;
                — of our society with regard to greenfield and brownfield
                development. The Minister has the capacity to create a new
                ethos. I have said that before. Rather than go round counting
                brownfield sites and the number of buildings that might be
                erected on such sites, we should be proactive in the development
                and creation of brownfield sites.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should encourage developers to believe
                that there is a genuine opportunity and that they should use
                brownfield sites because they will have to wait a long time for
                a greenfield site. We have not addressed the matter fully. The
                strategy document says that the proportion of housing
                development in urban areas should be double the current level of
                25-30%. That means 50% to, at most, 60%. In that respect, the
                document does not set out a clear indicator or indicate a
                decisive, determined attitude on the part of the Minister and
                the Assembly. It is not enough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vehicular travel is up by 3%, although we
                have a policy of asking people to use public transport, to use
                bicycles or to walk. Brownfield sites are already on transport
                corridors, which would ensure that people have ample opportunity
                to avail themselves of the daily services that pass by their
                door, street or avenue. There is much to commend the strategy,
                and I do not want to be too churlish, but I must flag up the
                fact that that issue will be raised repeatedly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Overzoning will disrupt the percentage
                balance between brownfield and greenfield development. I want
                someone to do the mathematics and tell me that we will maintain
                the balance between brownfield and greenfield sites at the rate
                that the Minister and the Assembly would like. We are not likely
                to overzone too many brownfield sites, but we will overzone
                greenfield sites. The Minister must consider that carefully.
                There should not have been any overzoning. It has been of
                benefit only to the developer, against the best interests of our
                society. Perhaps that is not what the Department has in mind,
                but that is what has happened.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a valuable and important document,
                which sets out a plan for the strategic development of Northern
                Ireland over the next 25 years. It is a tremendously important
                tome. While other Members have focused mainly on the brownfield/greenfield
                variation, I want to come to that at a later stage, along with
                other issues.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to point out what I think is one of
                the most serious flaws in this regional development strategy. I
                have done a little research of my own, and I have discovered
                that Northern Ireland has the highest birth rate and one of the
                youngest populations in the European Union. Yet this regional
                development strategy concentrates more on our cars than on our
                kids. If you typed the word &quot;children&quot; in to your
                computer you could count on your fingers the number of times it
                would come up. If you typed in the word &quot;car&quot; it would
                be there — you would need more than 100 fingers to count the
                number of times it came up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a car culture, instead of a kid
                culture. It is disgraceful that 26% of this population is under
                the age of 17 and, according to our regulations, cannot drive a
                car, and yet there is virtually nothing to accommodate kids and
                young people in this regional development strategy. That is
                about 400,000 children — if my calculations are correct. Where
                are children and young people to be found here?</p>

                developments are being built, but there is no public transport,
                no community facilities and not one children’s play area.
                However, there is plenty of room for cars to be parked.</p>

                adequate and appropriate provision for parking — I am assuming
                that it is referring to our cars, not our kids. There is not one

                is a huge lack. I am appealing to civil servants for just one
                more addition saying &quot;communal play areas for kids&quot;.
                In creating areas of new high-density housing development, we
                are establishing a kid in a cul-de-sac culture. How many people
                move in to new housing developments and find that their kids
                have nowhere to play but on the streets between the cars? We

                words into action. We need to change our priorities and to focus
                our energy away from cars and onto our kids.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must use legislation to oblige developers
                to provide communal children’s play areas as well as other
                community needs. We also need to develop a children’s play
                strategy at local council level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also essential that we have a youth
                leisure strategy that includes free outdoor facilities for our
                youth. For example, what about a skateboard park? A BMX track?
                Go-kart racing? Cheaper rates for children in leisure centres
                and on public transport are vital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will turn to road safety, which is an
                essential part of this strategy. I was flabbergasted to see that
                road safety merits five lines on page 172 of the strategy. We
                need greater emphasis on road safety for the sake of our kids,
                including obligatory traffic-calming measures around schools and
                in residential areas. We need greatly reduced speed limits;
                stricter enforcement of speed regulations; the use of walking
                buses to schools; and cycle tracks on main roads and on routes
                to and from schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will admit that the regional development
                strategy is a good start. We must get it right, and getting our
                priorities right is the way to do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My last recommendations are as follows. We
                need a community impact assessment to impose an obligation on
                developers to consult communities when new developments are
                going up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the subject of brownfield versus
                greenfield sites, it has all been said. We agree absolutely with
                Mr Robinson that it should go beyond 60% for brownfield
                development, and I thank him for putting that point to us so
                that we can make it loud and clear. Brownfield must be the
                priority, and it must go beyond 60%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I ask for much stricter laying down
                of legislation and targets — and not only targets for
                brownfield and greenfield sites, but for issues such as waste
                recycling, CO2 emissions, cutting greenhouse gases, play areas
                and youth leisure. We need targets, targets, targets.
                Administrators, civil servants and Ministers should not be
                scared to be tough on this one. We need change, and we need it
                now for the good of our kids.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having had very little time to digest the
                report, my comments will be brief. First, I welcome the new
                acceptance by the Minister and his Department of listening to
                the community and the Committee. I hope that that continues
                throughout the years ahead.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland’s population is
                increasing, and more and more people want their own homes —
                and rightly so. This report tries to set out a strategy to
                encourage and manage this growth. Laudable as that aim is, the
                report fails in several crucial ways both the current and the
                future population. I hope that improvements will be made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report predicts the need for an
                additional 160,000 houses in the next 15 years, with a need for
                a total of 250,000 by the year 2025. This demand may lead to the
                urbanisation of a further 30 sq miles, which is the equivalent
                of the creation of a new city. I do not know what other Members
                think, but I cannot fathom where this new building is going to
                take place. Will our villages start to sprawl? Will our towns
                suffer from overdevelopment? These are very serious questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much has already been said with regards to
                brownfield/ greenfield areas for development — and rightly so.
                Alliance is committed to ensuring that at least 50%, and up to
                60%, or whatever is available of new developments, are built on
                brownfield land. This is the only way we can protect the rural
                countryside and the greenfields in and adjacent to the cities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report recognises the importance of this
                strategy, but, rather than embracing it now to apply to future
                developments, it suggests that a target of 50% to 60% be
                achieved in 10 years. This is a target set for the whole of the
                region rather than a particular part of Northern Ireland. Little
                or not enough mention is made of development in the Belfast
                metropolitan area and its hinterlands — an area from which,
                according to this report, half of the demand for the new houses
                will come.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, this report allows for
                overzoning of 10% in existing plans. I am not happy with this
                proposal, and it ought to be dropped altogether. How can we talk
                about planned growth when we are already admitting that our
                plans may need to allow for more houses, more demands on
                infrastructure and more development? We must make our priorities
                clear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Growth must be managed and sustainable. We
                simply cannot permit overzoning. We must encourage renovation.
                We need a commitment to conversion of existing buildings
                wherever possible, rather than demolition. When new building is
                unavoidable, it should be allowed only when the replacement
                buildings constitute architectural gain. This report does little
                to protect architectural heritage. Whenever possible, we must
                encourage brownfield development. This report does not go far
                enough in those areas, and we would like — demand even — to
                see greater protection of all our green areas whilst encouraging
                growth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I ask the Minister and his
                Department to keep on listening to what the community is saying
                and to act accordingly.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of the Environment (Mr Foster):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister for Regional
                Development and his Department on bringing forward the regional
                development strategy. It reflects a great deal of thought and
                hard work. My officials also put a great deal of time and effort
                into framing the Department’s input to the process. The
                strategy will be an important element in the overall framework
                of planning policy. It will provide a guide for the preparation
                of development plans by the Department of the Environment, and
                it will assist citizens and developers in understanding the
                policy context within which specific proposals for physical
                development will be considered by the Planning Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Against that background, I am grateful to the
                Minister for Regional Development for agreeing to bring forward
                an amendment to the Strategic Planning Order to make the
                relationship between the strategy and the development plans more
                flexible. The Minister is aware of my concern that the strategy
                should be sufficiently flexible to be able to accommodate
                unforeseen demographic social, economic and technological
                changes. That is essential, because no one can predict how all
                those variables will move over 25 years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not only circumstances that can change
                over time. The strategy before the House contains many
                expressions of policy, including over 40 strategic planning
                guidelines. All Ministers and Departments will be obliged to
                have regard to those in the discharge of their development
                functions. It is possible, even likely, that the current policy
                preferences of Ministers and the Assembly, as embedded in the
                strategy, will change as time passes. It is important that the
                processes for reviewing and revising the strategy are responsive
                and expeditious. I have recommended that to Mr Campbell, and I
                am grateful that he has made adjustments accordingly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two statements of policy in the strategy
                deserve particular attention in that regard. First is the target
                for increasing the proportion of housing development on
                brownfield sites. I sympathise with that aspiration because of
                its relevance to the Department of the Environment’s
                commitment to sustainable development. It is hoped that the
                target can be achieved, but I am obliged to the Minister for
                Regional Development for accepting my suggestion that the
                impacts of that policy be carefully monitored. That intention is
                now reflected in the text.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My concern is primarily with the interests of
                those people on lower incomes and first-time house buyers.
                Members are conscious of the rise in house prices and of the
                financial strain that that places on many of our constituents
                — notwithstanding the benefit of historically low mortgage
                lending rates. It is possible, though not inevitable, that the
                policy of brownfield development could put further pressure on
                land and house prices. The strategy predicts the need for up to
                250,000 extra dwellings over the next 25 years, so there will be
                a lot of demand on the system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of the Environment will do its
                best to ensure an adequate supply of brownfield land through the
                development plan process. I am glad to say that as a result of
                the Executive’s Budget for 2001-02, the Department of the
                Environment is achieving a greater degree of forward momentum on
                development planning. However, Members must not lose sight of
                the fact that sustainable development has social and economic as
                well as environmental objectives, and that affordable housing is
                an important dimension of social inclusion. Therefore the
                Assembly has a duty to monitor the impacts of this policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy also touches on many other
                aspects of the public interest. Existing retail planning policy
                seeks to balance the interests of consumers with the objective
                of maintaining the vitality and viability of town centres. The
                strategy makes specific reference to Belfast city centre. I am
                sure that Members share the desire that the strategy will be
                successful in providing an alternative retail offer to the
                citizens of Belfast and beyond. I am taking assurance from the
                fact that a number of consortia have proposals for major retail
                developments in the city centre. The Department of the
                Environment has already received planning applications for two
                of those.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is hoped that the strategy has maintained
                an appropriate balance between the objectives of maintaining the
                vitality of Belfast city centre and of promoting the interests
                of our citizens and constituents as consumers. Planning policy
                exists to promote the public interest, not to maintain the
                existing patterns of economic and commercial activity through
                protectionism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy is an important document which
                has widespread implications for all public services and for the
                citizens of Northern Ireland. I have drawn attention to what I
                believe to be some of the strategy’s most important features.
                It is hoped that the strategy will prove to be an effective and
                flexible addition to the framework of planning policy. The
                Department of the Environment will seek to play its full part in
                translating its provisions into better planning development
                throughout the region.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A substantial number of people have asked to
                speak. Since there has been no time limit on the first round of
                Members speaking, it is now necessary to impose a time limit of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional development strategy is
                undoubtedly one of the most significant publications that will
                pass through the Assembly in the foreseeable future — however
                long or short the political future of the House might be. I was
                pleased to hear the Minister referring to his plans for the next
                session of the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his courtesy in
                paying attention to individual Members during his attendance at
                Committee meetings — everyone got a fair hearing. His
                willingness to listen is appreciated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The views of a wide and varied section of the
                people of Northern Ireland have been condensed and presented in
                this 200-plus page draft report as the way to shape our future
                for the next quarter of a century at least — as our population
                moves toward the two million mark.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have selected a few sections of the draft
                to which I attach special significance. I welcome the rural
                development objectives identified to promote an attractive and
                prosperous rural area, and the importance attached to a
                co-ordinated and integrated approach. The essential need for
                rural-proofing of policies and rural participation as identified
                are both welcome inclusions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that the agricultural and farming
                community come in for little or no mention in the draft.
                Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the rural-proofing aspect of
                the programme will adequately deal with farming matters when the
                opportunities arise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the same section, I welcome the paragraphs
                relating to matters such as local housing needs and the
                continuing development of long-established rural communities.
                The desire to reinforce those communities is to be welcomed.
                However, from the unfortunate experience of so many communities
                throughout Northern Ireland recently, this may be difficult to
                achieve as those with hidden agendas continue to move in on
                unsuspecting rural neighbourhoods, which results in an eventual
                loss of identity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards greenbelts, areas of outstanding
                natural beauty and other designated rural areas, I accept that
                such levels of protection in the Mournes and elsewhere are
                inevitable. Having said that, some effort would have to be made
                to address the financial burden imposed upon those who, because
                of the environmental regulations, are prohibited from building a
                dwelling even for a family member on land that they own within
                the confines of restricted zones. Members from the Glens of
                Antrim and other policy areas will understand the sense of
                unfairness that planning refusals bring to the young people of
                such areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that the acceptance of brownfield
                sites in rural areas, just as in the proposal for urban areas,
                would present an opportunity to build, once proof that a
                dwelling once stood there is established. A brownfield rural
                policy could be developed, and I am certain that a degree of
                acceptance would be forthcoming from applicants on matters
                relating to the requirements on size, design and setting of such
                rural dwellings. Such approval would also help to provide the
                affordable housing referred to by the Minister, as the purchase
                price of a site would, in most cases, be nil.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft goes into reasonable detail on
                economic issues, and the need to develop modern infrastructures
                is clearly identified. The need to increase links with
                neighbouring regions and to capitalise on trans-regional
                development opportunities is also highlighted. This is long
                overdue recognition of the economic potential that exists along
                the eastern seaboard of the island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any proposal that can bring forward the
                upgrading to European route status of the link road between
                Larne and Rosslare is to be welcomed. Needless to say the
                complete upgrading of the stretch of the A1 from Loughbrickland
                to the border still remains one of the economic priorities of
                business people, road users and people from the Newry and south
                Down areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the issue of infrastructure, I call on the
                relevant Departments to look seriously at the need to provide
                well-planned ring roads around developing towns. Every road into
                and out of Newry is jammed with traffic on an almost all-day
                basis due to the ongoing developments on the periphery and the
                lack of vision of those responsible for planning ahead. I am
                sure that many Members in this Assembly can identify with the
                situations I am describing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chapter 10 contains a section dealing with
                the promotion of regional gateways as economic development
                opportunities. There is a reference in that section to my home
                port of Warrenpoint. The importance of the port, and the
                challenges faced in the years ahead, have been referred to by
                previous Secretaries of State, Ministers and those in
                responsible positions with economic interest. I would be
                grateful if the Minister for Regional Development would give an
                assurance that he and his Department will provide maximum
                support to help meet the needs identified by Warrenpoint Harbour
                Authority as it goes about shaping the port’s future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that many of the mistakes
                made in the designing and planning of our residential
                developments are to be corrected. For example, I am pleased that
                open space retention and speed restrictions within estates are
                to be the subject of major planning legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister should, in conjunction with the
                district councils, conduct a study that would identify public
                rights of way that could be reopened. The proposed legislation
                on access to the countryside will probably throw up many
                problems. Reopening our rights of way might solve those
                problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join the Minister in paying tribute to his
                officials and the staff who worked with the Committee on the
                effort that has gone into the latest draft. I am also pleased
                that the proposal that it might be financially prudent to
                abandon the maintenance of many rural roads, which we discussed
                at a meeting in the city centre, has not been included in the
                draft. I thank the Minister of the Environment for his
                attendance earlier in the debate. It was clear from his speech
                that the Department of the Environment has a major role to play
                alongside the Department for Regional Development in shaping our
                future.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join Members in paying tribute to the
                Minister and his officials. As a member of the Regional
                Development Committee, I know exactly what their input has been
                and how often they came to speak to us at short notice. They
                were always willing to listen and take our comments on board. I
                thank them publicly for that. Many Members have spoken at length
                about the major aspects of the strategy. I shall not repeat
                their comments. There are, however, several things relating to
                my constituency that must be highlighted.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will not win that argument.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot say whether 60% is the best figure
                for brownfield development. The Committee felt that there was a
                need to draw the attention of planners and developers to the
                fact that people are sick, sore and tired of the way that
                development is carried out willy-nilly throughout the country. I
                am delighted that that has been taken on board, and I trust that
                planners will listen to what has been said.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that 10% would be a maximum
                for zoning, and I am delighted that that is the case. The
                strategy refers to housing requirements and the need to widen
                opportunity and choice, to improve the supply and quality of
                housing and to promote sustainable development. It is important
                that we make provision for the first-time buyer. Many of us have
                been in that position and know exactly what it is like. There
                must be housing for people in the lower income bracket.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all realise that the transport system in
                Northern Ireland has been allowed to decline over the last few
                years. There have been many difficulties, especially with the
                railway network. Many of us were horrified when the Department’s
                representatives came to the Committee and were totally frank and
                honest about showing how horrendous the Northern Ireland railway
                network is and how it needs to be improved. I am delighted that
                this has been taken on board. We are already beginning to see
                changes in the railway network; new stock is being acquired, and
                there is a realisation of the need to improve the system. In my
                home town of Larne there is a need for a transport system
                connection with the boats and links to the European network.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The infrastructure of our road system is such
                that many of us have been left worrying that it has been allowed
                to get into such a state that it will take a long time to bring
                it up to a reasonable standard. I congratulate the Minister and
                the Department for beginning work on the A8 from Belfast to
                Larne. We look forward to that being finished, for we realise
                how important that road is.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I have one important question for
                the Minister. Can he tell the House how he will implement the
                strategy? We can talk about it; we can have the document in
                front of us, but how will it be implemented?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this wide-ranging document
                detailing the strategy for the development of Northern Ireland
                for the next 25 years, and I congratulate all the people
                involved. It is a massive document, and we can barely scratch
                the surface of it today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to make only a few points, one of
                which I have been making since I first saw the draft proposals
                which were presented to MLAs at an induction session in the
                Europa Hotel about three years ago. It was pointed out that the
                A29 from Newry to Coleraine, via Armagh, Dungannon and Cookstown,
                is still designated as only a link corridor. This road carries
                exceptionally heavy traffic, and, at times, has more heavy
                vehicles than the A4 coming west off the M1. I cannot understand
                how the towns of Newry, Armagh, Dungannon and Cookstown can be
                designated as main hubs without this road’s being upgraded.
                Much of the cross-border northbound traffic from Newry uses this
                route. These hub towns cannot play their proposed roles if the
                whole road system is inadequate. The internal road networks of
                Northern Ireland must be of equal importance, at least, to other
                proposed cross-frontier routes towards Sligo and Monaghan.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The historic underfunding of the road network
                in the western rural region needs to be redressed, with priority
                being given to the upgrading of the routes associated with the
                key transport corridors, link corridors and the trunk roads. I
                look forward to seeing an upgraded and integrated transport
                network for the entire western region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the points made in the strategy
                document about strengthening the present rail system. Again, I
                must plug the west. We lost our entire rail system in the 1950s,
                and no further consideration has been given to any western link.
                A link, perhaps along the M1 going west to Fermanagh, and a
                similar system to the TGV or Deutsche Bahn networks in France
                and Germany, would have been welcome. Road congestion can be
                averted only when a more radical approach is taken to remove
                heavy lorries and the single occupancy of other vehicles. These
                must be replaced by a reliable transport system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Walking and cycling are to be greatly
                encouraged. However, they will only develop with safer roads and
                with a healthy education policy in schools. Public transport in
                rural areas must be of a quality and availability that will
                ensure accessibility for everyone wishing to use it. People
                cannot access education, training provisions and even employment
                without a decent road system. It is an issue which must be
                addressed if the strategy is to be achieved fully.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the intention on pages 96 and 97 to
                sustain and extend forestry resources in Northern Ireland, which
                is the least wooded region in Europe, with only 6% coverage
                compared with the European Union average of 32%. Our woodlands
                need to be expanded and protected, but we must not forget our
                hedgerows. Hedges are vitally important for wildlife.
                Stewardship is required to protect the hedgerows and the large
                trees that are an important part of our hedgerows.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I particularly welcome the chapter on caring
                for the environment. It is up to us to ensure that the next
                generation, and subsequent generations, are educated and imbued
                with the urge to care for the environment in Northern Ireland,
                and that they do not make any more of it, as the cliché says.
                The environment needs to be protected from progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been a proliferation of
                telecommunication masts. Wind turbines are now the popular
                environmentally- friendly source of power being promoted. Will
                our mountains and hills be further defaced by wind turbines? Why
                must these turbines be at the skyline if the prevailing wind
                speed is greater below a ridge or high ground? That is true, if
                gardening magazines are to be believed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am disappointed with the brief reference to
                climatic change and global warming. Any person interested in the
                environment, or even in farming, knows that the change has
                already taken place, and it is taking place rapidly. I want more
                detailed study and research on climatic change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our built heritage, archaeological and
                architectural, also needs protecting. So many important
                buildings have been destroyed or demolished with derisory fines
                given to the culprits. Legislation for the protection of built
                heritage must be amended and strengthened. The Department needs
                to be totally committed to prosecuting those who ignore
                conservation orders. Consistent criteria for planners are also
                needed to ensure adequate protection of our built heritage and
                to control unsympathetic development in rural areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I ask that the proposals
                contained in the strategy be translated effectively into action.
                I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the draft regional development
                strategy. It is a very comprehensive report covering housing,
                transport, economic development and the environment, as well as
                rural development, which is often neglected. I will concentrate
                on chapter 7, the north -west region, which recognises Derry as
                the regional city and hub of the north-west.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft follows on from the original ‘Shaping
                Our Future’ document, which was warmly welcomed by Derry City
                Council. That report recognised Derry for the first time as not
                only the regional capital of the north-west but also as the
                second city of Northern Ireland. The draft regional development
                strategy further strengthens Derry’s position in Northern
                Ireland. For example, strategic objectives state that Derry will
                have a pivotal role in cross-border and international trading
                relationships.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Derry is already the main urban centre for
                the north- west of the island and is also a proven bridge for
                investment, particularly between America and Europe. It is
                recognised as one of the fastest growing urban centres in the
                region over the last 25 years. It has a young, expanding
                population, with a number of new hi-tech jobs, but it is also
                recognised that there is a decline in traditional employment in
                the textile industry, for example. There is also a high level of
                unemployment in the region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The importance of the cross-border element is
                recognised as critical to our development, and I welcome the
                commitment to encourage further cross-border working for mutual
                benefit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the draft report’s recognition
                that the economy of the north-west is central to the region. A
                key focus of that is the development into Donegal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the commitment on page 85 to
                examine the potential for the improvement of transport links to
                and from the Port of Lisahally, the industrial areas at Maydown
                and Campsie and the City of Derry Airport. I warmly endorse
                those proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The section on rural Northern Ireland
                recognises the importance of the rural economy to the rest of
                Northern Ireland. Page 86 states that continuing management of
                the rural environment is essential to maintain the distinctive
                rural landscapes, which are important environmental economic
                resources. It is essential that these environmental assets be
                conserved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A summary of the key driving forces for rural
                change is on page 91, and it covers economic, social and
                environmental points. I endorse those points.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the annex, the guiding principles in the
                regional development strategy include a people-and community-
                focused approach; a sustainable approach to development;
                achieving a more cohesive society; achieving competitiveness;
                and adopting an integrated approach to the future development of
                the region. The rural development strategy will be monitored
                continually and reviewed formally every five years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also endorse the need for a proper
                transportation strategy for all of Northern Ireland and for the
                planning process to be part of the regional development
                strategy. That is critical for our future development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This important document provides a strategy
                for the next 25 years. I welcome it, and I congratulate the
                Minister for bringing it forward.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome this very useful document. It
                is probably not exhaustive, but it is comprehensive. It is not
                infallible. Some issues have not been addressed, but I do not
                have time to deal with those issues. There are other issues,
                which are in the document and which I want to prioritise in my
                remarks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise that this is an overarching
                strategic framework. It is not a blueprint or a master plan, as
                is acknowledged in the document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to my constituency, Upper Bann, I
                welcome the reference in chapter 9 to Craigavon and Banbridge as
                counter-magnets to the Belfast metropolitan area as regards
                housing needs. However, I cannot help but draw the conclusion
                that there appears to be a greater emphasis on the needs of the
                Belfast metropolitan area than on those of other areas of
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Craigavon is recognised as the third major
                growth area in Northern Ireland, and in that context I turn to
                the market towns of Portadown, Lurgan and Brownlow, and the
                reference on page 101 to town centres. There is a great
                opportunity to be creative and imaginative in the development
                and redevelopment of our town centres, in particular the
                existing brownfield sites. However, there is one important
                caveat. In order to be properly developed and exploited, some of
                the brownfield sites require additional infrastructure so as to
                create and develop opportunity sites. In the implementation of
                the strategy I hope that due cognizance will be taken of the
                need to create additional infrastructure in the inner-town areas
                to develop brownfield sites that were hitherto landlocked.</p>

                habitats and wetlands. However, I want to draw the attention of
                the Minister, his co-Ministers and the Department to a
                phenomenon that has happened in the past few years — the undue
                flooding of certain pasture lands and arable lands that were
                hitherto used in commercial production. The agriculture industry
                cannot afford the permanent loss of traditional pasture land and
                arable land, and I would like to think that recognition will be
                given to what I call the traditional commercial lands, which in
                the interim have become wetlands, to ensure that that is not
                permanent. I hope that some action will be taken to bring those
                lands that were lost in the recent flooding phenomenon,
                particularly in the Upper Bann area and in the Birches area
                where I come from, back into commercial production.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In connection with transportation, Craigavon
                is on the main rail route from Belfast to Dublin and, as the
                third- largest growth area in Northern Ireland, is strategically
                placed for further development. I am thankful that recognition
                was given to that fact and that the strategic plan provides for
                8,500 houses. That represents about two thirds of what some
                professionals in the planning market want for Craigavon. The
                figure of 12,000 houses was mooted during the consultation
                process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Craigavon and Banbridge have a strong and
                successful business culture, and they are strategically placed
                on the Belfast to Dublin rail corridor. Reference was also made
                to the road from Portadown to Armagh — the A3 — which links
                the Northway with the M12 and the M1 and places Craigavon in an
                advantageous position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Craigavon has the best-value housing in
                Northern Ireland with average prices at approximately £20,000
                below those in Lisburn or Belfast. It also boasts Galen
                Pharmaceuticals, the only £1 million business in Northern
                Ireland and the recent winner of the Northern Ireland Innovation
                in Business award. I therefore commend Craigavon and Banbridge
                to the Minister, particularly with regard to their strategic
                position and the infrastructure that is already there, although
                improvements are required.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the increased focus given to the
                brownfield sites and support their increased use in future
                developments from both an environmental and a social point of
                view.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposals for the regional transportation
                system are particularly relevant to my constituency of East
                Antrim and to Northern Ireland in general. I am concerned at the
                amount of emphasis given to the Belfast to Dublin intercity
                links compared to other infrastructural linkages on an east/west
                basis. The document specifies the need for a high-quality
                intercity linkage between Belfast and Dublin, but it describes
                the need only for good linkages for other onward connections
                such as the ro-ro connection from Larne to Scotland; in other
                words those linkages are to be of a lesser quality. It is
                important that those high-quality linkages should be extended
                from Belfast to Larne. Larne should be included in the main
                emphasis on the eastern seaboard corridor.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document places emphasis on investment in
                the Dublin/Belfast area. It mentions the potential for a new
                motorway linking Lisburn to Newry and the possibility of a new
                rail commuter line for that area. No improvements are specified
                for the northern section that links Belfast and the majority of
                the population of Northern Ireland, through Larne, to Scotland.
                That is a vital route for our economy and for tourism, because
                the rural facility at Larne is an important way to encourage
                tourists to come to Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document describes the Belfast/Dublin
                corridor as a focus for economic development and tourism. I
                argue that there is a need to promote tourism and economic
                development in other areas through the east/west link.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to rail services, I welcome the
                Belfast metropolitan area plan’s stress on the importance of
                park- and-ride facilities and investment. However, the
                importance of the trans-European rail network to Larne has not
                been stated. The quality of the onward service to Larne is not
                emphasised to the same extent as other routes. This is an
                important route, not just in terms of the Belfast metropolitan
                area plan, but also in a European context. The bulk of the rail
                commuter traffic comes from the Carrickfergus area. However,
                unless there is investment in the rail service to Larne, the
                congestion that occurs at Mallusk will continue. By upgrading
                the rail service from Larne to Belfast, people can be encouraged
                to move from road to rail. The congestion that clogs up the
                Greater Belfast transport system affects onward transport to
                Ballymena, Londonderry, Coleraine, Magherafelt and the
                Newtownabbey area and is a major cause of delay in the transport
                system of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about the road network shown
                in diagram 11 — the regional strategic transport network. I
                noticed that the borough of Carrickfergus, which boasts a
                population of around 30,000, does not get a trunk road, a link
                road or a link corridor. No preference is expressed as to the
                quality of the road service that should connect Carrickfergus
                onward to Larne or back towards Belfast. Given that smaller
                towns such as Newcastle and Ballycastle are deemed to be worthy
                of connections using trunk networks, it is very strange that the
                document places no importance on the road system of a sizeable
                town like Carrickfergus. The transport systems for the coastal
                area of east Antrim must be reassessed. That area is of
                importance to the economy and to the future potential of tourism
                in Northern Ireland. I welcome much of the report, but some
                areas need to be addressed further.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the latest draft of the regional
                strategic framework document and the Minister’s comments on
                brownfield sites. I am concerned that so little time has been
                allowed to consider this important and far-reaching document. We
                have only had the document for two days; that is an inadequate
                amount of time to do it justice. The report will have a
                tremendous impact on many aspects of life in Northern Ireland,
                and we must get it right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Environment Committee, the Regional
                Development Committee and the Social Development Committee had
                concerns about previous drafts of this document, and I am
                pleased that some of our suggestions have been taken up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the inclusion of the 60% target for
                regional brownfield development, and I hope that that is a
                minimum target. I am, however, concerned that no specific target
                has been set for Belfast, the largest urban area in Northern
                Ireland. If the Department can undertake the complicated task of
                setting a target for the whole of Northern Ireland, I cannot
                understand why one cannot be set for the Belfast metropolitan
                area. Unless a specific target for brownfield development is set
                at this point, Belfast may face years of drift and insecurity
                until a goal is finally reached. That may not happen until the
                Belfast metropolitan plan is in place in 2005 or 2006.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to implement policies that will swell
                the capacity of the brownfield building industry. By setting
                specific brownfield targets for an urban area such as Belfast,
                site flow will be stimulated and the brownfield site base
                increased. The Department must take the lead in supporting that
                transition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the University of Ulster’s work
                in conducting the urban capacity project. It is essential that
                we know the location and extent of the brownfield sites before
                we can set realistic targets. A specific target for brownfield
                development is needed to support planning policies and
                enforcement in Belfast. It would ensure that planners direct
                developers to brownfield sites and encourage them to create
                attractive areas, rather than simply taking the easiest
                pickings. If we are to protect what is left of our greenfield
                sites, it is vital that we do not disrupt our settled community
                any further and cause even more social problems, as is happening
                in Belfast at the moment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The option of providing additional housing by
                converting existing buildings was mentioned. Incentives equal to
                the tax incentives for new build, to encourage the reuse and
                conversion of buildings rather than their demolition, would be
                welcome. I encourage the relevant Ministers to make strong
                representations to change the current situation. That would
                encourage the regeneration of our towns and cities, and at the
                same time maintain the character of the built environment. In
                general I welcome the strategy and hope that it becomes a
                reality.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the proposals. I know that
                they are only in draft form at the moment, but they are
                nonetheless very important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has raised several key issues
                that concern people in my constituency of Strangford and those
                further afield. These proposals form the basis for a regional
                development strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will mention a few issues that are
                important to the people whom I represent. We welcome the
                conclusion that the strategy should not designate major or key
                service centres or regional towns, a decision that is important
                for several reasons. The way in which the major service centres
                were designated in the former draft strategy was disastrous to
                the future of the borough of Ards, because it was based on the
                perceived ability of the district town to accommodate housing
                growth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem was exacerbated when ‘Strategy
                2010’, the Department’s economic development strategy,
                followed the ‘Shaping Our Future’ draft proposals and
                suggested that the emphasis on jobs growth should centre on the
                major service areas. That made it difficult for Ards Borough
                Council to attract much-needed industrial development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The borough of Ards, as many Members know,
                has suffered greatly, especially in recent times. Some 1,000
                jobs, mainly in the textile industries, have been lost. Any new
                strategy must pave the way for the attraction of new industries
                and ensure not only that sufficient land is available for
                industrial development but that the quest for new jobs is
                facilitated. We want to make sure that boroughs such as Ards
                have that opportunity, and I believe that that can happen as a
                result of this proposal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the Department to carry out further
                consideration of how the strategy should be revised in order to
                strike a balance between the efficiency of investment and
                inclusiveness. They would thereby find a solution to keep areas
                experiencing problems, such as the borough of Ards, at the
                forefront in the quest for jobs. We want to ensure that there is
                fair play in attracting jobs; that is why this regional
                development strategy is so important.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the fact that the report
                refers to link corridors, especially the A20. We strongly
                believe that it is important for us to develop the route between
                Ards and Belfast from an industrial point of view. It is the key
                to taking our products further afield, whether to the harbours
                at Belfast or Larne, or other areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also feel that there should be a strategy
                that advocates the extension of the E-way, which is mentioned in
                the strategy, to Comber and Newtownards. This is a light rapid
                transit route, and it is important that something along those
                lines be at least considered and financial assistance set aside
                for it. There is a vast build-up of traffic in all the areas
                coming from Ards and Comber, with people from Ards and Killinchy
                coming through Comber, and those from the Ards peninsula coming
                across from Bangor and using Ards town. This E-way may be a way
                of addressing some of our concerns in relation to transport.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will quickly hit on some other issues that
                we are concerned about. We believe there is a developer’s
                charter, which the Planning Service seems to be presently
                operating. We are concerned that the developer seems to be able
                to almost call the tune or fire the shots in relation to any
                development. Many Members have touched on brownfield
                development. Obviously, we believe that brownfield land should
                be used first. However, it is important that councils have the
                vesting powers to acquire that land, and we ask the Minister to
                look at this. The Minister mentioned diversification in the
                rural economy. That is certainly an issue of great importance
                for the area I represent. I ask the Minister to ensure that the
                rural economy is given that opportunity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding coastal zone management, one issue
                that some Members have touched on today has been global climate
                change. I make this point because when it comes to development,
                whether for the fishing industry in our area, or housing or
                business, the global climate change can be a significant factor
                in forcing or driving change in the area that we represent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One last point is in relation to the need for
                councils to be the catalyst in their areas. I am sure the
                Minister will touch on the role of councils and the role he
                perceives for them. The council role is vital for the regional
                development strategy framework, and together the councils and
                the Assembly can reach the objective to enliven and revitalise
                the communities we represent. I support what the Minister has
                said.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey, I ask you to be brief to allow the
                Minister time to respond.</p>
                <b>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing me
                to get in very briefly. I will go straight to the couple of
                concerns I have. We are looking at a draft document, and I
                certainly hope that the final document will reflect what those
                responsible will feel necessary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will begin by making a complaint that
                Strabane is not identified as a gateway on the map on page 45.
                On listening to radio reports, I note that there is a huge
                volume of traffic using the Strabane/Lifford crossing. This is a
                major North/South gateway and should be recognised as such.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On page 81 there is reference to the
                north-west development corridor running from Londonderry to
                Letterkenny. I would have thought that the Northern Ireland
                Assembly should be considering the development corridor running
                through the Foyle valley. The reference on page 83 to the
                extension of the natural gas pipeline to Londonderry should
                refer to Londonderry and beyond.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with P J Bradley’s comments on the
                vibrancy of the rural communities. This strategy reflects the
                ability of people to build, live and work in the rural
                community, should it be via greater recognition of existing
                sites in the countryside; and I would further extend that
                because there are always small pieces of land on a farm that
                cannot be used. The rural community should have greater leeway
                to utilise such land through the provision of additional
                housing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The spatial framework for tourism is covered
                on page 146. Is anybody in the Assembly going to tell me that
                Sion Mills does not have any industrial heritage? Are we being
                told that there are no castles in Tyrone and County Londonderry?
                That appears to be the case when you look at the map on that
                page. Apparently there are no forest parks west of Omagh, nor is
                there horse riding beyond the Mournes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr McNamee’s remarks, which
                were supported by Mrs Carson, about the re-establishment, or at
                least the thought of re-establishing, the circular rail route
                that once existed in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On page 150 of the report, which covers
                activity- based holidays, there is no mention of hunting,
                shooting and fishing. We all know that these are major sources
                of foreign income from tourists participating in those
                particular activities. Finally, on page 178, are we being told
                that there are no areas of natural beauty and no scenic quality
                west of the A4? I close with those remarks.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sympathise with Mr Beggs, who struggled a
                little with his paperwork towards the end of his speech. Given
                that I have had to listen to 17 contributions on a variety of
                topics, I am sure that he and others will sympathise with me as
                I try to respond to as many of them as possible. If there are
                issues that I inadvertently do not refer to specifically or in
                sufficient detail, my staff and the officials who are diligently
                taking notes will respond in writing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Members for their response to the
                document. It took a considerably long time to prepare, and it
                has been through the mill on several occasions with the
                Committee for Regional Development and other Committees. I
                respond positively to the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee,
                who asked for assurances that the monitoring of the strategy
                would be tackled diligently, and that an annual progress report
                be presented to the Committee. I assure him that that will be
                the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson and several others
                referred to public transport and railways. Given the knowledge
                that Members have about what formerly was called the
                &quot;consolidation option&quot;, I do not need to mention the
                difficulties we had in recent months regarding the railway
                system in Northern Ireland. I do not like the term
                &quot;consolidation option&quot;. However, it was used in the
                task force report, and the adoption by the Assembly of that
                option meant £105 million being spent merely to get the
                consolidation option. It is hoped that the money will be spent
                over the next three years on preserving the existing railway
                infrastructure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will understand that the expansion of
                the railway system to Armagh, north and south, Fermanagh,
                Tyrone, west of Omagh, and to all points north, south, east and
                west would require hundreds of millions of pounds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nonetheless, I remain in favour of railways
                and public transportation in general. I will require resources
                to put that into practice. I want to emphasise the commitment
                that exists in the regional development strategy to the
                transport proposals that will flow from it and be a part of it.
                I also want to assure the Deputy Chairperson that any
                non-compliance in the implementation of relevant measures will
                be closely monitored and acted on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members referred to harbours in their
                own areas. Warrenpoint and Londonderry harbours, and the others,
                have caused me much consideration. Members will also be aware
                that I am currently exploring what legislative changes could be
                brought about to allow those harbours to develop and to
                diversify. Naturally, I want to see a regional development
                strategy that would allow that to occur. I will be monitoring
                that closely, and I hope that the strategy will not only permit
                that, but will prompt harbour authority officers to take
                advantage of that change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members referred to the issue of
                brownfield development. As I suspected, that issue was to
                dominate Members’ contributions. Before focusing on it, I want
                to refer to an issue of general conformity that has taken up
                many hours in the Department for Regional Development and in the
                Department of the Environment: what steps can I take to ensure
                flexibility between the strategy and the development plans?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following receipt of legal opinion, I am
                going to promote amending legislation in the next session to
                substitute the regional development strategy for the requirement
                that development plans and development schemes must be in
                general conformity. These statutory provisions, including the
                proposed amendment, provide the legal framework in which
                implementation of the strategy will proceed. However, these
                provisions will be kept under review to ensure that they provide
                a sufficiently flexible, yet effective, legal framework. I am
                satisfied that the proposed change will still preserve the
                authority of the regional development strategy. I hope that that
                is helpful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many tributes were paid to the senior civil
                servants working on the strategy, and I concur with those. Mr
                Peter Robinson referred to a number of senior civil servants,
                notably the permanent secretary who will shortly be retiring
                after many years in the Department. I want to take this
                opportunity to commend him and to wish him well in his imminent
                retirement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I did not schedule today’s debate to
                coincide with any possible resignation or recess. In fact, as I
                said earlier, the regional development strategy has been through
                the mill several times with the Regional Development Committee
                and other Committees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any consideration of timing is in regard to
                the commitment I gave to the Minister of the Environment to try
                to present the current draft to the Assembly before the summer
                recess.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will discuss the important issue of
                brownfield percentages, which many Members mentioned. For many
                months a wide range of views has been expressed on this highly
                topical issue. Some were concerned that the Department would set
                too low a target for brownfield housing development. They felt
                that the target should be more in line with the English target
                of 60%. That concern was expressed by the Belfast Metropolitan
                Residents Group.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Others, however, were equally concerned that
                the target might be too high and would unnecessarily stifle the
                supply of land for greenfield suburban residential development,
                which consumers want. That point was made by greenfield
                housebuilders and the Construction Employers Federation. I have
                weighed up those arguments, and I have listened carefully to
                Members’ views.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My view, which is shared by the Assembly
                Committees, is that, as in other parts of the United Kingdom,
                policy can influence the actions and performance of the housing
                market. I am therefore signalling a clear direction of policy
                change towards seeking to achieve substantially more housing in
                our urban areas. That will greatly assist the continuing
                revitalisation of our cities and towns. I stress that, in
                practice, this will be worked out primarily through the
                development plan process, taking into account urban capacity
                studies. I expect the level of brownfield performance to vary
                from town to town, in the light of local characteristics and
                capacity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy sets an ambitious regional
                target to double, over 10 years, the recent level of achievement
                — which was 25% to 30% — for the location of housing growth
                within existing urban areas of cities and towns with a
                population of more than 5,000. Effectively, this sets an
                ambitious regional target of up to 60% to be met before the
                first full review in 2010. That target has been increased from
                the 40% figure recommended by the public examination panel, and
                it reflects a genuine move towards more sustainable patterns of
                development for the region. In setting the target, practice and
                achievement throughout the United Kingdom has been taken into
                consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In regard to the restriction of greenfield
                sites, I am committed to a change in direction that emphasises
                the development of brownfield sites. That does not rule out
                greenfield development but places an emphasis on more housing in
                existing urban areas. Progress towards the regional target will
                be monitored, and after five years an assessment of whether any
                adjustment is necessary will be made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of town cramming was also raised.
                The strategy aims to encourage an increase in the density of
                urban housing, particularly in existing urban areas, which is
                appropriate in scale and design to the cities and towns of
                Northern Ireland. The aim is to encourage higher-density housing
                schemes, through imaginative and innovative design, without town
                cramming. However, the strategy makes it clear that the aim of
                achieving an overall increase in town densities must not be
                interpreted as a broad mandate to impose overdeveloped and
                unsympathetic housing schemes on existing residential areas.
                Redevelopment of existing houses and the development of infill
                sites in such areas need to be handled with sensitivity. The
                overriding objective in such areas must be to avoid any
                significant erosion of the environmental quality, amenities and
                privacy enjoyed by existing residents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice raised the issue of provision for
                children. Her view was that it should be kids, not cars. She
                said that the children of Northern Ireland were not catered for
                in the document. I urge Members to read the document carefully.
                They will see that in every respect we have endeavoured to
                ensure that people from throughout Northern Ireland, regardless
                of age or geographical location, are catered for.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I encourage Members to read the entire
                document. Other Members spoke about the growth of villages and
                towns. The spatial development policy will address that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take on board the issues raised by Members
                from west of the Bann, such as Mrs Carson, who mentioned the
                A29. I am sure that my officials will respond to her query. Mrs
                Courtney spoke about the regional capital of the north-west.
                Londonderry is recognised as such in the document, and she will
                agree that that ought to be the case. Mr Carrick raised some
                issues affecting Craigavon and Banbridge. Members must
                understand that the Belfast metropolitan area is the largest
                conurbation, but that other expanding areas such as Craigavon
                and Banbridge, and areas west of the Bann such as Omagh, and
                areas in Fermanagh, are also recognised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise for not being able to talk about
                the E-way or about Ards Borough, Strabane, Larne and the many
                other areas that were mentioned. I will ensure that my officials
                respond to those individual queries, however long that may take.
                I commend the regional development strategy to the House.</p>
