		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I welcome all Members back after the summer break. Before we proceed, I wish to  say a few words about the future conduct and procedures of the House. I have  already advised the Business Committee that I intend to work with the Deputy  Speakers to maintain a more orderly approach to business.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For example, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development is to make a statement to the House this <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">morning. It is important that Members be in the Chamber</span> at the  start of a ministerial statement. Members who come in immediately after a  ministerial statement has <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">been delivered  will not be called to ask a question on it.</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Another matter caused concern before the recess. The Business Committee spends some time  deliberating on the public and private business of the House.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Timings for business in the House are not set in stone, but  are indicative, and it is really up to Members &mdash; especially party Whips &mdash; to  keep a watching brief <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">on business. On at  least two occasions before the rece</span>ss, I witnessed that Members who had  their names down to move motions were not in the Chamber to do so, because they  were not following the speed of business.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If a Member who has tabled a motion is not in the Chamber  to move that motion, it will automatically fall. Moreover, if Members who are  down either to lead or to speak in debates are not present when it comes to  their turn, we will move on to whoever is next on the list to speak.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we protect the reputation of the House  and the business before it. The past couple of months have been a learning  curve for some Members; however, the period of latitude is now over, and it is  up to every Member to know his or her place in, and the procedures of, the  House.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading">ministerial statement</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="2"></a>Foot-and-Mouth Disease</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We shall move on to the next item of business. I have  received notice from the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development that she  wishes to make a statement on the recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in England.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Today is World Suicide Prevention Day, and, before I make  my statement, I wish to acknowledge those families who have been bereaved by  suicide, which is a huge problem for us.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:14.2pt;">With the Speaker&rsquo;s permission, I  shall make a statement on the recent foot-and-mouth disease outbreak and my  response to it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have a high dependency on external markets, with sales  to destinations outside the North valued at approximately &pound;1&middot;6 billion per  annum, which represents 64% of total agrifood-processing-sector sales. The  outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Britain, therefore, had the  potential to have a significant adverse impact on that trade and on the local  economy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It was vital to stop the disease from entering the North;  however, I found that my main efforts were focused on protecting our trading  status with the rest of Ireland,  and with Britain,  other EU member states and non-EU countries. That entailed getting the EU to  recognise the North&rsquo;s unique position by citing that we are divided from Britain by a  significant body of water, which provides a natural barrier to the spread of animal disease. For disease-control purposes,  therefore, the North is treated as a separate entity from Britain.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am particularly grateful to the First Minister and the  Deputy First Minister for their support: to the First Minister for personally  intervening with the Japanese ambassador in London, after Japan had refused to  accept our product; and to the Deputy First Minister, who held important discussions with the US authorities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I thank my Executive colleagues and the  Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development for their engagement and  support at the time. I wish, too, to pay tribute to our many stakeholders, to  the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and to Invest NI for their  very important and valuable contributions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I thank the staff of the Department of Agriculture  and Rural Development for the sustained commitment and support that they showed  me during that very difficult time. Officials were mobilised here at Stormont,  on farms and at our ports to advise me on policy,  to trace animals and to put in place the necessary biosecurity measures. I recognise and appreciate  the long hours that they put into their work, and the personal impact  that the incident must have had on them and their families, particularly during  a holiday period.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At the beginning of last month, immediately after a case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Sur<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; ">rey</span>, England  on Friday 3 August, I took action to close the North&rsquo;s ports to susceptible species, such as  sheep, pigs, cattle and goats, from Britain. Moreover, I placed an immediate ban on the import from Britain of  fresh meat from susceptible animals and of unpasteurised milk.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Biosecurity measures were introduced at the ports and  airports that were compatible with those in the South, and I recognise  particularly the efforts of the portal staff who mobilised at short notice to  put those measures in place, and who continued to work around the clock. I saw  evidence of their efforts for myself when I visited the ports during the outbreak.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Over that first weekend of the outbreak, my officials  traced and examined all consignments of cattle, sheep, goats and pigs that had  been imported from Britain,  or that had transited Britain  since the beginning of July. In total, 128 consignments were traced and  examined. All examinations were negative, which gave me assurance that no  disease had spread to the North and that no animals had originated from the  infected zones in England.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Based on our own veterinary risk assessment, I decided to  apply no constraints to the operation of abattoirs, shows, markets and assembly  centres here, and that access to the countryside would continue to be  unrestricted. I did ask that the public, and those in rural areas in  particular, introduce appropriate biosecurity measures, and farmers were asked  to be vigilant. In my press releases and in interviews with the press, my  message was that, as far as I was concerned, it was &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo;. I felt  that my actions and those of my officials were swift, decisive and proportionate  to the foot-and-mouth disease threat that we faced.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Thankfully, the situation in Britain is now largely resolved.  There were only two confirmed cases with no spread of disease beyond that, as  demonstrated by the extensive surveillance undertaken. The Chief Veterinary  Officer of the Department for Environment, Food  and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) stated on Friday that foot-and-mouth disease  had been eradicated from Britain.  From noon on Saturday 8 September 2007, DEFRA lifted the surveillance zone in  Surrey, and all restrictions throughout Britain were lifted at the same  time. The Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health (SCoFCAH) will  meet in Brussels tomorrow to decide whether to  revoke all remaining measures that have been applied to Britain during  the past month.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Returning to the issue of trade, exports of animals and  animal products have continued uninterrupted to other member states of the EU.  There have been some minor problems, but, in the bigger scale of things, not  too many, and we have been taking action to rectify those as soon as we are  made aware of them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The safeguard measure brought in by the European Commission  (EC) on 6 August 2007 gave our trade legitimacy in EU law, and this was  confirmed with the revised decision voted through by SCoFCAH on 8 August and  again by an amending EC decision on 23 August. Those decisions have allowed  trade to continue to other member states.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we were able to secure EU recognition of the North as a separate region from Britain, the EU  decision on foot-and-mouth disease still required DARD to provide official certificates to accompany  consignments for EU trade. As industry representatives had concerns that  our certificates could not readily be distinguished from those issued in Britain, some  extra polish was added to make them easily distinguishable. This new format was developed in consultation with the  industry, and with the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. The  EC accepted that revised approach.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The official status of the certificate was emphasised by the  inclusion of the DARD logo. A bold statement was added at the start of the  certificate indicating that we are free from foot-and-mouth disease, and the  exporting country was clearly identified as this region in large, bold print.  Those changes were warmly welcomed by the exporters of meat and dairy products.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As a result of those actions, our agrifood industry has  been able to continue to trade with their customers in Europe.  In meetings with the industry, it has said that there are now relatively few  problems in the EU and that the official certification is working well. I have  also made two pieces of subordinate legislation to enable us to enforce the  terms of the EU decisions if required. My objective has been to maintain  current trade flows to other EU member states by providing adequate assurance  with minimal bureaucracy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At my request, the UK Chief Veterinary Officer wrote  to her counterparts in all EU member states, providing assurance that we are  free from foot-and-mouth disease and that animals and animal products  originating from here pose no risk of foot-and-mouth disease. My officials  followed this up with calls to the offices of the Chief Veterinary Officers of  six key member states &mdash; France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Belgium and the  Netherlands &mdash; to check that the position was understood. Calls to other  countries will be made if specific issues arise.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To assist the dairy industry, the DARD Chief Veterinary  Officer also provided a letter for each of the local exporters of dairy products, which they could pass on to  customers who were nervous about accepting our dairy products. The provision of  those letters was welcomed and has helped  exporters to iron out problems. <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">The  DARD Internet site has also been constantly updated.</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to controls on imports from Britain, we  retained our prohibition on the importation of live animals until 25 August and  on fresh meat produced after 15 July until 24 August.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those imports were  permitted again after a unanimous decision that was taken at SCoFCAH on  23 August to lift &mdash; subject to veterinary certification &mdash; the ban on exporting  live animals and fresh meat from outside the surveillance zone in Surrey to the rest of the EU. In line with that  relaxation on trade to the rest of the EU, we permitted imports to the North  from Britain  to resume under conditions that were similar to those that were applied to  exports to other member states, including the Twenty-six Counties.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The movement of live, susceptible animals from here to Britain has  also been gradually eased over the past few weeks: first, for slaughter  animals; and secondly, for breeding and production animals. As a precaution,  and until the surveillance zone was lifted on 8 September, we continued to  operate additional biosecurity controls at the ports.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have also tried to minimise damage to our trade with  countries that are outside the EU. We have spared no effort to help the beef  and dairy industries in circumstances in which any trading difficulties have  arisen; that work continues. The United States Depart&shy;ment of Agriculture  (USDA) had banned imports of certain animal product from here that were deemed  &ldquo;prohibited&rdquo; &mdash; fresh product that was derived from  foot-and-mouth-disease-susceptible animals &mdash; and that arrived at its ports from  anywhere in the UK on or after 3 August. My officials and I made immediate  contact with the US Administration directly and also through DEFRA and the  European Commission. We put a strong case to the Administration that we should  be treated separately from Britain.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Deputy First Minister and I also raised our  difficulties with senior US  politicians in an attempt to get them to expedite matters. I was therefore  delighted to hear on 17 August from Robert Curtis, the head of the European  division in USDA, that the trading restrictions that had been imposed on  product from the North had been lifted totally with immediate effect. Since  then, five containers of pork products have been exported to the United States.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have also taken steps to address the ban on the  importation of animal product from the UK,  which Japan  announced on 4 August. That decision primarily affected our trade in pork to  the Japanese market. Historically, the Japanese require a high level of  reassurance to restore trade, and, post-2001, that reassurance involved a visit  by a Japanese delegation to the North. Another visit may be required before any  trade is restored this time, but my aim is to help to restore export trade in  animal product to Japan  as early as possible.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">After the helpful phone call that the First Minister made  in the first few days of the outbreak, and at my request, DEFRA has written on our behalf to the Japanese Embassy through the Foreign and Commonwealth  Office (FCO). We are currently awaiting a response to that letter. My  officials will follow up with DEFRA on that and on any issues regarding other  countries.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Similar to the authorities in the USA, those in Canada  have accepted the position of the North on the outbreak of foot-and-mouth  disease in Britain.  They recently approved another meat plant here to export to Canada. We are working with DEFRA in its negotiations  with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) to achieve an early  restoration of the UK&rsquo;s  official foot-and-mouth-disease-free status. Regaining foot-and-mouth-disease-free  status at OIE for the UK is  the quickest route to regaining OIE foot-and-mouth-disease-free status for the  North, given that Britain  contained its outbreak so rapidly. However, the fact that we were recognised at  the outset to be free to trade with the rest of Europe means that some  countries may be persuaded to accept our products before that date, just as the  United States and Canada have done.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have also worked closely with our industry stakeholders  throughout this period. Indeed, in view of the importance of external sales to  the local industry, my permanent secretary and his DETI counterpart have been  in regular contact with dairy and meat processors and exporters and also with  representatives of the retail sector. Those meetings fostered a better  understanding of trading issues for us all. They provided a forum in which  views on necessary action to assist the industry with exports could be heard  and exchanged, and reports on our actions could be brought back. At those  meetings, it was clear that that industry was appreciative of DARD&rsquo;s efforts to  minimise the impact on trade.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have also had regular meetings with our other key  stakeholders, and I am pleased to say that they have supported my decisions and  have congratulated DARD on the actions that have been taken to assist them  during the foot-and-mouth-disease crisis. I emphasise that we gained much from  our meetings with the industry, and I thank those stakeholders for their  positive and constructive engagement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Good communication and liaison with officials and Ministers  in Britain  and the South have been crucial throughout the process.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Consequently, throughout the crisis, I have kept in regular  contact with my ministerial counterparts. I spoke to Mary Coughlan in Dublin and Jonathan Shaw in London on the first evening and had ongoing  and very helpful contact with them in the days that followed. I pay tribute to UK Chief  Veterinary Officer Debby Reynolds and her team for recognising the unique  position of the North in their deliberations, particularly with the European  Commission, and for their outstanding negotiation skills in securing an early  relaxation of the EU restrictions with regard to movement and trade. I would  also like to acknowledge the work of Department of Agriculture and Food officials  in the South in supporting our case.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Together with my officials, I worked on a daily basis with  the South to ensure that the fortress Ireland approach was applied  immediately. That was crucial in ensuring that the North was excluded from the  EU ban on British produce. The support of the South, and our cohesive approach  within the island, was important both operationally with regard to bio-security  and border controls and from an external perspective with regard to trade.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Unsurprisingly, the issue of Brazilian beef imports has  recently been raised again. Questions have been asked in recent weeks as to why  I continue to allow the importation of beef from Brazil. I have responded by  explaining that the Government of the UK,  acting on behalf of England,  Scotland, Wales and the  North, has agreed in the Treaty of Rome that the EU shall act in matters  relating to the common agricultural policy. Consequently, the power to ban meat  from countries with which the EU has established trade agreements is governed  by EU law. The rules governing the importation of fresh meat and meat products  into the North from Brazil  are subject to European Union agreements with Brazil,  which in turn are based on European Commission scrutiny of the controls that Brazil has in  place. Those rules are in the form of Commission decisions and are implemented  here in our national legislation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If we were to act unilaterally to ban imports of Brazilian  beef, it is highly likely that beef importers and exporters would be in a  position to commence legal proceedings against the Department for any loss  suffered as a result. It is also quite possible that the Department would be  open to the levying of EU fines for interfering with the free movement or trade  of a product that has entered Europe legally.  In addition, such an action would constitute a failure to adhere to and  implement the relevant European legislation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I remain concerned about the findings of the Irish  Farmers&rsquo; Association and the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Journal  investigation. I will closely monitor the situation as the Commission  progresses its investigations. I watched last week&rsquo;s developments in Brussels closely,  particularly the declaration put forward by MEPs calling on the Commission to  ban imports of Brazilian beef to the European Union. I also plan to raise the  matter of Brazilian beef imports with my ministerial colleagues at our next  meeting.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the investigations into the source of the  outbreak, we will be giving careful consideration to the reports that DEFRA  published on Friday, and to that Department&rsquo;s response. I am aware that the  reports have concluded that there is no absolute certainty about how the  outbreak occurred. The most likely explanation is a combination of factors,  including weakness in the drainage system, heavy rains, and the movement of  construction vehicles. There are valuable lessons to be learned from these  findings, and we will want to consider what lessons we can draw from the  experience in England  and apply here.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Looking ahead, our focus is on preparation for the next  SCoFCAH meeting, which will take place tomorrow. The indications are that the  Commission will revoke the existing decision and return Britain to its  position prior to 3 August. My priority is to continue to safeguard our ability  to export. I have decided, therefore, to retain all existing certification and  veterinary check procedures until the SCoFCAH decision tomorrow. I obviously do  not want to do anything to undermine the assurance that the present system of  certificates offers to receiving countries and companies. Following SCoFCAH&rsquo;s  decision on 23 August, DEFRA initiated an exercise to identify and prioritise  the markets outside the EU to which UK  companies export, as such countries may be waiting for OIE to restore the UK&rsquo;s foot-and-mouth-disease-free  status. DARD is consulting with the industry to identify such markets for our  exporters, and will liaise with DEFRA on that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have asked my officials to review DARD&rsquo;s response to  identify what went well and any lessons that could be applied in the event of  any future outbreak. Our foot-and-mouth-disease contingency plan, which was  already in place, will be updated and improved in light of what we have learned  from this experience.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I want to pay tribute to our colleagues in Dublin for their support  of, and co-operation with, my Department at such a difficult time. That close  level of North/South co-operation will  continue, given our shared interest  in the prevention of outbreaks of serious animal disease on the island of Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Again, I thank all those who have helped me and my  Department to deal with the recent foot-and-mouth disease crisis. Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call the First Minister, the Rt Hon Dr Paisley.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister (Rev Dr Ian Paisley)</strong>: The Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development knows that we have all been shocked by the plague of suicide of  which she spoke at the beginning of her statement. All of us in this House have  a serious responsibility to help to solve this awful tragedy, which seems to be  growing in our Province.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister agree with me that the help from London, Dublin, the USA and the  Japanese Government in relation to the foot-and-mouth disease incident  was most welcome? I also wish to record the help that I received from the  British ambassador in Dublin  in making contacts for me with people who had power to help us in those  matters. I am sure that all right-thinking people would wish to express thanks  to all those mentioned by the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development,  those who have not been mentioned &mdash; although they, and we, know who they are &mdash;  and, of course, the Minister herself.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his comments. From all of this, we have learned  that the reaction to the incident could not have happened without a local  Minister and Executive in place. The speed with which the Executive met on the  morning of Saturday 4 August, and the ongoing contact that my Department had  with the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and Executive colleagues,  meant that we were able to give leadership and act decisively. Again, I thank  the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister for their most helpful  intervention and support.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call the Deputy First Minister, Mr Martin McGuinness.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister (Mr M McGuinness)</strong>: I concur  with the remarks of the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development  and the First Minister on the issue of suicide.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Develop&shy;ment agree that during the period of the  ban, between 3 August, when it was introduced, and 17 August, when the ban was  lifted, the American authorities moved very speedily, and that that was due in  no small part to the considerable work done by the US ambassador to London, Bob  Tuttle, and his colleague in Dublin, Tom Foley? I made several phone calls to  Paula Dobriansky, who was in Korea  and remained in contact with me, and to Congressmen Richard Neal and Jim Walsh,  who have been long-standing friends of the peace process. I hope that the  Minister will agree that a word of thanks is due to all those whom I have  mentioned.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Again, I thank the Deputy First Minister for his comments. The interaction with  the United States was hugely  significant, and when Canada  followed, it showed that the rest of the world looks to what the United States  does and takes its lead from them. I was amazed at the speed with which USDA  responded. Less than a fortnight after foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in England, USDA  had lifted its restrictions. That was hugely important for our agriculture  industry given the amount of food that we export, especially dairy products. It  was a huge group effort, involving many people in the offices of several Congressmen  and Senators; it would take a full hour to thank everyone who helped and  responded during the crisis. We are very grateful to have the support of such  friends.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural  Development (Dr W McCrea)</strong>:  I thank the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development for its quick and  professional response to the crisis and its efforts to secure derogation from  the EU to allow our exports to continue. I also want to recognise the positive  role played by DEFRA in supporting the arguments for derogation put forward by  the Department. I thank the farming community and the farming unions across the  United Kingdom  for their assistance, and their positive and constructive suggestions during  this crisis.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair" style="margin-top:6.4pt;margin-right:11.35pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:11.35pt;">(Mr Deputy Speaker  [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At the heart of the new certification is the identity of Northern Ireland.  However, I found it interesting that there  was no mention of that in the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Why was &ldquo;the North&rdquo;  mentioned in the statement but not &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo;, when that is  clearly how our produce is identified?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister talked about the &ldquo;fortress Ireland&rdquo;  approach. Is it not important that the identity and independence of Northern Ireland  be protected? If, God forbid, there was an  outbreak in the Irish Republic, Northern Ireland  would have to have independence to be able to trade, as the Irish Republic  did with BSE-free Irish beef at the time of the BSE crisis, when the UK was unable  to trade its beef. Although there is a working relationship with the Irish Republic,  there must be clear identification of and independence for our Northern Ireland  produce.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Can the Minister tell the House what lessons the Department  has learned from the crisis and how those lessons can be applied in Northern Ireland?  What risks are there, and is the Department undertaking a review of biosecurity  at our own laboratories?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although it is true that we cannot act independently, it is  of vital importance that the Minister actively participate in the debate so as  to stop Brazilian beef. We must force the hand not only of DEFRA and the  Ministers in the rest of the United Kingdom,  but of Europe, to protect our product, because  it is the best product and it should be able to stand on its own feet across  the world.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  A LeasCheann Comhairle, I will answer the Chairman of the Agriculture and Rural  Development Committee&rsquo;s questions in reverse order. As a member of the European  Union, the North is bound by EU law to accept products from countries outside the  EU. Therefore, we cannot impose a ban on  all Brazilian beef, but we can ban &mdash; and have banned &mdash; imports of beef  from areas of Brazil that are affected by foot-and-mouth disease.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department has robust controls in place to ensure that  imports from countries outside the EU meet the required standards and will  seize products that do not adhere to those standards. The European Commission plans a Food and Veterinary Office mission  to Brazil later this year as  a follow-up to an earlier visit and has said that, unless the situation  improves and the Brazilian Government can give assurances on the quality of  beef exported to Europe, it will reconsider controls on beef imports to Europe  from Brazil.  As I said earlier, I will be working with my ministerial colleagues and I will  push for action on Brazilian beef similar to that which has been taken in other  places.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Our Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) laboratories  do not hold stocks of the foot-and-mouth virus. Most of their work is done  around bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis, and there have never been any leaks  or any biosecurity mishaps or accidents at those  laboratories. I spoke to Se&aacute;n Hogan, the chairman of AFBI, and George  McIlroy, the chief executive, on the  evening of 3 August and asked those same questions. I am content that we  do not have the same risk, as we do not have the live virus in the laboratories  here. The public can be reassured by that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department has learned lessons from this. It will  update and review its foot-and-mouth disease contingency plan. It was good for  the Department to be challenged in this way to see how quickly it could respond  and put provisions in place. I have spoken to people who came over on the boat  that evening and who were impressed to see that biosecurity measures had  immediately been put in place at the ports. They did not even realise that  there had been a foot-and-mouth outbreak in England until they came home and  saw the portal staff. Measures such as that help to reassure people that the  Department is doing all that it can to keep disease out of Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand where the Chairman of the Agriculture  Committee is coming from in regard of the Twenty-six Counties. However, I felt  sorry for Richard Lochhead, the agriculture Minister in Scotland. He  was faced with many challenges, because the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease  was on the island   of Britain. Scotland faced automatic restrictions even  though the outbreak was geographically closer to France.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If there were an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease  anywhere in the Twenty-six Counties, the whole island of Ireland  would suffer, regardless of what was done in the North. The disease is virulent  because it so easily transmitted: it can be airborne, transmitted from the  wheels of cars and lorries or carried on people&rsquo;s feet. It is a serious illness  when it gets into a herd.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I am content with the amount of work that was done  with ministerial colleagues such as Mary Coughlan in the South. A stringent  policy on animal health and welfare is needed, and that has been on the table for many years. Diseases do not recognise  borders, and I am deeply concerned about other diseases in <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">mainland Europe,  such as avian influenza and blueton</span>gue. Robust measures must be taken at  our ports to try to keep all diseases out of Ireland. Action must be taken on an  all-island capacity to eradicate them. I do not want any disease to come from Dublin and affect trade  in the Six Counties. It makes sense to treat the island as an epidemiological  unit.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Lessons have been learnt. It has been a challenging time  for the Department and for me. Thankfully, with the support of colleagues &mdash; and  I have acknowledged the support that the Committee for Agriculture and Rural  Development has shown me &mdash; our reaction to the outbreak was well handled. We  should not be complacent, but we know that we did all in our power to keep Ireland free  from foot-and-mouth disease. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I commend the Minister and the Department on their  handling of the outbreak. Will the Minister detail her plans to ensure that biosecurity is as effective as possible in  guaranteeing freedom from future outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease,  and other diseases?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I will continue to ensure that everything possible be done  to keep us free of animal diseases that  would have serious economic implications. My Department has put in place  a system at the ports to ensure that dirty  vehicles are not permitted to enter the North. Robust systems ensure  that no contaminated soil can enter the North on vehicles from other places.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Additional systems, such as the disinfection seen at ports in the past month, can easily be introduced  at times of increased risk, and can be stepped up depending on the level of threat. Our procedures for cattle  traceability are excellent and form  the basis for ensuring that animals are closely monitored and can be  easily traced. For example, during the outbreak, my Department traced within 48  hours all 128 consignments of animals that had come from Britain since  the start of July. That was fundamental to ensuring that, if the disease had  spread, the Department would have picked up on it quickly and dealt with it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department has a long-term commitment to education,  including the timely implementation of biosecurity measures in response to  heightened risk. Education takes the form of leaflets, advertising and posters.  Since becoming Minister, I have been invited to disinfect my feet on every farm  that I have visited. Biosecurity measures are already in place on farms.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is close co-operation between my Department and the  Department of Agriculture and Food in the South on the prevention, surveillance  and control of a range of epizootic  diseases, some of which I mentioned earlier. That co-operation has  included discussions on the assessment of risk; the preventive actions that  would be taken in respective jurisdictions, and the importance of those actions  being co-ordinated; the alignment of contingency planning; and the control of  movement that would be necessary in the event of an outbreak. Given the shared  interest in preventing the introduction of serious animal disease to the island of Ireland, that close co-operation between  North and South will continue.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I wish to thank the Minister and the departmental officials for the swiftness  with which they dealt with difficulties arising from the outbreak of  foot-and-mouth disease in England.  We did not wish to create any unnecessary alarm among the general public of Northern    Ireland, and that was successfully achieved.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Identifying and examining all the relevant animals that had  come from GB into Northern    Ireland since the beginning of July was a  huge task, and I am thankful that the  disease did not spread beyond the original zone. My aim is to ensure  that the general public and farmers with produce from Northern Ireland  are protected.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the report on the source of the disease, and  with the particular reference to Pirbright, there does not appear to be  sufficient clarification on the situation  there. Part of the site comprises a Government laboratory, and if the  source of the disease had been directly from  a farmer, there would have been completely different consequences for  the farming community. I am very concerned that there may be a cover-up by the  Government about the source of the disease.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister  support a Northern Ireland  branding and labelling strategy for its meat products, and would that be helpful? Also, regarding the  export of our products during the crisis, what actual difference was there  between regulations and licensing governing the export of non-fresh food from Northern Ireland  and those for non-fresh, or non-live, exports from the rest of GB outside the  surveillance zone?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I will try to address all of those questions. As regards concerns about  Pirbright, the privately-owned laboratory, which is run by Merial, ceased  operating from the point at which the outbreak was confirmed, and Merial will  be unable to restart its operations until all remedial work has been completed.  On the Government side, the Institute for  Animal Health has also decreased its workload and is only conducting  necessary work in an attempt to ensure that all bioremedial action is  implemented to ensure safety. There is still an issue around the sanitation of  effluent prior to it leaving the plant.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are concerns and lessons to be learned, and officials are examining the matter in detail to  determine what steps we need to take. We wish to have robust systems in  place that will ensure that this can never happen again.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In answer to the question regarding non-fresh products, I  do not have the relevant details and will respond later in writing. As regards  labelling, I have been talking to people in the industry and have had some  enlightening conversations with them since taking up my post, and not just  since 3 August when the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak was confirmed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the people I have spoken to have said that the  marketing strategy is important and that we must get it right. I can quote  those who have told me in no uncertain terms that labelling produce &ldquo;Northern  Ireland&rdquo; for export purposes does not work &mdash; and those are people who are successfully  exporting to the United States on an all-island basis. They are telling me &mdash;  and I am not making a political comment &mdash; that Irish branding works much better  when exporting to the United States, and that they will stick with that. My Department will work very closely with the industry  to see what works best. We wish to maximise  the returns, especially in exporting. Sixty-four percent of our produce  is exported.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is no small feat. We will consider carefully what we  need to do. I intend to carry out more work on labelling and on marketing our  food. I will do what is best for the industry and what gets the best returns  elsewhere for our fresh, quality products.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  First, I compliment those who installed the  new audio system. We do not have to lip-read in this corner any more,  because we can now hear.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for her statement and for her answers  to the questions that have been posed. The Minister and her Department were  rightly praised for the prompt action taken at the time. I also pay tribute to  those who so quickly traced the consignment of imported animals. That  traceability worked on that occasion gave great confidence to those who, at  times, may have been critical of traceability and of the detail that often goes  into it. I cannot name each person involved, but I wish to thank everyone  North, South, east and west who helped during the crisis.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, was it an oversight not to include immed&shy;iately a  ban on the importation of non-pasteurised milk and fresh meat? Why was there a  24-hour delay in doing so? In a foot-and-mouth disease crisis, 24 hours can be  critical.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  When I received the telephone call on the evening of Friday 3 August, my  instinctive reaction was to close the ports and ban live animals from being  imported. We had all learnt lessons from the 2001 outbreak, when we saw the  implications of foot-and-mouth disease after it entered the country. I spoke to  Jonathan Shaw from DEFRA and to Mary Coughlan in Dublin. I agreed with Mary Coughlan that we  would adopt a similar approach. It was Saturday morning before Dublin officials told us that they were  taking the step of banning the import of unpasteurised milk and fresh meat. We  had said that we would work in tandem with the Department of Agriculture and  Food, so we then introduced the same ban. I was not advised on the Friday night  that it was necessary to take that step, considering the threat that existed at  that time. However, as I have said, we had agreed to take a similar approach,  North and South. That is why there was a time lapse in the introduction of that  ban. Again, that is something that we would put in our &ldquo;lessons learned&rdquo; paper  and in the foot-and-mouth disease contingency plan. Every time that we go  through a similar crisis, we learn lessons. It does not bode well for the  future if we do not learn anything. I might not have gone down the route of  banning the import of unpasteurised milk and fresh meat, but I am now glad that  I did. With the benefit of hindsight, it was the right thing to do. That is why  one decision was taken on Friday night and the other on Saturday morning.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We also tried to identify whether any products that arrived on boats on Friday evening would be susceptible,  but there were none. I could have turned boats around that Friday had there  been live animals on board, and we did that later in the weekend. Obviously, it  was a fluid situation, but on Saturday and Sunday we did send shipments of  fresh meat and unpasteurised milk products back to England.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I,  too, thank the Minister, her ministerial colleagues  and, particularly, DARD staff for the efficient, constructive and  collective way in which they dealt with the problem. Perhaps lessons can be  learned for other issues that will face the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">By Monday 6 August, the Minister reported to a group of  MLAs that 128 consignments of animals had already been traced and examined.  That is a tribute to the work that staff in Dundonald House and in the local divisional veterinary offices carried out.  However, when the Minister refers to the review that her officials are  carrying out, what external advice and assistance is being made available to  that review? Real issues may be understood by having an external opinion on  such a review. That is not a criticism of  the officials concerned but merely a statement that those who were so  closely involved may not appreciate all the lessons that must be learned,  especially as we face not only foot-and-mouth disease in future but other  diseases such as bluetongue and avian flu.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. There will be a review of  how we dealt with the issue, and part of the strength was in the collective  approach that was adopted. On the Monday after the outbreak, the Department met  industry representatives from between 50 and 60 different organisations and  bodies with an interest in the issue. That invitation was extended to Belfast  Zoo, the Tourist Board, all the agristakeholders, the Committee members, et  cetera. The Department worked very closely throughout with the entire industry,  and took its advice and guidance as and when necessary.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department will want to discuss an external review, and  I shall examine the possibility. The Department worked closely with the  industry during the latest outbreak, and work was done on a collective basis.  That enabled us to make decisions that suited the industry and kept key exports  and trade going so that there was no significant downturn in business.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  record my thanks to the Department and the Minister for the swift action taken  during the latest foot-and-mouth crisis to secure Northern Ireland&rsquo;s position as a  foot-and-mouth-free zone.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister accept that the poultry and pig sectors  in Northern Ireland  currently face a major financial crisis? If the price of the produce is not  immediately increased to a level that reflects the massively increased feed  costs, many producers in those sectors face financial ruin.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question and for the very creative use of his time.  As the Member knows, we are supposed to be dealing with foot-and-mouth disease.  Obviously, I am exercised by the demands and challenges for the poultry and pig  sectors at the moment, so he may get an opportunity to ask that question again later on in ministerial questions.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I join other Members in commending  the Minister, the Department and all those who worked to prevent the spread of  the latest outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease from England. Their speedy approach  incorporated the lessons from the last outbreak, and put them into practice to  maintain our biosecurity and the stability of the farming industry, and that  has been commended by all.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I refer to the &ldquo;fortress Ireland&rdquo; approach that was adopted  during the latest outbreak, and how important that was in ensuring that the  scare did not last long. Members know that foot-and-mouth disease can be a very  lengthy business for farmers, and we have learned lessons from the previous  outbreak. People should take into account that because this is an island, we  are entitled to adopt that type of approach. I am sure that the Minister will agree that the shamrock brand has been of  enormous benefit to the island  of Ireland for produce, and the fact  that we were considered separate from England,  Scotland and Wales made an  enormous difference, particularly in monetary terms, to our farmers. I am sure  the Minister will agree that the island approach will always be of vital  importance in dealing with any future outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease. Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I congratulate the Member for  asking a question that lasted longer than the answer will last. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The &ldquo;fortress Ireland&rdquo;  approach was crucial in minimising the risk to the island of Ireland  during the foot-and-mouth outbreak. My officials and I worked very closely with  our counterparts in Dublin  to ensure that a consistent approach, which was proportionate to the risk, was  adopted throughout the island. The Department already has close links with its  counterpart in Dublin,  and that close level of North/South co-operation will continue in future. The  European Commission recognised the unique position of the North, which meant  that we were excluded from the EU ban and therefore allowed to continue to  trade with other member states.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On the Saturday morning after the foot-and-mouth disease  outbreak in England,  the First Minister spoke of our need to retain trade with the rest of the  island. He mentioned the large quantity of our business that is done on an  island-wide basis and the movement of animals to markets and shows. Those  comments were important. That the border did not close during the recent  outbreak was very important; that we did not implement the same level of  spraying and disinfecting that was carried out along the border in 2001 was  also important. That was helpful to the industry.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate Mr McHugh&rsquo;s  comments on the marketing of our  produce, and, as I said to Mr Elliott earlier, I will be examining how best to market and label our produce  to secure the maximum return for our producers.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her response and for the good work of her Department,  which is much appreciated. One of the pitfalls during the recent outbreak of  foot-and-mouth disease was the movement of farm machinery from the location of  the outbreak in England to Northern Ireland.  In light of the breakdown of the rules during the recent outbreak of  foot-and-mouth disease, what action has the Minister and her Department taken to ensure that any movement of  farm machinery from the Republic  of Ireland to Northern Ireland or machinery that has been  brought here on the ferry from the UK mainland will be monitored?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My second question &mdash; which the Minister might have already  answered, and I apologise if she has &mdash; is on what lessons might be learned from  the outbreak across the water, which, it seems, arose at a DEFRA laboratory.  What lessons can the Department learn from that incident for its own benefit?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I am glad that the Member asked about the transport of farm machinery, because  there are always robust measures in place at our ports &mdash; not only during foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks.  Vehicles are routinely checked, and every vehicle that leaves a ferry at one of our ports is examined. If there is  evidence of soil, clay, straw, hay or any similar material on a vehicle,  it is deemed to be unfit for entry, and it is sent back. Our port staff have carried out those examinations, and  they will continue to do so. They have no comp&shy;unction about sending back a  machine that is dirty, because it is not safe to bring it here.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A journalist asked me the same question as Mr Shannon, and  I said the same thing to the journalist that  I will say to Mr Shannon. If he has any information about the transport  of tainted farm machinery, I would be interested to hear it, because the  Department wants to see an absolute crackdown. Considering the reassur&shy;ance  that I have received from the Department on the stringent measures that are in  place, I would be highly surprised if a soiled vehicle were permitted through  our ports. If a vehicle is not allowed entry owing to its condition, it is  transported back at the exporter&rsquo;s expense. There is, therefore, a financial  inducement to ensure that vehicles are clean enough to be brought here and to  be permitted to remain.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Agriculture and Rural Develop&shy;ment and I  will look carefully at what happened in England and at DEFRA&rsquo;s response and will be examining  what we need to do. There will be implications for all of us from the lessons  of the outbreak, and they will be given careful consideration.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A contingency plan is  being prepared. First, it will be brought  to the permanent secretary and the departmental board, and then it will  come to me. I will immediately share that plan with the Committee for  Agriculture and Rural Development. There  will be a joined-up approach. Officials worked well throughout the  recent crisis, and we have begun examination of DEFRA&rsquo;s paper to see what  lessons can be learned and what measures we can put in place to strengthen our  foot-and-mouth contin&shy;gency plan for the future.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  will keep my remarks brief. As a member of the Agriculture Committee, I  compliment the Minister on a job well done and I thank her for doing everything  within her power to protect the agriculture industry in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As a farmer, I am only too aware of what could have  happened this summer. We all remember the disaster of 2001, and I wish to  acknowledge and commend the Minister for her swift intervention.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Indeed, it appears that lessons have been learnt  from the past. I thank the Minister for keeping members of the Committee for  Agriculture and Rural Development informed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It would be remiss of me not to mention &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr Savage, I must ask you to come to your question.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: It would be remiss of me not to mention DARD&rsquo;s permanent  secretary, Dr Malcolm McKibbin, who played a pivotal role.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Minister for her comments about Brazilian  beef. However, will she consider using the Northern Ireland Centre in Europe to  encourage the European Parliament to debate the issue of Brazilian beef with a  view to banning it or bringing it up to the traceability standards that we have  in Great Britain and Northern Ireland?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Member for his  question and his comments. I come from a farming background, and I fully  appreciate what he is saying.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is all too clear that this disease is rampant. The  Member represents Upper Bann, which was the  worst-affected constituency in the previous outbreak. The Department will do  all it can to keep out this awful disease.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the Member mentioned Dr McKibbin. I  appreciated his valuable support and help in the crisis. He was not found  wanting when it came to making difficult  decisions and supporting me in carrying them out.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will discuss the Brazilian beef issue with our MEPs and  will use Eileen Kelly in the Brussels  bureau, and whatever avenues are available, to try to sort out that problem. Brazilian beef is an emotive issue  because of the problems that Brazil has with foot-and-mouth  disease and the fact that our farmers are aggrieved that the standards to which  they have to produce their livestock are not necessarily mirrored in other  parts of the world. Beef, or any product, that is imported should be produced  to the same rigorous standards under which our farmers work. We produce one of  the best-quality products in the world because, from birth to factory, we take  very good care of our animals. Our animal  welfare is second to none, and the same standards should also apply in  areas that export to us.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister has outlined the  diplomatic efforts that were made to ensure that our exports were not blocked  by the international community. Does the Minister agree that those same  contacts can now be used to enhance and improve our exports overseas?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. As I have already mentioned, while the First Minister was  contacting the Japanese ambassador in London,  the Deputy First Minister was making phone calls to the US Administration. At  my request, the Department&rsquo;s Chief Veterinary Officer wrote to other European  Chief Veterinary Officers, advising them that we were free from foot-and-mouth  disease. In places such as Turkey,  there were difficulties concerning hides and skins; that work is ongoing. The  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and Invest NI were involved in  other strategies such as &ldquo;meet the buyer&rdquo;  events, and letters of comfort were  given to exporters who were experiencing difficulties.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Member&rsquo;s question is valid. We want to raise  everyone&rsquo;s boat and want producers to get a better return for their product.  Markets are opening up &mdash; for example, in China and India &mdash; that have potential  and have not been tapped into to any extent.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the Committee for Agriculture and Rural  Development, and the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, in trying to  expand our markets by looking at other regions and countries into which our  products can be exported. We have a high-quality product, and we should be  getting a good price for it. We should examine areas into which we have not  traditionally exported beef, for example, in order to get the best return for  that product. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  In the Minister&rsquo;s statement to the House, she said that export sales are valued  at &pound;1&middot;6 billion and that that represents some 64% of the total sales of the  agrifood processing sector.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is a phenomenal figure by anyone&rsquo;s standards. Can the  Minister tell Members what the financial impact has been on the agrifood  industry as a result of the measures that she was forced to take to ensure that  foot-and-mouth disease did not spread to Northern Ireland?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I cannot give a specific figure, but I will reply to the Member in writing.  However, the financial impact was minimal in comparison with what it might have  been. Given the fact that we were able to carry on trading with the rest of  Europe and, in a very short time, with the United States and other countries,  we did our best to minimise damage to the industry.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The North is an exporting country, and it could never  consume all that it produces. The industry relies on export markets, which are important to our economy. We keep  hearing about the importance of export trade and of being able to export  products from here. It was important to keep that export trade open, and I am  pleased that we were able to do that as it is important to the industry. People  will accept the fact that the initial difficulties were ironed out. In the week  after 3 August 2007, representatives from the dairy industry met departmental  officials every day, and that industry worked closely with those officials to  iron out any problems. I spoke to Hugh  McReynolds from Grampian Country Pork Ltd about the Japanese issues, and  the First Minister was also involved in those discussions. The damage was  minimised. However, I will write to the Member with figures, but I imagine that  they will be quite low.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: As there are no further questions for the Minister, we will move  on to the next item of business.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Standing Order 18(1) states:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;A Member of the Executive Committee shall make  statements to the Assembly on matters for which the Executive Committee is  responsible.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One must, therefore,  logically presume that members of the Executive Committee act  collectively on behalf of that Committee, as, for example, when Mr Murphy  addressed the House about the flooding in east Belfast. This morning, the Speaker allowed  two members of the Executive Committee &mdash; the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister &mdash; to ask questions of the  Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development on a statement made &mdash;  presumably &mdash; on behalf of them as members of the Executive. Can you explain  this constitutional novelty to the House, or can you pass on a message to the Speaker to allow him to do so at an  appropriate time?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The First Minister is also the leader of his party and can raise a  point in that capacity, which he did this morning.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We will move on to &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Speaker called Dr Paisley as the First Minister and Mr McGuinness as the  Deputy First Minister. The subsequent round of questions started &mdash; quite  properly &mdash; with Dr McCrea as Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and  Rural Development and Mr Boylan representing the second-largest party in the  Assembly. Dr Paisley and Mr McGuinness were given not only an additional status  but recognition as Ministers. Therefore, I repeat my request that you discuss  the matter with the Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I take your further point of order, Mr Ford. I was not in the  Chair at that time. I will refer the matter to the Speaker, and the Speaker  will respond appropriately.</p>

		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The next item on the Order Paper is a motion to change the membership  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment. As with other similar motions, it will be treated as a  business motion. Therefore, there will be no debate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That Mr Francis Molloy replace Mr Mitchel McLaughlin as a  member of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment. &mdash; <em>[Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n.]</em></p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading">private members&rsquo; business</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="4"></a>Economic Development Task Force</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for this debate. The proposer of the  motion will have 10 minutes to  propose and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members  will have five minutes to speak. One amendment has been selected and published  on the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes to  propose and five minutes to make a winding-up speech.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Enterprise, Trade  and Investment to establish a task force to address urgently the economic  development of the west, including the areas covered by Fermanagh, Omagh,  Strabane, Dungannon and Cookstown District Councils; and further calls upon the  Minister to bring forward a report of the task force by 31st March 2008, to  include specific recommendations to tackle neglect, increase investment and maximise opportunities for North-South funding  aimed at improving infrastructure and achieving higher levels of  employment and employability in these areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion addresses the imbalances that exist between the east and the west in infrastructure,  economic development and job opportunities. People everywhere expect  that we in Northern Ireland  are on a road to a new beginning. The  principles of inclusion and equality are embedded in Government policy,  and the motion is about making that policy a reality.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is time for the west to have a new start. I will not use  the debate to list endless complaints about past neglect in the area, nor will  I propose that resources should be diverted from deprived areas elsewhere in Northern Ireland.  I will make the case to increase equality of opportunity and to redress the  historic underfunding of the west. The  appointment of members to the task force is the responsibility of the  Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, as is the task of overseeing the implementation of  proposals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the west&rsquo;s not being on a level playing field,  there is enormous potential in the area. We have a highly skilled workforce,  and our young people are well educated. There are successful companies, some of  which are household names in Northern    Ireland and beyond, and we have excellent  natural resources and assets that attract thousands of visitors every year. The  Erne-Shannon link is an example of the benefits that can be gained for border  areas through the development of North/South links.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, Members must recognise that the west suffers  as a result of the legacy of neglect and that there are serious disadvantages  and past wrongs that we have a responsibility to put right. No railways serve  the west; they were all closed down 40 years ago. There is no gas supply, with  the result that businesses have to depend entirely on electricity. Access to  broadband is limited, and the telecommunications network that serves the area  is second rate. When it was being built more than 40 years ago, the motorway  that was supposed to replace the railways stopped at Dungannon. There was a  promise that it would be extended to Enniskillen. However, it has never been  extended. That failure to put in place an important road link started a trend  that continues. As a result of a lack of investment in new roads, Enniskillen  suffers chronic and serious traffic congestion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Plans for bypasses &mdash; such as the southern bypass and the  Cherrymount link, which are necessary to divert through-traffic away from the  town centre &mdash; have been with the roads authorities for more than 20 years.  There is still no sign of work starting. The recently completed Omagh bypass  was fought for for over 30 years. The failure of Government to provide funding  for roads is an ongoing source of frustration and annoyance in Fermanagh and  Tyrone. Members must not forget that public transport is poor and that most  people have no choice but to rely on their cars.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Unemployment statistics that cover many years have  documented the lack of both investment and job opportunities in the west. In  March 2007 the Labour Market Bulletin from the Department of Enterprise, Trade  and Investment stated that districts in the west of Northern Ireland showed the highest  concentration of long-term claimants, with the eastern region showing to be  lower.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Without investment and  infrastructure, local services are  being squeezed, and the people of Strabane, Omagh, Enniskillen and  Dungannon know that too well. Even now, every proposed reform, be it the Water  Service or in relation to the Review of  Public Administration (RPA), is about centralisation. With such  centralisation, the east will gain and the west will lose.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland  Tourist Board (NITB) produced a strategy for growth in 2007, which was  based on the development of what it called signature projects. Those are meant  to act as magnets to pull in tourists, help the economy and create jobs.  However NITB excluded Fermanagh and Tyrone from the list.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are only some examples of the very unfair policies  being implemented by Government and that serve the west very badly. It is time  to put an end to that and begin to remove the historical disadvantage that pertains  to the west.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To begin that turnaround, I call for the establishment of a  task force. However, it will be a task force with a difference &mdash; its  recommendations will be acted upon and will be grounded in reality. It is time  for a task force to examine in detail the measures that are required to level  the playing field.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Each of the five councils in the west, together with partners in the business and community sectors,  has been striving to increase investment and tackle difficulties such as  factory closures and job losses in the textile industry. The five councils  agreed and launched a western economic strategy in 2006 to encourage enterprise  and to lobby for, among other things, better roads. An Assembly-appointed task  force will give focus and better cohesion to that work.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are some absolute priorities, such as roads, the  decentralisation of Civil Service jobs, inward investment and healthcare, which  are all high on the agenda of the people of the west.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We need a major transport plan that will take forward  speedily the expansion of the two corridors already identified in the  development plans of the Northern and Southern Governments. Those are the  North/west corridor, linking Derry to Dublin  through Omagh, Strabane and Monaghan, and the east/west corridor linking Sligo  to Belfast  through Enniskillen and Dungannon. We know that the Irish Government has  pledged &pound;700 million for such projects, which are in the interest of regional,  balanced development, and which will draw down European Union support.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make it clear that I am calling for a  time-limited task force, as stated in the motion, to bring forward  recommendations. It is a reasoned and specific call for action. The amendment,  on the other hand, calls for no specific action that would be directed  immediately towards solving our obvious problems, which will be highlighted by  other Members today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am calling for a task force, because any serious attempts  to develop the west will require the active participation of many bodies,  including Departments. It is simply not good enough for the development needs  of the west to be taken into account through a general motion. The west needs  more than discussions. Due to many years of neglect, neither I nor anyone in  the west believe that we will get anywhere by taking things into account.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The west cannot continue to be the last item on the agenda  of this or any other Assembly. It must not be allowed  to slip between the cracks. We need a task force that sets out clearly  for the Assembly&rsquo;s consideration what needs to be done, how much it will cost  and how it will be done.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As we know, the whole island suffers from regional  imbalance. Through North/South co-operation, we have the means to take steps to  tackle that, develop new plans and spread benefits to the west.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no mention of such co-operation in the amendment.  This is not simply about the development of two economic corridors. The rural  population in the area is dispersed, and many of its roads are third class.  Roads Service must step up and make a substantial investment in the repair of  those roads.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The main factors for business are access to markets and  labour. It would be a great pity if, on a motion asking simply for equality of  opportunity and fair play, there was a reversion to the sterile politics of the  past, with unionist Members combining to defeat a proposal for specific  recommendations. I hope that that will not happen.  Some people would be surprised if it happened; most would not, and they  would not be impressed if it came to pass. I say to the Assembly that if it  does, this matter will come back here. Now is the time for a new start in the  west.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I beg to move the following amend&shy;ment: Leave out all after the first &ldquo;to&rdquo; and  insert</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;investigate with relevant Ministers the economic development  of the west, including the areas covered by Fermanagh, Omagh, Strabane,  Cookstown, and Dungannon District Councils; and to ensure that these matters,  including infrastructure, employment and employability, are taken into account  in the discussions leading to the Programme for Government, Budget and  Comprehensive Spending Review.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gallagher used a significant phrase: he said that &ldquo;the  sterile politics of the past&rdquo; would be insufficient. Had he taken that  sentiment on board before he drafted his  motion, we might have had consensus on something. However, I hope that,  as a result of the amendment and the debate, we will be able to achieve that,  because both of us are saying the same thing in different ways. Mr Gallagher is as keen as I am to see the west  develop. I look forward to Mr Gallagher&rsquo;s withdrawing his motion and throwing his weight behind the amendment.  That would send a powerful message to the Assembly, which he asks to move away  from the sterile politics of the past, to Northern Ireland and further  afield.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate the authors of the Western Economic Strategy  Team&rsquo;s &lsquo;Strategy and Action Plan 2006-2008&rsquo;. It is a concise and significant  document that will be relied upon greatly in the future as we seek to improve  the economy of the west. The plan aims to promote greater co-ordination and  cohesion among economic support agencies in the western areas and to position  that region as a place in which to do business.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For too long there has been a definite line between east  and west in Northern Ireland.  As I have said previously, with respect to economic development it is almost as  though there are two Northern Irelands. If we  are to bring the west onto a par with the rest of Northern Ireland, there must be a  change in mindset.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Western Economic Strategy Team has laid out structured  suggestions for economic development that would greatly enhance the lives of  residents and constituents in the area. I recommend that all Members read that  document. The strategy embraces the district council areas of Dungannon and  South Tyrone, Fermanagh, Cookstown, Omagh and Strabane. The various Government  agencies and Departments are left in no doubt as to what is necessary for  proper consider&shy;ation of those areas&rsquo; needs  and feelings. We do not want to be thrown leftovers from other projects,  but rather to be integrated into every strategy, including those for  employment, development, tourism and education.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Undoubtedly, the west now fares better than it has done  previously. The upgrading of the A4 between Dungannon and the Ballygawley  roundabout, due to commence next spring, will add significantly to the road  infrastructure of the Province and of the west. There is still a lot more to be  done. The continued upgrading of County   Fermanagh&rsquo;s roads is  important and must be examined sooner rather than later. A distributor road is  necessary in Dungannon to deal with congestion in the town centre and to carry  that traffic which does not seek to come to Dungannon but to go elsewhere.  There has to be a distributor road to take away the traffic that is causing  congestion but bringing very little else to Dungannon.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The west is blessed  with exciting tourism opportunities, but funding to promote them to full  capacity is often lacking. Similarly, residents of the west face difficulty in  accessing employment, and that is coupled with continuous economic strain in  rural communities. The scales of funding must be fairly balanced to ensure that  the area flourishes and becomes steadily stronger, instead of being allowed to stagnate. It is vital that every  possible avenue to highlight the need for immediate and dramatic change is  explored, and that the aim of improving our respective areas is fully  supported. On examination, the current picture can sometimes seem grim. A positive change is overdue and will be  welcomed. The sooner that happens, the better.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The total population in the west is some 224,000, which  represents around 13% or 14% of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s population. By 2017, if trends  continue, that figure will increase by around 10%. I doubt that other areas are  growing at that rate. The west also has an above-average number of  under-16-year-olds in employment with no formal qualifications, particularly in  the Strabane District Council area. Such issues need to be tackled head on.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A total of 12,800 enterprises are located in the western  region, of which a staggering 99% are small businesses employing less than 50  people. There are a mere five large enterprises employing more than 250 people,  and all of those are located in or around the Dungannon and South Tyrone  Borough Council area. I ask the Minister of Enterprise Trade and Investment to look at  those figures, which are significant and worthy of consideration.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Gaping differences are noted in the Strabane and Cookstown  areas, which respectively boast just 10 and 15 companies that employ more than  50 people. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment must give  consideration to that fact when job creation is promoted in Northern Ireland  in order to ensure that the west will not be forgotten, but will be given its  proper place among the other regions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There have been areas of significant growth in both the  manufacturing and construction sectors. However, there is ongoing below-average employment in education across the region, perhaps with the exception of  Omagh, and below-average employment in the public administ&shy;ration  sector. I agree with Mr Gallagher&rsquo;s comments on that important point.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The average weekly earnings across the region are below the  Northern Ireland  average, with employees in Cookstown the worst affected. In 2004-05, 16% of  redundancies in Northern    Ireland were in the west &mdash; a jump of 7% on  the previous year. That translates as 782 job losses in two years, of which 60%  were in Strabane. Those are significant figures and I am delighted to see the  Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment in the Chamber. The Minister will be responding to the  debate, and I know that he will take seriously Members&rsquo; concerns that something  must be done. I look forward to the future and his heading up of the  Department, because it is true to say that his roots are in the west too, so he  has an interest in the area not falling behind, and I have no doubt that he  will not allow that to happen.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Statistics show that the combined local government  districts of the west fall within the 40% most deprived in Northern Ireland.  Shockingly, Strabane ranks as not only the most deprived area in the subregion,  but in Northern Ireland as a whole. That is extremely worrying  given that the definition of the word &ldquo;deprivation&rdquo; includes housing, general  facilities, fuel, and environ&shy;mental, educational, working and social  conditions. Therefore, it can be argued that the affected areas, particularly  Strabane, lack all of those elements, which are nothing more than basic  requirements that should be expected in today&rsquo;s society. The day-to-day living  that most of us take for granted has been denied to most of those who are  affected by that situation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although Strabane has earned the unpleasant reputation as  the most deprived district in the Province, its  neighbours do not fall far behind. Omagh, Cookstown and Dungannon have  been designated among the six most disadvantaged council areas in Northern Ireland  &mdash; a fact of which the Department must take  cognisance, and to which it must give proper consideration.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Strabane, Dungannon and Omagh are well below the Northern Ireland  average for economic activity. Why should that be? The number of people who  claim unemployment benefit in western areas is higher than the Northern Ireland  average. That is not acceptable. There must be the same opportunities for all.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The west must not be an afterthought: the place that is  thought about only when there are leftovers to be given out. I do not subscribe  to that at all. I trust that the House and the Department do not either. That  is why I have moved an amendment that focuses directly on the issues and will  take politics out of the equation altogether. Members are not here to play  politics with such matters. There will be plenty of opportunity to do that with  less important issues. In my estimation, to do that in the current situation  would be unforgivable. I strongly commend the amendment to the House. I ask the  House to unite behind it and send out a powerful message that, in future, the  west must be treated like the rest and also that it demands the best.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  congratulate Mr Gallagher for moving this important motion, which seeks to deal  with the infrastructural neglect of the west over the past years. I want to  declare an interest as a member of Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council.  I also congratulate the Minister for his presence at the debate to listen to  the calls from the west. I am aware that he has roots there and certainly has a  particular interest in the area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask Members to support the motion rather than the  amendment &mdash; not on any party-political grounds &mdash; simply because Ministers can  already come together to discuss and deal with such issues as the neglect of  the west and how to improve its infrastructure and environment for job  creation: indeed, Members expect them to do so.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, as Mr Gallagher&rsquo;s motion says, what is needed is a  task force for the west that is charged with compiling a time-limited report on  the progress that is being made and which will set the pace for the way  forward. The western economic strategy team (WEST) has put together its plan. I  congratulate the councils in the west for banding together to start to put  together a programme to tackle the area&rsquo;s  needs. A similar approach worked in the Derry  area when demands were made for infrastructure and support for the second city,  the benefits of which can be seen. There has been a decentralisation of Departments into Derry. However, there has not been any decentralisation of Departments into  western council areas, with the possible  exception of Omagh, to which some Departments have moved from other  council areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A task force for the west must be a focus for the new  Administration. It must start to build a future for the west by identifying the  area&rsquo;s needs and developing a programme to deal with them. A task force and its  report are important factors in that. I call upon Invest NI to adopt a new approach to the west. There has  been no drive to bring industry into the west. Historically, any  industry in the west has come about through the entrepreneurial skills of local  people. Those industries have been successful; indeed, they have become world  leaders. For example, 80% of quarry machinery for the rest of the world is manufactured in the west, particularly in  the Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council area. That demonstrates how local people have recognised the  neglect, lack of jobs and infrastructure in the area and have banded together  and brought forward their own programme to develop world-leading industry.  Those entrepreneurial skills must be developed and supported. Although there  are many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the area, those  businesses have developed as far as they can.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A drive is required to turn those businesses into exporters  and to put them into the international market. Invest NI can perform a major  task by encouraging those businesses to develop in such a way that we do not  simply end up with good family businesses, albeit with an increase in jobs, but  in a way that develops those businesses as exporters.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am interested to hear the Member talk about people banding together in the  west of the Province. Will he consider all the manufacturing companies that  have come together under the industrial derating campaign? Those companies  would tell the Member that they hope that  he and his party will support all possible measures to keep industrial  rates down as a means of securing the future of those companies in the west of  the Province that currently export goods.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  That is a discussion for another motion. My party&rsquo;s support for derating has  certainly been forthcoming. This matter is not framed by the west whingeing  about what it has not got, but is about the development  of skills to show what it can achieve in the future. The motion is  concerned with the development of the west and how it can foster the necessary  skills to achieve that aim.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At a conference in Dungannon last week, as part of the  Flight of the Earls festival, we were told that a programme is urgently needed  to address the skills issue if we want to reap the benefits in, perhaps, eight to 10 years time. We need a programme that will  ensure that the skills exist to develop future industry. We must start to shift the manufacturing base into an  export role, and we must start to  develop the current InterTradeIreland programme, expanding it to ensure  that we have a better future.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>:  Having lived west of the Bann for several years, I have considerable sympathy  with the motives behind Mr Gallagher&rsquo;s motion. We are told that more people are  in work and that fewer are unemployed, but economic  inactivity remains high. Historically, earnings in the west are below  the Northern Ireland  average and 16% of all recent redundancies have occurred in the west. Those are  quite alarming figures.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I was interested to be reminded of the strong manufacturing base that exists in the west. In  Cookstown, 23% of the workforce is involved in manufacturing. In  Dungannon, that figure is 29%; in Fermanagh, it is 18%; in Omagh, it is 12%;  and in Strabane, it is 29%.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have taken an ambiguous attitude towards derating in the  manufacturing industry, as illustrated in the Assembly debate in June 2006, of  which Members have a record, and in the motion that I proposed in June this  year. I sincerely hope that the Assembly will decide to support our  manufacturers in a practical way on industrial rates. That seems to me,  perhaps, to be more relevant to manufacturing than chasing the Varney Review on  the reduction of corporation tax.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that a study has been undertaken by the western  economic strategy team. That has already been referred to, and the report,  covering the period 2006-08, is very good. Other initiatives are ongoing. The  seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in Northern Ireland is 3&middot;7%, which is  the lowest rate on record. That is lower than the rate for the UK, which is 5&middot;4%, and it is the lowest of all  the UK  regions. Despite that, we have clear evidence that the UK regional policy  is not working. Two days ago, I received a copy of &lsquo;Institute  of Directors Northern Ireland News&rsquo;,  from which I quote Professor Mike Smyth of the University of Ulster  on policy fault lines:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The ongoing discussions with HM Treasury (the  Varney Review) have highlighted a  number of serious fault lines in government policy.</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">For me, the biggest  fault line is the inescapable conclusion that UK regional policy is not working.  Real economic convergence among the UK&rsquo;s  lagging regions (Northern Ireland,  Wales, the North of England, Scotland, etc) is not happening. In  fact, GVA per head over the past 15 years has been diverging from the UK average in  most regions. Surprise, surprise, the only regions not diverging from average  living standards are London,  the South East and the South West.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned for the future of the economy for all of us.  The economy will continue to be a difficult issue with very low growth &mdash; as low  as 1%, some have predicted. There are bound  to be considerable pressures on our economy, and the much-publicised  economic package has failed to materialise. However, we must continue to tackle  the problems of deprivation and social exclusion in our most disadvantaged  areas, and that certainly includes west of the Bann.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is essential that DETI continues to improve  jobs and opportunities for employment throughout Northern Ireland. More needs to be  done. The best task force that we could muster at this time would comprise our  Ministers. For that reason, I support the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: Mr  Deputy Speaker, I thank you for allowing me  to speak on this important motion. Perhaps I have some authority to  speak on this, having spent the past 21  years of my life living in the west &mdash; without giving my age away, I  spent the first 30 years living in the east.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot recommend the amendment because it has been  proposed for two reasons only: to remove the words &ldquo;task force&rdquo;, and to remove  the words &ldquo;North-South&rdquo;. I agree with Lord Morrow that he and Tommy Gallagher  are singing from the same hymn sheet. However, the word &ldquo;investigate&rdquo; is not  strong enough. We need something solid here, and a task force seems right to  me. Therefore, I support the motion but cannot accept the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend Mr Gallagher for two reasons: first, for proposing this important motion for debate; and,  secondly, for including the whole of the west in the motion. Lord Morrow  said that some 200,000 people live in the west. Last time I looked west of the  Bann, 404,000 people were living there. That is a significant number.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is good that Mr Gallagher included the two large  counties of Tyrone and Fermanagh. When I refer to the west, I include Derry, but I will focus a little on the two counties of  Tyrone and Fermanagh. Do not forget that Tyrone is the largest and most deprived  of the six counties. The establishment of an  economic development task force for our region would help to bring the  two counties, Tyrone and Fermanagh, together, and they would both benefit from  each other. Such a task force would promote economic development on all fronts  in both counties and would, therefore, greatly benefit everyone across the  North.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">People often ask what we in the west have to offer. Tourism  has been mentioned already, and it remains, and will remain, a major  contributor to the economy in Northern Ireland  &mdash; I am thinking of the Sperrins, the Fermanagh lakes and, of course, our  wonderful Ulster American Folk Park. Economic development is measured in terms of jobs, members and  income. It results in improvements in human development, education, health,  choice and environmental sustainability.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have to say &mdash; coming not so much from Belfast, but even further east than that &mdash;  that it is quite obvious to me that many things are Belfast-centred. It has  been said in the past that Northern    Ireland stops at Dungannon, and Mr Gallagher  mentioned that the motorway to Dungannon, which was built 40 years ago, has not  been extended beyond Dungannon as promised. Some people would be certain that Northern Ireland  stops at Lisburn. Everything is centred on the periphery, which is a  contradiction.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The west has been neglected for far too long, and it is  time that that was put right. There is a lack of public-sector jobs in the  west. It has been noted by a former Minister and many others that many people in  Omagh work in the Civil Service but have to travel to Belfast to do their jobs. There is no reason  for not moving those jobs to the west.  Strabane has lost hundreds of jobs in recent years, and no agencies have  moved in to replace that lost employment. It is now official that many people  are travelling out of &mdash; and even moving out  of &mdash; the counties of Fermanagh and Tyrone because of that. Indeed, there  is a brain drain in the south-west.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are no universities in the west except, of course, in  the Maiden City, although the development of local  colleges is very important, and I am thankful for the one in Omagh.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members know my views  on the plans for healthcare provision. They do not cater for everyone in  Tyrone and Fermanagh, and there has been the unacceptable closure of three  acute hospitals that served the people of Tyrone: three, not one. The Mid-Ulster Hospital in Magherafelt looks after the  people in Cookstown. We must have adequate, modern healthcare facilities to cover all medical eventualities in both counties,  and not just for our people &mdash; we  need them for tourists as well.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Roads and railways have been mentioned. There is no  motorway network in the west at all. We do not even have a dual carriageway &mdash;  Mr Gallagher can correct me, if there is one in Fermanagh &mdash; except for one  small one in Tyrone, just outside Cookstown. The roads are shocking, and there  is no railway network. Multinational companies must be encouraged to come to the west. An economic development task force  would ensure that Tyrone and Fermanagh attracted important developments  in line with what is happening in other areas of Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This is a new era for Northern   Ireland, and we all want a modern Northern Ireland in a modern Europe.  That means investing in, developing and modernising all of Northern Ireland,  and that includes the west. I support the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to discuss economic development matters today. I wish  that we had many more such opportunities, because &mdash; and I think that we all  accept this &mdash; the economy is the biggest challenge facing the new Executive. We  must ensure that nowhere &mdash; and nobody &mdash;is left out of what we hope are going to  be years of prosperity ahead. We also want to ensure that every social class  and every part of Northern    Ireland benefit from a boost in the economy.  That is a huge challenge for all of us, and that is why I support the  amendment. It is much better to investigate rather than create a task force  that would mark out the west as the sick man of Northern Ireland. That would not be good for the west, especially  when it is not an entirely accurate perception.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I read with interest the action plan developed by the  western economic strategy team (WEST) and noted that it has found that research  has identified the region to be characterised by, among other things: an  entrepreneurial spirit; regional diversity; a spirit of collaboration; a strong  economic mix; a sustainable rural economy; and a high level of skills. Those  are some positive points for the west.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We all accept that there are problems. All Members who have  spoken in the debate mentioned accessibility, and there is no doubt that it is  a problem. Investment in the roads infrastructure is sound investment and gives  good value. We have only to look at our neighbours in the South to see the economic benefits that it can bring.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Economic inactivity is also a problem. It is worse than the  Northern Ireland  average. Coming from the Ards Borough Council area, where 29,000 people are  economically inactive at present &mdash; the fourth highest figure in Northern Ireland  &mdash; I have considerable sympathy with the west. I note that in the past there has  been a lack of available industrial land, particularly in the Strabane District  Council area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, if we create a task force, as called for in the  motion, there will be a case for a task force for every area of Northern Ireland.  I could make a case for my Strangford constituency where the economy has been  decimated in recent years by a huge downturn in the traditional textile  industries, and I am sure that colleagues from Belfast and elsewhere could make similar  cases. We have all been badly affected, and we all suffer from disadvantages,  and, to carry on with Leslie Cree&rsquo;s theme, perhaps the best task force would be  the Executive itself, of which the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment  is a part.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is another case to be made against a task force. We  all have experience of task forces that build up expectations and deliver  nothing. There are any number of task force reports simply gathering dust and  not being acted upon. It is essential that we place this important role in the  proper context. All areas of Northern    Ireland have issues that prevent them from  participating in the upturn in the economy, and those must be overcome.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the investigation called for in the amend&shy;ment. It  is right that such an investigation be placed in the proper context, as outlined in the amendment, which is that  of the Programme for Government, the Budget and  the comprehensive spending review. There it would receive better  attention, as well as the appropriate resources, in the context of the  Executive&rsquo;s aim to lift the Northern    Ireland economy for everyone.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  I speak in favour of the motion, and express some disappointment at the  amendment. Listening to Lord Morrow&rsquo;s contribution, I felt that, in many ways,  he supported the motion. However, he appeared to rule out the establishment of  a task force, as if that were some challenge to the Minister&rsquo;s authority.  Although the motion is a challenge to the Minister, it recognises his authority to put together a task force and to  implement its findings. If the DUP were to reflect on that point, I  believe that it would support the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The four district councils of Strabane, Omagh, Cookstown  and Fermanagh, along with Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council, make up  the counties of Tyrone and Fermanagh. It is a vast, rural area, with a diverse,  rural population and some major towns. Those counties suffer from an appalling  lack of infrastructure. There are no railway lines at all. People there do not  even have a railway to complain about, never mind late trains or bad  timekeeping. Put simply, there is no rail network in those counties.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">They have no motorway and no dual carriageway. There is no  regional airport, and the recent debates about Shannon and Belfast airports showed how crucial a  regional airport is to the development of any geographical area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are no gas pipelines, and no potential for bringing gas into the west. I am concerned that,  if recent reports of the potential gas find on the Fermanagh-Cavan  border come to fruition, the only pipeline will be one to take gas out of the  area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The water and sewerage infrastructure is not sufficiently progressed to allow for ongoing  development of the area. Furthermore,  there is very limited broadband access.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The economic indicators &mdash; employment, unemploy&shy;ment and  poverty &mdash; clearly show that the area needs attention. It needs a task force to  focus attention on the area, and that task force&rsquo;s findings should be  implemented.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The potential that existed for there to be decentral&shy;isation  of Departments and agencies has not been delivered on. Unfortunately, the amend&shy;ment  &mdash; although those speaking to it almost speak in favour of the motion &mdash; misses  the key point, which is that a task force would bring with it clarity, and an  indication that, at last, the neglected infrastructure and all other areas of  neglect in the west would be challenged.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the DUP to rethink the content of its amend&shy;ment. In  many ways, that party is going along with Tommy Gallagher&rsquo;s thoughts. However,  it misses the key point, which is the establishment of a task force. As I have  said, the motion is not a challenge to the Minister. It recognises that he has  the authority to put a task force together and to bring its findings to  fruition.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-left:14.2pt;">I urge all Members to support  the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  Although I represent North Down, I am originally from, and my wider family  still live in, and, indeed, at, the centre  of the universe &mdash; Plumbridge, in the  heart of the Sperrins. I have therefore an ongoing interest in the  issues involved in the debate.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Does the Member accept that he is widely regarded in west Tyrone as an honorary  west Tyrone man?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  I thank the Member for that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For many years, the  councils&rsquo; economic development units have been doing sterling work. They  have come together in teams and produced many glossy and expensive brochures,  some of which I have here. However, that work has never quite led to a proper  plan that would allow the area west of the Bann to sort itself out and to get  up there in the serious economic stakes. Perhaps the time has come for the  Executive to co-ordinate those issues and finally produce a plan for success.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I draw Members&rsquo; attention to the excellent regional  development strategy that appeared during the time of the first Assembly. It  took a long time to develop, but we seem to have lost sight of it. At the time,  it was the envy of England, Scotland and the Republic. It produced  a plan for Northern Ireland  that cut across all kinds of issues. Let us remind ourselves of some of them.  It noted that farming would become more difficult as the money from Europe dried up and that farmers would need to diversify,  and not just on the farms: some of them, or their children, might have to take  part-time employment in local towns and villages. Consequently, there would be  a need to develop SMEs in those towns and villages to cater for those in the  local population seeking work and for  farmers looking for part-time jobs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Transport, and the transport networks, was a major issue.  Recently, I had cause to travel from Omagh to Enniskillen, and I do not want to  reopen the dreaded hospital debate, but, my goodness, you would not want to be  taken poorly in Greencastle or Cranagh on a winter&rsquo;s night, when Roads Service  is unable to grit the roads and it is icy, and to be heading for a hospital in  Enniskillen. Chances are that you would be long gone before you reached Omagh.  There is a major issue about the infrastructure in that mountainous area that  goes right down into Fermanagh and right through Tyrone. It does not affect  only medical situations; if people need to transport goods or to meet business  colleagues, they face the same difficulties. Everything takes ages.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Strabane and Omagh  area has the fastest-growing population in Northern Ireland. How are we to  meet the education needs of young people and provide them with the skills that  employers require? How do we encourage young people to stay in the area? We need  to create jobs, which will probably be provided by SMEs rather than by major  companies coming into the area &mdash; home-grown businesses are better as a rule. In  order to keep young people there, we need to allow them to live there. On one  level, I am quite encouraged that Planning Policy Statement 14 (PPS 14) has  gone back to the drawing board. However, that is not to say that there is not a  need to protect the countryside. I was in Donegal recently, and it is just  appalling. I spent a lot of my childhood there, and what has been done there is iniquitous. I do not want Tyrone and  Fermanagh to follow suit, with bungalows shoved in everywhere. There  must be some sort of planning policy, but what I do not understand is why those  who say that they are interested in rural  planning do not want to allow people to rebuild on the sites of existing  houses.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I call on the Minister to revisit the regional  development strategy and to produce a cross-cutting plan to establish economic  development in the west. I support the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  In speaking to my colleague Mr Gallagher&rsquo;s motion, I do not want to rehash or  repeat his points.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, in this new politically stable atmosphere, we want  economic growth, so we must facilitate and support that growth.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Investment in job creation and infrastructure is necessary  if we are to realise the work of the task force that Tommy Gallagher has  proposed. Our Civil Service jobs must be decentralised, and economic advantages  will result from the regeneration of our district council towns through that decentralisation. Many of those  towns have been totally denuded in recent years as a result of the loss  of vital Civil Service jobs, and that has had a ripple effect on local economies. However, as well as the  economic advantages, decentralisation has clear social advantages. For example,  people with young families are forced to travel day and daily to Belfast to work, getting  stuck in traffic jams in so doing, and decentral&shy;isation would mean that that  would no longer be the case. Decentralisation would also bring environmental  advantages. Urban congestion and fuel consumption would be reduced, as would  the cost of travel. Many people who face those costs are on low incomes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McFarland has just absented himself from the Chamber,  but he &mdash; and Mr Hamilton &mdash; referred to planning, which is crucial in order to  make land available. For example, the introduction of PPS 14 &mdash; although I am  not sure how to describe it now &mdash; has meant that long-established family, local  and rural businesses have suffered. In a particular case that readily springs  to mind, one businessman could not expand his business, which was established  in a rural area, to create an extra seven jobs. PPS 14 has had detrimental  effects. Recently, it has also placed an obstacle in the way of the creation of  potentially 150 to 300 jobs. A job-creation scheme is available, but people  have to wait two and a half years for a refusal under that package. Businessmen  and investors simply will not put up with that type of behaviour.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Instead of presenting obstacles and reasons for not  creating jobs, Invest Northern Ireland  should be facilitating job creation and doing what it can, within reason, to  enable developers to create jobs in those areas that have suffered for many  years as a result of economic disadvantage, high levels of unemployment and  deprivation. The task force must tackle those planning  obstacles at the pre-planning application stage to iron out  infrastructural problems, such as difficulties with roads and water. Other  planning policy issues and problems with  departmental matters such as Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development food manufact&shy;uring schemes could be smoothed out at that stage, as  could cases in which Invest Northern Ireland should be facilitating job  creation but is delaying it by making negative comments to the Planning  Service.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If the task force tackles those problems, we can arrive at  a situation in which we, as Members of a new Assembly can, through the new  Executive, create jobs for those who have elected us. If those problems are  tackled, a developer who is interested in creating jobs will not be left for  two or two and a half years waiting to hear nothing but the refusal of his  planning application. Difficulties must be ironed out well before then. We must  move into the twenty-first century. The bureaucrats  in Invest Northern Ireland  who are hindering the process must note that they are there to do a job:  to help developers to boost the economy and create jobs. We cannot have those  bureaucrats giving developers reasons not to invest. People want encouragement  and support, and a &ldquo;why not?&rdquo; approach and a profess&shy;ionalism should be there  for all to see. We, as elected representatives, demand that type of approach.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support my colleague&rsquo;s proposal to establish a task  force. As a representative of what is referred to as the rural west, I have  related some of my experiences to the House. I hope that we can learn from some  of those experiences, and I hope that in future we will be in a position to help to create jobs with maximum  efficiency.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I wholeheartedly welcome the  motion and thank the Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone for proposing it. I  also welcome the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment to the House today. It is important that the economic  deficit in West Tyrone be discussed on the first day of this new session;  again, I commend Mr Gallagher for bringing it to the House.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We, in the west, are living with an economic deficit. The  Assembly and the Executive have a great responsibility to redress the  inequality that exists, particularly between east and west. One of the earlier  Members who spoke said that that case could be made for practically any area. I  disagree. In August, the Department for Social Develop&shy;ment published a report  &mdash; &lsquo;Households Below Average Income 2005/06&rsquo;. A key finding of that report,  which is relevant to the debate, was that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Individuals living in the West of the Province were  most at risk of being in low income. Those living in the East of the Province  were least at risk.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Why is that? I am going to whinge and complain about it. It  is because there are no jobs, a lack of investment and poor infrastructure. All those points have been made, but I want to emphasise  the case: there is a difference between east and west.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gallagher mentioned tourism signature projects. There is  a route in my area that the hon Member for West Tyrone will recognise. It  starts in Strabane and goes over Ligfordrum into Plumbridge, up the Glenelly Valley  and into County Derry. I guarantee that it is one of the  most beautiful routes in this country, equal to anything in the Mournes, on the  Causeway or in the glens. Where is our signature project? It does not exist. Mr  Gallagher made an important point, and I support him fully.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">These days I often pass the Titanic Quarter. Fair play to  the people who are working on that project. In May, the Executive gave &mdash; how  much was it? &mdash; &pound;25 million to that project.  Fair play to whoever is responsible for the project. There are loads  more millions available for it, according to the report on the website. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It does not matter which party a Minister comes from. I am  speaking for the west. Whatever Ministers  happen to be in the Executive, it is for all of them to make those  decisions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In discussing this matter, several Members have spoken of  WEST &mdash; the western economic strategy team. I must say right away that I sat on  that body, as did my council colleague on the other side of the House,  Councillor Allan Bresland, who is now also a Member for West Tyrone. I have  great respect for that group&rsquo;s work. If we are to implement the task force &mdash;  and I support the motion and the establishment of such an employment task force  &mdash; that group will make a good reference point. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  I am pleased that the motion is being  debated today, coming as I do from Stewartstown on the western shores of Lough Neagh and representing Mid  Ulster. I am well placed to discuss the economic difficulties in the west of  the Province. The economic recovery in Northern Ireland since 1998 has  been remarkable, but hardly surprising. The IRA campaign of terror was designed  to bring Ulster  to its knees economically, and to that end, we had numerous bomb attacks on  town centres, hotels and restaurants.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Such activity was designed to destroy our economy and to  ensure that local investment dried up, while potential outside investment  stayed away. Thankfully, those days appear to be behind us.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the whole country suffered economic depression due  to IRA terrorist attacks over 30 years, I contend that the particular  circumstances of the west of the Province meant that the impact of that  depression was even more pronounced in that region. The lack of a modern  transport infrastructure is a huge issue. There is no railway line throughout a huge swathe of the west, barring  that which runs from Belfast to Londonderry to the far north. Promises that were made  back in 1960, when the west&rsquo;s railway lines were torn up, were not <span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">delivered upon, and, to this day, we still have no  motorw</span>ay except that which begins at the outskirts of Dungannon.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The west of the Province suffers from the traditional  Belfast-based mentality that civilisation ends at Glengormley and Lisburn. To  put it another way, if something is not within 10 miles of Belfast, it is not worth going to. I have no  doubt that such thinking, even subconsciously, has clouded the opinions and  decisions of policy makers in the past and continues to do so to this day. Even  given a benign interpretation of events, Belfast  has seen a great deal of development, such as the Titanic Quarter, the  Waterfront Hall, the Odyssey Arena and Victoria Square. The Belfast lobby is not  content with those; look at the outcry there was when John Lewis dared to try  to move as far west as the city of Lisburn. Belfast obviously needs it share of  development, but so do the rest of us. Belfast&rsquo;s  traffic congestion will only get worse if more and more people are forced to  leave the west of the Province to commute to Belfast for work, or move to fuel the already  crazy property market in the city.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The west of the Province has traditionally had pockets of  extremely high unemployment, such as used to be found in Strabane. However,  problems have also arisen from the traditional reliance on agriculture and  related industries for employment opportunities. The agriculture industry has  been beset with problems in recent years due to foot-and-mouth disease, BSE,  low farm income and high feed prices. Those factors have compounded an already  difficult situation, and many farmers and businesses in the textile industries  are at their wit&rsquo;s end, laying off staff, and, in many cases, giving up  altogether.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have no doubt that the west of the Province could benefit  from a task force, but we have seen task force initiatives on several occasions  in the past &mdash; talk is cheap, and nothing is done. We require the political will  to ensure that real action will follow any recomm&shy;endations for the  establishment of a task force.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mr Dodds)</strong>: I congratulate Mr Gallagher for securing the debate.  As the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment, I share Mr Gallagher&rsquo;s desire to see the west of Northern Ireland  continuing to benefit from a steady  improvement in the economy. References have been made to my grass roots  in Fermanagh. Although I was born in Londonderry,  I was brought up in Fermanagh, and I am all too aware of the issues in the west  of the Province. However, I do not think that we should set false  confrontations in this Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is not about east versus west; it is about  raising all of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  economy so that everybody can benefit, paying absolute regard to the particular  challenges and disadvantages that affect particular areas, whether in the west,  the north-west, the south or certain parts of Belfast. All Assembly Members could, can, and  do, rightly, bring issues of particular concern to me and other Ministers. It  is important that we take all of those into account while developing for Northern Ireland  &mdash; as a whole &mdash; an economic strategy that lifts the entire economy and drives it  forward.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  The Minister mentioned a matter that is of concern to me and other Members as  regards the wording of the motion. The geographical location stated is quite  prescriptive &mdash; if it went any further west, it would be in Nova Scotia &mdash; and  western areas such as Limavady and  Londonderry have been excluded.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>:  The Member has drawn attention to a point that was mentioned in the debate.  Perhaps those who tabled the debate will explain during the winding-up speech  why they have defined the west in such a way and why some areas have been  excluded.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am simply making the  point that there are particular challenges and issues in all parts of  the Province, some of which are more exaggerated and emphasised in some areas  than others. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the particular challenges and  issues that affect the west of the Province, as defined by Mr Gallagher.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, Northern    Ireland has enjoyed sustained economic  growth over the past 15 years. The economy continues  to perform well in historic terms. Employment levels are higher than  ever, and we are benefiting from lower unemployment. As Members have said, the Northern Ireland  unemployment rate has remained below the 5% mark for over two years. The  current unemployment rate of 2&middot;3% is one of the lowest in the United Kingdom.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, stating those  figures does not underestimate the challenges that remain, not just for  the west, but for all of Northern    Ireland. That includes the need to address  lower levels of productivity and private sector earnings, the high levels of  economic inactivity and the relatively small private sector, compared with the  public sector. A number of Government strategies are in place, including the  regional innovation strategy, the regional development strategy, the Department  for Employment and Learning&rsquo;s skills strategy and the investment strategy for Northern Ireland.  However, it is important that the new devolved Administration builds on those  measures to make the economy more sustainable and create the wealth that will  enable us to pursue the level and quality of provision that we want across Northern Ireland.  That is why the Executive are highlighting the economy for special attention in  the Programme for Government and comprehensive spending review process.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">No one in the House or outside it could fail to have  noticed the emphasis that has been placed by all parties in the Executive on  the need to drive forward the economy. All parties have recognised that a  healthy, growing, vibrant economy is  essential to move forward, not only on the standard of living, but on  the provision of healthcare, education services and world-class environmental and housing provision. It is not a  question of the economy versus social provision; it is a matter of the  economy being central in order to provide the wherewithal to make progress on  the other issues.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members, not least the proposer of the motion,  have referred to roads, decentralisation, health matters, transportation,  railways, airports, planning, and several other matters. Those are legitimate  issues to raise when considering the development of the west. The motion,  however, calls on the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment to take action to assist the economic development of the  west. Those matters are outside my remit but they are matters for the Executive  as a whole. That is why it is important that a cross-cutting and collective  approach is taken.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is considerable merit in the amendment that has been  tabled. I am happy to deal with the issues that fall within my  responsibilities, but it is worth noting that the employment and unemployment  statistics for the western region are broadly similar to the Northern Ireland  average. There are pockets where that is not the case, just as there are areas  in any set of statistics that do not carry the broad thrust of those figures.  However, the latest figures demonstrate that, in the areas that are mentioned  in the motion, the overall positions in claimant-count unemployment, percentage  decrease in unemployment and increases in employee jobs are almost identical to the Northern Ireland average.  The one area where there is a marked difference is the economic inactivity  rate, which includes people on incapacity benefit, students and older people. I  will deal with that point shortly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall explain what my Department and its agencies are doing,  in partnership with other Departments, to support economic development in the  areas covered by Fermanagh, Omagh, Strabane, Dungannon and Cookstown councils.  DETI policy already recognises the problems that are faced by a number of  council areas in the west. The Department has disadvantaged-area maps, which  are based on the income and employ&shy;ment indicators of deprivation from the 2005  Northern Ireland  measure of multiple deprivation, and they designate  Strabane, Omagh, Cookstown and Dungannon as disadvantaged areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those areas are already designated. In practice, that means  that the Department and its agencies are committed to paying particular  attention to such areas when delivering  policies and programmes. I have ensured that that is the case. For example,  Invest Northern Ireland  has targets to attract 75% of all first-time inward investment projects to  locate in disadvantaged areas and to secure at least 40% of new business starts  there. The latest figures show that those targets are being met; indeed, the  figure for investment projects is some 80%.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">People talk about neglect, and so forth. It is a question  of balance and ensuring that we know what is happening and what measures are  already in place. Of course, there is room for improvement and certain factors must be taken into account as the areas  develop. Invest Northern    Ireland can also offer an enhanced  incentives package to companies wishing to locate projects in disadvantaged areas. The size of that package is  determined by the merits and scale of the project and the number and quality of  jobs available.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">An important role for  the Department for Employment and Learning is to address the high rate  of economic inactivity in order to encourage economic growth. Parts of the west  have some of the highest rates of economic inactivity in Northern Ireland,  a point that Lord Morrow and several other Members raised. Colleagues in the  Department for Employment and Learning, with whom my Department has a close  working relationship, have a comprehensive range of provisions available to  address the supply of labour and to help those who are economically inactive to  find work. That includes the Pathways to  Work initiative for people receiving incapacity benefit, which will be  available throughout Northern    Ireland by April 2008; it will be rolled out in Omagh and Dungannon next month.</p>
		    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Invest Northern    Ireland has regional offices in Omagh and  Enniskillen, and continues to engage at a local level with councils and other  stakeholders to deliver effective economic development activity in the west.  Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s officials are involved with various organisations in  the region that Members have mentioned, including WEST, to which several  favourable references have been made.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members have talked about taking action and task forces.  WEST provides an example of having done the work and produced a report.  Executive Ministers, as part of their discussions on the Programme for Government, the economy, the comprehensive spending  review and the Budget, must be able to take all such reports into account  rather than waiting for a task force that will not report until after those matters have been dealt with.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The regional office is supported by a full range of  programmes and initiatives from Invest Northern Ireland, which are available for  local companies. A dedicated ICT adviser for the western region offers  specialist advice to SMEs. That relates to a point that Mr Molloy raised on the  need to encourage family businesses to become more export oriented. He is  right, because that challenge faces not only the west, but everywhere in Northern Ireland,  which has a high percentage of SMEs. By investing in R&amp;D and innovation, my  Department&rsquo;s role is to encourage those enterprises to become outward looking,  export oriented and to increase productivity. Those areas are specifically  targeted in the west and must be targeted across Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Manufacturing has been mentioned, and reference was made to industrial rating. Members know about  the ongoing review that was instigated by the Department of Finance and  Personnel. The report of that review will be sent to the Executive and the  Assembly in due course. Industrial rating is an important issue for local manufacturers. I welcome many of Mr Cree&rsquo;s comments;  however, he seemed to say that the Varney Review of Tax Policy in Northern Ireland was somehow irrelevant when  compared with industrial rating, but he went on to talk about the need to  increase productivity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The critical point about the Varney Review is that it seeks to address how to achieve regional  convergence and increase Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  performance in comparison with other regions of the United Kingdom. The new tools and  instruments of financial policy that are being sought as part of the Varney  Review are required to drive forward the  economy and thereby make the major change that is needed to increase  productivity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If we continue to act as we have in the past, we will not  make the real difference that everyone wants to see in Northern Ireland.  There are many wonderful examples of  manufacturing companies in the west of the Province, and Members from  those areas will know them well.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate those companies that are doing so much in  the manufacturing sector and those that are involved in exports and in  substantial areas of trade. It is also clear that the west is benefiting from  increased investment in the service sector, and there are many examples of  that. There is also a strong ethos of entrepreneurship in the west. Over the  past five years, business start-up figures for the western region have been  consistently higher than the Northern    Ireland average. There is a danger that we  are talking the area down &mdash; there are challenges, but we should also recognise  the excellent work being done.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to tourism, my Executive colleagues and I are  mindful that tourism in Northern    Ireland has underperformed for the past 30  years, for obvious reasons. Tourism has an important part to play in our  economy and has enormous potential. Rural areas in the west of the Province  have an important role to play, and a regional tourism partnership has been  created in the west to drive forward the delivery of tourism at the strategic  level.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs McGill mentioned tourism signature projects and the  money that has been made available for the Titanic signature project. As she  seems puzzled as to where the money came from, I will clarify that for her. It  was achieved with the active endorsement of all members of the Executive,  including those Sinn F&eacute;in MLAs who represent the west and who voted for it. I  am therefore very surprised at her comments today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Infrastructure and telecommunications were also mentioned.  On several occasions, Members have mentioned  the inaccessibility of broadband to people in the west. According to  international investors, one of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  selling points is the fact that it is the only region &mdash; and was the first  region of the UK  &mdash; to have 100% broadband accessibility. The policy objective was pursued that  there should be no digital divide that would disadvantage remote areas such as  parts of the west, where customer volume alone would not justify private sector  involve&shy;ment. If Members have particular issues to raise about that, I will be  happy to take them on board.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the debate: it will help to draw attention to the problems and challenges that exist in the  economic development of the west. We should focus on that, and I assure  all Members that I will ensure that we will address those issues as part of the  Programme for Government, the comprehensive spending review, and in the Budget  discussions over the coming weeks.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The debate will be suspended at this point. We will return to it following  Question Time. Members may take their ease for a few moments.</p>

		    <p class="H3SectionHeading">ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading" style="margin-top:8.5pt;"><a name="5"></a>Office of the First Minister  and &nbsp;the Deputy First Minister</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Shared Future</p>
		    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr A  Maginness </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister  and the Deputy First Minister to detail what action had been taken  following the findings of the report &lsquo;The  Cost of Division - A Shared Future Strategy&rsquo;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=54/08>(AQO 54/08)</a></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister (Rev Dr Ian Paisley)</strong>: As the hon Member will know, the report was  commissioned by the previous Administration on 29 March 2006, was conducted and  finalised during direct rule. Although  commissioned by the previous Administration, it is an independent piece  of research and there are really no surprises in it. The final report was  presented by Deloitte in April 2007, prior to devolution.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister is totally committed to moving society  forward and making a real difference to the lives of all our people. Our  vision is for a future based on tolerance, equality, mutual respect and respect  for the rule of law. We shall bring forward proposals to the Assembly and to  the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First  Minister later this year to promote the  interests of the whole community and move towards the goal of a shared  future and a prosperous, peaceful and settled society.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I welcome the First Minister back from his holidays, and I wish him well for  the remainder of this year. I would not dare indulge in any religious matters. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On a technical point, the report referred to in my question  is not available in the Assembly Library, and it ought to be. In fact, I had  great difficulty in obtaining a copy from the First Minister&rsquo;s office.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The substance of the report reveals that &pound;1&middot;5 billion is  spent in Northern Ireland  as a result of division, which is a startling fact. That emphasises the need  for the First Minister and his colleagues to tackle the causes of that  division. Does he have any plans to tackle the peace lines that scar our towns  and cities throughout Northern    Ireland? That would be a welcome first step  in dealing with sectarianism and division in our society.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I thank the Member for the strange remarks that he made at the  beginning of his question. It is a pity that he had not been clearer about what  he was seeking. I assure him that copies of the report are available, and I  will see to it that he receives a copy at the end of today&rsquo;s sitting. I am  sorry that I cannot buy him a new pair of spectacles to see the religious  situation more clearly, but perhaps that will come. Even little pussycats open  their eyes at the end of certain days.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We want progress; we do not want barriers built across  parts of our land, but divisions must be dealt with before we can take down  those barriers. People have been murdered in our society, and it is after the  murders end that we can pull down the barriers. We must apply ourselves to many  other matters, but I want to say today that I am totally dedicated to seeing  peace in the Province that I love.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Does the First Minister agree with the suggestion in &lsquo;The Cost of Division &mdash; A  Shared Future Strategy&rsquo; that a a massive 66% reduction in the police budget would be desirable? Does he accept that if a  similar approach were applied to education and health, on the basis of  differential per capita expenditure, it would result in massive curtailment of  public services and job losses in the Province?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: It is all very well to ask a question like that; however, in the  present reality it is clear that the police need money to do their job  successfully. It would be wrong for any Member to suggest that we just slice  the police budget in order to paint a picture that does not deal with reality.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What alarms me are the constant attacks on Orange Halls and  on churches of all denominations. Those attacks  need to be rigorously stopped, and no clergyman should have to stand up and say that people are wrecking his  church, and that he took a photograph of those who did it, only to have the  police say they cannot use it.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: &lsquo;The Cost of Division &mdash; A Shared Future Strategy&rsquo; has been  sitting on the shelf for almost five months. We have important decisions to  take regarding the Budget, the Programme for Government and the comprehensive  spending review. Can the First Minister give me a guarantee that, at this very  late stage, with a closing window of opportunity, the results of the report  will be fully taken into account in the consideration of those important  matters, so that we can start to save money by avoiding duplication and  re-invest money in improving the quality of public services for the entire  community?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I inform the hon Member that it is not our report. It is a report  that has come to us, but no Member has voted for it. The report must be  discussed in the Assembly, and go through the proper process of proceeding to  establish by legislation what Members agree with.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have heard that the report has not been largely  circulated. The first thing that we should do is see that it is largely  circulated and that people know what it asks. However, there is no easy way to  bring the matter to fruition. That could be done by legislation, but that does  not mean that it will be brought to real fruition until it is carried out and  conformed to.</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading">Interdepartmental Liaison</p>
		    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr Gardiner </strong>asked the Office of the  First Minister and the Deputy First  Minister to identify which specific operational areas required close  liaison between staff working for OFMDFM and staff working for other Northern  Ireland Departments.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=42/08>(AQO 42/08)</a></p>
		    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">18. <strong>Mr  McCallister </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First  Minister how many staff in OFMDFM were involved in co-ordinating the work of  the Northern Ireland Departments, and to identify examples of the kind of work that co-ordination entails. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=87/08>(AQO 87/08)</a></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I shall answer questions 2 and  18 together.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Office of the First  Minister and the Deputy First Minister was first established as a  Department on 1 December 1999, but has changed significantly over the last  eight years as its role and responsibilities have continued to develop. As  additional roles have been added, the  Department has had to grow to accommodate them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On 1 December 2000, the Department had 283 staff. Figures  published in September two years later showed that that figure had risen to 417  just after devolution was suspended. Under Mr Trimble, the figure had almost  doubled. Current staffing levels are broadly similar  to those of the previous devolved Administration. As of 1 September 2007 there were 408 staff working in  the Department, therefore fewer.<u style="text-underline:black double;"></u></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It should be recognised that the Office of the First  Minister and the Deputy First Minister is a fully functioning Department of the  Northern Ireland Administration. Its work can be divided into several separate, but interrelated, roles. It provides  administrative support and facilities  for the operation of the institutions of  Government: the Executive; the British-Irish Council; and the  North/South Ministerial Council. It also has a wide range of policy  responsibilities, some of which were conferred on it by statute. It has a  policy-making remit for economic policy, which takes in the reinvest&shy;ment and reform initiative (RRI). OFMDFM also works  with the Department of Finance and Personnel and the Strategic Investment Board  (SIB) to assist in the implementation of an effective investment strategy for Northern Ireland  and in the development of a compre&shy;hensive Programme for Government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department also has significant policy respons&shy;ibilities in the areas of rights, equality and good  relations. Those include legislative  and non-legislative programmes that cover anti-discrimination and  equality matters, and cross-cutting policy in such areas as race, disability,  gender, children, young people, victims and survivors and community relations.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Member wants a solution to a problem for which his party was  responsible. That party brought in all the extra workers. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I remind Members that they should not speak from a sedentary position.  The First Minister is speaking.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I am not taking any points of order. Mr McNarry, resume your seat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I am surprised that the hon Members should be alarmed to hear the  truth today. I did not appoint any of the OFMDFM staff: they were in their  posts when I took the position of First Minister. By the grace of God, not all  of them will be there when I leave, because we must look at our own house and  see how money can be saved.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department provides a range of central services for the  entire Northern Ireland Administration through the Northern Ireland Bureau in  Washington and the Brussels office, and by taking a lead role on cross-cutting  issues such as providing advice and guidance on the machinery of Government,  drafting legislation, civil emergencies, planning, sustained development, the  review of public administration (RPA), freedom of information and public  appointments. The Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister  also serves the needs of its Ministers. For that purpose, the Department maintains a small private office that  supports the business needs of four Ministers. In order to carry out  those roles effectively, it is essential that our staff work closely with  colleagues in other Departments, employees of public bodies and representatives  from organisations in the private and  voluntary sector. In short, OFMDFM is a unique Department that plays a  central role at the heart of the Northern  Ireland Administration.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I am sure that I will hear that sermon another time. The First Minister will be  aware that one man&rsquo;s co-ordination may be another man&rsquo;s duplication. In light  of that, will he make a public commitment that he will take all steps to  simplify the process of government and end all instances of duplication?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will he consider reporting back to the Assembly, and to the  Committee for the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister,  on progress on that front?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;"><em>2.45 pm</em></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: All I can say to the Member is &mdash; yes. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I was almost exhausted listening to the First Minister&rsquo;s answer. With that  workload, I am glad he is giving up one of his other roles.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the First Minister accept that, before new  appointments are made in OFMDFM, a review of current staffing levels should  take place in what many would regard as a very overweight Department?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: That is a bigger job than the hon Member imagines. I am sure that  he would not want us to cut down on the planning machinery when we need more  help in that area. We have to look at the matter over the broad line, and do  whatever is necessary after careful consideration.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Does the First Minister know of any liaison between his staff and other  Departments on the issue of health  screening for young people participating in sport? We are all aware of  the recent tragic deaths, particularly in County Tyrone  and elsewhere in Ireland, within a matter of days. Will the First Minister  tell us &mdash; particularly as it  has implications for the Departments of Health; Education; and Culture,  Arts and Leisure &mdash; whether there has been liaison on the matter?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Executive are meeting this week, as the Member knows, and that  is one of the matters that we will have before us.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>:  What action did the First Minister take in support of the Department of  Agriculture during the foot-and-mouth crisis?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I did my very best, as did my deputy, to be on the spot. We  called a meeting of the Executive, and both of us used the contacts that we had <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">in various offices and Government bodies,  and I belie</span>ve that we were very successful in what we did, especially in losing so little time in getting our  agricultural produce not out of the market, but into the market. We did  very well indeed.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Equality Agenda</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Molloy </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister  to outline how it intends to address the equality agenda.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=6/08>(AQO 6/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">15. <strong>Ms  Anderson </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First  Minister to report on the appointment of a Victims&rsquo; Commissioner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=115/08>(AQO 115/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: With permission, I will take questions 3 and 15 together. The  Office of the First <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">Minister and the Deputy  First Minister is fully commit</span>ted to achieving equality of opportunity  for all citizens of Northern    Ireland. We will continue to promote  equality of opportunity through legislation where appropriate, and through a  range of policy initiatives based on objective need. The framework of  anti-discrimination legislation has been strengthened recently in a number of  areas, for example on age and disability. We will develop proposals for further  legislative change with Executive colleagues and the departmental Committees as  appropriate. In addition, work aimed at promoting social inclusion for  vulnerable groups is continuing, and we will endeavour to make further progress  in that important area.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Does the First Minister agree that the promotion and protection of the rights  of older people is an essential component of the equality agenda? Recently, I  listened to a presentation by Help the Aged on issues concerning older people.  What progress has been made on the appointment of a commissioner for older  people?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I have to declare an interest in elderly people and speak for  them, which I do gladly. When I look at people who are a lot younger than I am,  I think that my health is doing fairly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Yes, a view can be taken that there should be a  commissioner for older people. However, it needs careful consideration and  debate, and we must also look at the timing. I cannot see it happening in the  next two years, as it will require a lot of work. Nevertheless, the subject  should be kept before us, and I will be happy if it happens earlier.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  In the light of the First Minister&rsquo;s response, will his Department, in  co-ordination with all Departments across the Executive, ensure that tackling  poverty among our elderly citizens in Northern Ireland is made a  priority? Although a commissioner would be welcome, we do not need one to  achieve that. The matter requires urgent attention. There are far too many  elderly people living in poverty, and fuel poverty is a big issue as we approach  another winter. Will the First Minister give an assurance that tackling poverty  among the elderly will be a priority for the Executive <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">in advance of appointing a commissioner for the elde</span>rly?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Member is correct. It is very important to tackle poverty  among the elderly: those in poverty must be brought out of poverty, and that  will be a task on its own. I have not had almost 60 years&rsquo; experience in  pastoral work not to know how many poverty-stricken families we have, and the difficulties  that they face &mdash; especially one-parent <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">families.  It is almost impossible for a single parent to do</span> a job, get the  children to school and get the housework done. We should all be sympathetic to  that and do our best to alleviate those circumstances. As the right hon Member  knows, it cannot be done easily. We must apply ourselves to it. I said to a man  the other night that Northern    Ireland needs a good injection of cash. I  hope that something will persuade the Prime Minister to realise that he has a  responsibility when we come to settle our budget.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I welcome the First Minister&rsquo;s comments about the framework for tackling  inequality. In the absence of an interim  Programme for Government, will the First Minister tell the House what  measures are being taken to tackle poverty and the lack of social inclusion,  and how often they are reviewed? Will the First Minister give further details  of when the strategy for sexual orientation will be published and assure  Members that the time frame for the introduction of the single equality Bill  will be brought before the House in 2008? Will he further ensure that the  comprehensive spending review will not adversely affect &mdash; directly or indirectly &mdash; the most disadvantaged in our  community?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Of course we must have a Programme for Government. All parties  must take part in that debate and bring forward their proposals. That matter is  underway, and we must press on. I want to see the Programme for Government, and  what steps will be taken on those issues, as soon as possible.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Single Equality Bill</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Ms Lo </strong>asked  the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to report on the  progress of the single equality Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=61/08>(AQO  61/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">13. <strong>Mr D  Bradley </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First  Minister to detail what progress had been made on the single equality Bill,  including the time frame for introduction of the legislation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=21/08>(AQO 21/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: With permission, I will take questions 4 and 13 together. Policy  proposals on single equality legislation are being developed, and Ministers will consider the options in consultation with  Committee and Executive colleagues  over the coming months. This is an important issue, and there has been  significant consultation with the public, key stakeholders and international  experts. It is a complex area. Officials are working on detailed proposals for  a single equality Bill, which Ministers will, of course, wish to consider in  full detail.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive will also consider any other legislative  priorities and will decide, in consultation with the Assembly, business  planners and Committees, when legislation is to be introduced. It would not be  appropriate to set firm dates for the introduction of such legislation before  Ministers had taken decisions on those issues.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: The  proposal was put forward more than six years ago, when I was a commissioner in  the Equality Commission. Will the First  Minister now firmly commit to a timetable for single equality  legislation or will he, once again, put it on the long finger?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I cannot commit myself to a timescale &mdash; I wish that I could. I  would like to do it tomorrow, but that is not possible. We must take time. The  Member was once a commissioner, so she knows how long it has been since a  single equality Bill was first proposed. However, even with her smile and  personality, she was unable to move the Equality Commission. She would not  expect a tough old man such as me to be able to sway the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>: Will the First Minister at least provide Members with details  of the progress that has been made on a single equality Bill?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I will be able to do that when proposals are put before the  Executive. At present, we have not received proposals. If the Executive accept  proposals, they will be discussed in the House.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: In  his answer to Ms Lo, the First Minister indicated how complex the issue is.  Will he assure Members that the views of the Assembly will be taken into account  before any decision is taken on this important issue?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Absolutely. There must be a proper debate that brings together  all sides to hear their views. Members must then fight for consensus, and, in  the end, I trust that that is the way in which a decision will be taken. There  will then be a Bill before the House that will encourage Members to achieve the  objectives that they have in mind.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Civic Forum</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr P  Ramsey </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister  what progress had been made on the restoration of the Civic Forum, and to  produce a detailed timetable and action plan.&nbsp; (AQO  8/08)</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Deputy First Minister and I are agreed on the importance of  continuing to seek the views of civil  society in developing policy. However, the previous Civic Forum had many  critics, and, as the nature of civil society has changed over the past five  years, we have decided to undertake a fundamental review to consider the most  appropriate mechanism and arrangements for engaging with civil society. We have written to the former members of the Civic  Forum to ascertain their views on reconvening the Civic Forum while the  review is being carried out. We are also consulting on the terms of reference  for the review process with the Committee for the Office of the First Minister  and the Deputy First Minister. The review will progress as quickly as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  The SDLP welcomes the First Minister&rsquo;s commitment to continue with the Civic  Forum. Almost 50% of those who were previously involved in the Civic Forum wish  to be part of it again. They wish to help and advise Members on a range of  cultural, social and economic matters. Under a review, why can we not have the  Civic Forum reconstituted in operational terms?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Member should not misunderstand me. I did not say that we  will have a Civic Forum. I said that we will consider the matter and suggest  proposals. It is now accepted that the previous Civic Forum was not  representative of society in Northern    Ireland. I am sure that the hon Member would  wish it to be representative of all sections of the community. That situation  must be remedied, and Members know that everyone must fight for their place on  it. In the previous Civic Forum, its members represented  only three facets of life in Northern    Irela<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; ">nd</span>.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Other people did not have any representation at all. Those  matters must be dealt with if we are to have a Civic Forum &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Sorry to interrupt, but Question Time is over for the Office of the First  Minister and the Deputy First Minister.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="6"></a>Agriculture and Rural Development</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Renewable Energy</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Molloy </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development what steps she has taken to increase the use of  renewable energies within the agrifood and rural communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=5/08>(AQO 5/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I refer my colleague to the  renewable energy action plan launched by my Department on 29 January  2007. That action plan, which was produced after  comprehensive consultation, focuses on promoting opportunities afforded  by the sustainable development of renewable  energy in the agrifood and forestry sectors and in the wider rural  economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Key actions in the plan  include support for profitable energy production, supply-chain  development, forestry products and by-products, use of agricultural waste for  energy production, deployment of renewable energy technologies within the wider  economy and energy efficiency. To ensure successful implementation of the action plan, work has begun to set up renewable  energy policy unit in the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development (DARD). That unit will promote active, effective and inclusive  engagement with stakeholder interests.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To highlight opportunities presented by renewable energy  technologies to the land-based sector and to raise awareness of energy  efficiency, the College   of Agriculture, Food and  Rural Enterprise (CAFRE), in conjunction with stakeholders, hosted a renewable-energy  industry open day in August. That successful event provided invaluable  information to more than 500 individuals, mainly representatives of the farming  and wider rural community.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her detailed report.  What new assistance will DARD make available to the rural community for  development of renewable energy projects and to help people get on board with  the development of the industry, as has been seen throughout Europe?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>: Go raibh maith agat. As the Member has pointed out, this is a  fast-developing opportunity for farmers. Axis 1 and Axis 3 of the &lsquo;Northern Ireland  Rural Development Programme 2007-2013&rsquo; include measures aimed at supporting renewable energy projects and  energy-efficiency technologies. In particular, funding will be available for  the establishment of further willow coppice, as well as support for market  development of the end product.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is proposing to establish an energy from  agrifood waste challenge fund, co-financed under the EU Structural Funds  Competitiveness Programme to encourage the livestock and food-processing  sectors to develop a range of sustainable technologies that will utilise  manures and food-processing waste to produce renewable energy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department plans to spend &pound;10 million over four years  to support that programme, which is due to commence in 2008. Detailed  information on all those measures is being developed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Minister give details of any initiatives or incentives that she and  her ministerial colleagues plan to bring  forward for the use of renewable energy, especially in rural schools and  businesses?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Since 2003, DARD has committed &pound;4 million in grant assistance to a range of  renewable energy projects and technologies,  including short-rotation willow coppice, across the North. In 2004,  DARD&rsquo;s Forest Service established a three-year challenge fund to encourage  landowners to establish willow coppice for  energy production. Under that scheme, 950 hectares of willow coppice  were established, or approved for establishment, by 45 rural businesses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The aid for energy crops scheme provides support of &euro;45 a hectare to growers of energy crops in the  North. As a keen advocate of renewable energy, I will work closely with  my Executive colleagues, including the Minister  of the Environment, to examine ways in which we can expand new opportunities. However, technically, aid for  schools is outside my remit.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Why is DARD proposing to spend millions of pounds on the regeneration of ex-military  bases and on providing childcare places and  programmes for children and young people? Does the Minister not agree  that her Department ought to be helping farmers, who are under immense  financial pressure?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  That question is not technically about renewable energy. However, the fact that  the Department is called the Department for Agriculture and Rural Development  points to the need for rural development and further schemes. We are looking at  huge challenges, particularly in the red-meat, pig and poultry sectors.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Where I can help to develop new opportunities for farmers  who want to consider other ways of using their land, it is incumbent upon me to  do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There has long been a belief in rural areas that the need  for childcare has been overlooked. It would be a great help to farming  families, as well as to the wider rural economy and community, if provision of  rural childcare were improved. I will work with ministerial colleagues in the  Department of Education and in the Department for Social Development to find  ways of enabling people &mdash; and women in particular &mdash; to become part of the  workforce if they choose and to train to become more involved in society. That  is enormously important to the rural community and economy. As Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development, it is my job to enable them to do so.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Planning Problems</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Dallat </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development what  discussions she has had with the Minister of the Environment in relation to  planning problems experienced by people involved in rural diversification  businesses; and in relation to the introduction  of appropriate changes to planning policies.&nbsp; <a name=12/08>(AQO 12/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I understand that some people involved in rural diversification  businesses have experienced problems with the rural development programme. I  appreciate that those applications must be considered in the context of  relevant planning policies and procedures. My officials continue to work with  the Planning Service to ensure that those responsible expedite consideration of  applications, especially where businesses are reliant upon planning permission  to avail of grant aid.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An interdepartmental group has been established by the  Executive to develop a revised rural planning policy. I will ensure that rural  economic development is fully considered as part of that review.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her reply. Her colleague Mrs Foster, the Minister of the  Environment has written a &ldquo;Dear John&rdquo; letter, telling me that all decisions are  made under current planning policies. Given that reply, will the Minister of  Agriculture tell the Minister of the Environment in no uncertain terms that the  criteria for establishing businesses in rural areas are hopelessly out of date?  Will she fight the corner for rural people; stop their being criminalised by  enforcement officers; encourage changes that are essential, given the decline  in agriculture; and then report to the Assembly?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I will fight the corner for rural businesses, for rural people who wish to  diversify and for farmers who wish to diversify into other projects. There is  much to be done.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the new dispensation, where members of the Executive work well together, I will co-operate  with my colleague in the Department  of the Environment to find the best way forward for rural businesses,  particularly the economic opportunities available to them. I am vexed when I  hear of projects that fail because time constraints on grant aid have been  exceeded as a result of planning problems. I am considering that issue, and  will work with ministerial colleagues to resolve it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  The Minister can do something about the criteria used for on-site planning  applications where a farmer needs a second home for a member of his family or  for a farm worker. Those criteria are assessed directly by the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What plans does the Minister have to change an outdated  system that causes heartache for many young families in the Province?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  The farm viability criteria to which the Member refers are implemented only as  part of wider planning policy. A farm dwelling, or second farm home, may fall  under restrictions such as ribbon or green-belt development or lack of  integration; it does not fail on the farm viability criteria alone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I discussed farm viability criteria recently with  officials, and asked whether they are necessary. I want the interdepartmental  working group to discuss them. The Planning Service has worked closely with my  Department, particularly on the farm nutrient manage&shy;ment scheme. In that respect, it was able to relax aspects of  planning policy that govern the building of slurry tanks. The Assembly has  expressed concerns about that in the past,  and my Department has worked with officials in the Department of the  Environment to eradicate difficulties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department will examine all of the issues of rural  planning, whether they are domestic, or business, farm buildings or slurry  tanks. We will work hard to make sure that the transition towards getting  planning permission is as smooth, seamless and pain-free as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Everyone in the Chamber is aware of the  recent landmark judicial decision in regard to PPS 14, and welcomes it.  Has the Minister had any discussions with the Minster of the Environment, Mrs  Foster, with special reference to the recent repeal of PPS 14, and have they  taken into account the effects that that will have  on the applications for diversification and planning matters for the  rural community?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Gabh mo leithsc&eacute;al. I hope that the Member will appreciate that, so far, the  morning has been busy, and will forgive me for not having had the time to  discuss the issue with the Minister of the Environment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am very concerned about the issue for two reasons. First,  we need to see an understanding of the needs of rural communities. PPS 14 was  draconian, and did not suit the needs of rural communities, and had a real  potential to disintegrate rural communities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, we still need to be balanced and measured in  planning policy. We have something special in the North, and we want planning policies that enable visitors and  local people to enjoy our countryside. We must be careful that we do not go too  far in the next round, and that, through the interdepartmental working group,  we find a balanced approach to rural  planning commensurate with the needs of the area. There are different  needs for strategies and adjustments where rural planning is needed, and also  care and consideration where there may have been too much planning in the past.  We will try to find a balanced approach, where we protect the countryside, as  well as keeping it a living, breathing and working entity.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Local Farm Produce</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Burnside </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development what  discussions she has had with the major supermarket chains in Northern Ireland  in relation to giving priority to the stocking and selling of local farm  produce.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=39/08>(AQO 39/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  A Cheann Comhairle. The multiple retailers  are major markets for food and drink produced in the North, and I have  made it a priority to engage with them to discuss their policies for local  sourcing and promotion of local produce. In June I met senior representatives of two of the major retailers, and  plan to meet others in the coming  months. During the meetings I encouraged the retailers to support the  sustainability of local supplies chains, and to take account of rising input  costs faced by producers and processors, and I encouraged them to increase the  amount of produce sourced from the North for their stores, both locally and in Britain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, I have just issued a letter to all of the local  supermarkets, seeking their views on the increase in the price of feed and  expressing my concern about the potential knock-on effects on producer margins.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am committed to helping farmers develop strong and  profitable relationships with their supply-chain partners and my Department has  been proactively facilitating such communication through the supply-chain  awareness programme for the past four years. We  are also providing facilitation and support to groups of producers  exploring market-focused initiatives.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. I will  preface my supplementary question with a comment about a sector in the  food supply chain that is often forgotten: the local butcher. The loyalty of  the public in going to the local butcher is something that has been retained in  the Province. For example, in Ballymoney there are six or seven butchers, where  people go to buy local produce. Whatever we do in the retail sector, we must  never forget the importance to the local farming economy of the local butcher.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I move to my supplementary question. Is it not preferable  to have a structured relationship with Sainsbury&rsquo;s, Tesco, and the other retail  chains where they may be obliged on a twice-yearly basis to submit the supply  of local produce that they put on their shelves, and, as a low-pricing policy  can be bad for local producers, to comment on their pricing policy?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I suggest that the Minister and her Department should  consider setting up a structure with the major retail chains like Sainsbury&rsquo;s,  Tesco, and the smaller ones, where they have to submit biannually to the  Department the amount of local produce stocked, so that the general public is  informed and can help the producers by buying at good farmgate prices.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I thank Mr Burnside for his supple&shy;mentary question. He is right in his  comments about butchers. Members all know butchers who are proud of the fact  that they seek the best local produce to sell in their shops. It is important  that that part of the supply chain is retained.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is outside my remit to tell supermarkets what to do. I  am not in a position to enforce price structures on them. However, I will  continue to work on behalf of the industry with supermarkets, producers and  retailers to try to ensure a better deal  for farmers. My Department wants supermarkets to stock local produce. In  my discussions with them, they tell me that that is often a response to the  consumer, who wants to be able to purchase local produce.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At present, much can be done by my Department in the way of  education and promotion. However, EU rules are changing. My Department will not  have the same flexibility in one or two years&rsquo; time, but it is often consumer  demand that leads to the promotion of local produce. The Department will  continue to work with all parts of the supply chain. Supermarkets are an important part in that given the amount of local  produce that they sell. They are keen on the idea of contracts, whereby  a farmer buys into a contract for a set period and will, therefore, know what price he will get. Although they  are a good idea, contracts must reflect outside variables, such as the price of  feed, for example, which has been a topical subject in today&rsquo;s debate and is  likely to be again. Contracts must be able to reflect outside variables that might not necessarily be apparent one or  two years in advance. The Department wants to work with supermarkets to ensure  the position of everyone in the supply chain.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  The Minister has touched on my question in her last comments. In discussions  about supermarkets with farmers in my area, they have told me that they believe  that supermarkets operate a cartel when contracting and purchasing. Does the  Minister share that view?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Mr Bradley is aware that I could not possibly comment on such a claim. My  personal thoughts and feelings do not come into the matter. I am the Minister  of Agriculture and Rural Development. I must, therefore, do my best to ensure  the supply of good, local food to wherever  it can be sold. Supermarkets are an important link in that chain. My  Department wants to maintain a good working relationship with them. To fire  insults at them in the Assembly will not help me to do that. I will certainly  do all that I can to improve the producer&rsquo;s part in the development of the  supply chain.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Agrienvironment Schemes</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to detail the number of farmers that are  participating in agrienvironment schemes in Northern Ireland; and the number  that have not been able to participate in the last two financial years, due to  lack of funding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=66/08>(AQO 66/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Agrienvironment schemes include the environmentally sensitive areas (ESA)  scheme and the countryside management scheme (CMS). In April 2007, the numbers of ESA and CMS scheme participants  were 4,318 and 8,858 respectively, which is a total of 13,176. The rural  development plan for 2000-06&rsquo;s agrienvironment programme expired on 31 December  2006. All eligible applications were processed and, subsequently, all  agrienvironment scheme agreements were issued to applicants by 31 December  2006. No one was excluded due to lack of funding. No further applications for  agrienvironment schemes will be accepted until the new scheme opens under the  current rural development plan 2007-13.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. Given the importance of maintaining and  expanding a good, clean, green environment in Northern Ireland, and efforts to  attract both tourists and inward investors, will the Minister ensure that there  will be sufficient funding in the future for whatever new schemes that come  along, bearing in mind the objective that the Assembly wants to reach?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I absolutely agree with the Member. I have seen great examples of the schemes,  such as when I spent a day in the Mournes. I am keen on the agrienviron&shy;ment  schemes and appreciate the work that they do  to enhance the local countryside. I want funding to go to those schemes and as many farmers as possible to take them up. I will ensure that the Department  works closely with farmers in a co-operative manner in order to get the best out of the land and to enhance biodiversity  and the rural environment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am enthusiastic about agrienvironment schemes, and I hope  that they continue long into the future.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Grain Prices</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Dr W  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development what steps  she is taking to help to protect the intensive livestock sector from increased  grain prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=51/08>(AQO 51/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I acknowledge that there has been a significant  rise in grain prices. That is primarily the result of adverse weather  conditions in Europe, increasing biofuel production and rising demand for  cereals, particularly in Asia. It is a  critical issue for our local producers, and they cannot be expected to continue  to make losses against the massive, and increasing, input cost. They are in a  precarious situation and fear for their future, and I am extremely worried  about that. I have called for an open discussion among producers, processors  and retailers to see what can be done to reflect better, in retail prices,  those increasing costs that jeopardise the entire supply chain.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  Members recognise the global increase in the price of grain and the serious  problem that it poses for the intensive livestock industry in Northern Ireland.  Can the Minister take urgent steps to protect the farming industry by making  representations to the processors and retailers to ensure an increase in  farmgate prices, because the present financial reward to farmers is  unacceptable? Farmers cannot be expected to produce an excellent product for a  price that is below production costs. That situation cannot continue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I agree. That work has already started and will continue. It is a challenging  time for the industry. We will not feel the effects of some of the changes that  the Department has already brought in &mdash; for example, the set-aside legislation  &mdash; until next year. I am concerned about  that, given that many people in the industry have already bought their  grains at a fixed rate. I am hugely worried about the impact that next year&rsquo;s  costs will have on the industry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am also working particularly closely with the pork  sector, because it will be the first to feel the impact; I am also working with  other sectors, such as the poultry sector. The rise in grain prices will have a  detrimental impact on the industry, and  prices will rise very shortly. Last week, I warned that if the price of  food does not rise to reflect the Member&rsquo;s  comment about the farming industry, producers could go out of business,  and there could be food shortages. I do not want that to happen. We need a fair  price for a product that has been born or grown here. I want farmers to get a  better price for their products.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  What level of increase in grain prices, over what period of time, would be  required before the Minister would introduce protective measures to ensure the  continuing success of our meat and dairy farming sectors?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>: I am not sure what protective factors the Member is referring  to. I will work closely with stakeholders  and with the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development on how to tackle  those challenges. I am very concerned about the increase in costs. The price of  grain has almost doubled in one year, and that is having a knock-on effect,  given the number of food products that rely on maize, corn, barley or oats.  There will be an increase in prices. We will work, at every level, to try to  help the industry as much as we can.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  Does the Minister appreciate the urgent  need to help those people who remain in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s pig industry &mdash; the fourth-largest industry in the  food sector? In the past few days, 18 producers have moved out of pig  production. The Minister said that she was fighting to help rural businesses  and that she was distressed  when they failed. However, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s pig industry is failing. Pig farmers are in a  similarly dire situation in Germany,  where it costs &pound;21 to produce a pig and &pound;24 to produce a weaner; there, farmers are given a subsidy of &pound;17 per pig by the  German Government. Those farmers are still gassing pigs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Does the Minister want that to become the picture  in Northern Ireland?  She found over &pound;3 million of funding for potato growers who found themselves in  circumstances beyond their control. Will the Minister consider doing likewise  for the pig industry in Northern    Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I take it that the Member has a supplementary question?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I heard several anyway. <em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I do not have the details of that, but I will look into it. There are rules  around intervention, so I would like to see how Germany got around that. Generally,  the Government do not get involved in the determination of farm-gate prices &mdash;  that is a matter for the parties concerned. As I have already said, I will work  very hard with all aspects of the supply chain to ensure that we get a fair  price for farmers. I assure the Member that the challenges that face the pork  sector are of particular concern to me.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Will you answer the question?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  What was the question? <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Fishing Industry</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr W  Clarke </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to detail  her plans for the December Council negotiations in Europe on Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  fishing industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=129/08>(AQO 129/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. It is clear that the main  issue this year is likely to be the further restriction on fishing effort. I  wish to ensure that our vessels have sufficient fishing days at sea to catch  their quotas. As part of the review of the cod recovery plan, the European  Commission is likely to propose new measures for controlling fishing effort during 2008, and there is a strong case for no significant  changes to current effort control arrangements this December.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to fish quotas, we await publication of the  main scientific evidence advice on Irish Sea  fish stocks in October. We will discuss the implications of that advice in  detail with the industry. However, I want to ensure that the significant  increase in prawn quotas that was secured last year is retained and that the  proposed reduction in the herring quota is reversed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The industry has also made it clear that an increase in the  haddock quota is urgently needed, and we will work closely with Agri-Food and  Biosciences Institute (AFBI) scientists and the industry to see if a case can  be developed to persuade the Commission. Meetings have already been held with  our fishing industry representatives to identify their main issues of concern  for this December&rsquo;s Fisheries Council, and there will be further consultations  as more proposals emerge from the Commission. I will also meet my counterparts  in the other devolved Administrations and in the South to agree a common  approach, as far as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  A Cheann Comhairle. Many of the scientific assessments for various sea fish  stocks are contradictory. What is the Minister doing to address that so that  quotas can be increased?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I agree &mdash; without proper scientific data, we often get uncertain assessments,  which, in turn, lead to precautionary advice to reduce quotas. Therefore,  improving the supply of data available to the Commission&rsquo;s fisheries scientists  is to our benefit and to the benefit of the industry. That will require close  co-operation between official scientists and fishermen, which I fully support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In June this year, the Commission approved the Irish Sea data enhancement pilot project, which  involves scientists and fishermen from North and South of the island, as well as from England,  collaborating to produce additional catch-and-discard data to allow  better stock assessments to be made. Participating fishermen will receive  additional days at sea in return for their efforts, and I fully support the  retention of that scheme this December. Such  collaborative projects are very welcome, but it is also vital that there  is full participation in statutory data collection programmes if we are to  develop robust cases for quota increases that will influence the Commission&rsquo;s  advisers and give me a strong basis on which to make my arguments at the coming  Fisheries Council.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Caseous Lymphadenitis</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mr  Kennedy </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and  Rural Development what plans she has to introduce a slaughter policy and  compensation scheme for caseous lymphadenitis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=37/08>(AQO  37/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I have no plans to introduce a slaughter policy and compensation scheme for  sheep and goats affected by caseous lymphadenitis (CLA). Following a review of  the CLA situation in 2004, such a policy was discontinued as it was unlikely,  owing to the nature of the disease and the lack of a reliable test, that CLA  could be effectively controlled or eradicated from our flocks. That continues  to be the position, which means that a slaughter-and-compensation scheme is  not, at this time, an effective way of dealing with the disease.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her reply. She will be aware of the serious economic  damage that an outbreak of CLA can inflict  on the already precarious livelihoods of sheep farmers. Why should the  principle of a slaughter-and-compensation policy, which underpins other major  diseases, not be extended to this significant area?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  My Department&rsquo;s current veterinary assessment is that a slaughter policy would  not be an effective way of dealing with CLA. The disease has already spread and established itself within the  domestic flock, although the extent of the spread is difficult to  quantify due to the insidious nature of the disease. Another key factor is that there is no reliable individual test  for CLA, so replacement animals may not be free of the disease, and it is also  not possible to ensure that imported animals are free of the disease. It would therefore not be possible to eradicate the  disease through a testing and slaughter programme.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">National Lottery Funding</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure what are his plans  to address the shortfall in funding, in light of the recent decision by the  National Lottery to redirect &pound;42 million from Northern Ireland&rsquo;s grant, and  channel it towards the Olympic Games in 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=45/08>(AQO  45/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">16. <strong>Mr K  Robinson </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure what steps he is  taking to offset the impact on arts and community groups of the reduction in  National Lottery funding, due to its redirection to support 2012 London Olympic  Games projects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=33/08>(AQO 33/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr Poots)</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I  will take questions 1 and 16 together. The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure  is making bids for funding as part of the comprehensive spending review 2008-11  to support the development of sport and the arts. Those bids will take account  of reductions in funding resulting from prioritisation of lottery spending on  the London Olympics.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is also making bids for funding for sport  and the arts under the investment strategy for Northern Ireland 2008-18. The  Olympics will also provide some further funding opportunities for cultural  projects associated with the Cultural Olympiad. I will be keen to see arts  organisations engage with those opportunities when they arise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to community groups, the Big Lottery Fund has  made a public commitment that, providing forecasted lottery income is  maintained, current programmes for community groups will not be materially  affected by the diversion of funds to the Olympics. The Big Lottery Fund  advises that its undertaking to provide 60% to 70% of its funding to the voluntary and community sectors will be unaffected.  That will mean that the Big Lottery Fund will invest a minimum of &pound;60 million in the voluntary and community sectors  between 2006 and 2009.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has  recently confirmed that an agreement has been reached with the Mayor of London  under which DCMS should, in time, be able to refund the &pound;675 million additional contribution to the lottery  distributors. It is hoped that that will come from the proceeds of the  sale of Olympic Park land post-2012.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>: May I say to the Minister that making bids at this time is no  guarantee; nor are hopes useful. Bearing in  mind that the loss of jobs will be horrendous, is this not another case  of the UK Government sacrificing the interests of the regions to placate those  of the south-east of England?  The voluntary sector is suffering from a shortfall of &pound;28&middot;70 million; the built  heritage sector is &pound;4&middot;83 million short of its usual allocation, while the Arts  Council and Sport Northern Ireland are &pound;4&middot;50 million and &pound;4&middot;10 million short  respectively. The Minister knows that all of those organisations are already  grossly underfunded. What steps is the  Minister taking to work with other devolved Administrations to ensure  that a similar situation cannot occur in the future in Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: In  the first instance, all the devolved Administrations stated that they were  opposed to the move at the outset, and sought to reduce the amount of money  that would go to the London Olympics from those sources at this time. We will  vigorously oppose any further leakage of money from Northern Ireland. However, we must  concentrate on what we can do now, which  is, within our own block budget, to identify how the arts, sport and  cultural pursuits can benefit the Northern Ireland community and its economy,  and to seek to raise funding for those facilities.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Will the Minister state which Olympic events, if any, he intends to try to  bring to Northern Ireland?  Has he made an assessment of how much income those events could potentially  generate to offset the loss of any lottery funding?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  There are a limited number of Olympic events that could be brought to Northern Ireland.  We have been informed that if we had a stadium that was fit for purpose, we  could potentially get three Olympic football matches. However, there are other  opportunities associated with the Olympics; in particular, athletes wishing to  acclimatise in the UK could come to Northern Ireland and enjoy the training  facilities that will be available.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As part of that, DCAL has set aside money in the investment  strategy for Northern Ireland (ISNI) to develop elite facilities. A range of  facilities will be developed for those Olympians to come and participate in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  To what extent has funding to Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael, the GAA, been affected  and can the Minister provide some detail on the bids that have been made to  address the shortfall?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  am not aware that any bids by the GAA have been affected by what has taken  place thus far. The Department has dealt with applications as they have come  in. Those and future applications will be dealt with after the completion of  the 2008-11 comprehensive spending review. DCAL will be able to make decisions  based on the outcome of the Northern Ireland Budget.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Irish and Ulster Scots: Funding and Parity</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Campbell </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure what steps he is  taking to (a) establish the overall levels of departmental funding for the  Irish language and the Ulster-Scots  cultural outlook in recent years; and (b) introduce measures to ensure  parity exists for each.&nbsp; <a name=78/08>(AQO 78/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: My  Department collates annual returns from all Northern Ireland Civil Service  departments and the NIO on the linguistic diversity projects. That includes  capital and resource funding for Irish-medium education, funding in  Ulster-Scots language, heritage and culture and Irish language projects,  programmes, supported organisations and  translations. In the 2006-07 financial year, the provisional funding  figures for Irish language activities amounted to &pound;17,064,000, with &pound;639,000  for Ulster Scots. Funding to the North/South Language Body by my Department for  2007 will be &pound;3&middot;43 million, with &pound;1&middot;879  million for Foras na Gaeilge and the  Ulster-Scots Agency respectively. The Northern Ireland Executive are  committed to affording equal respect and recognition to the Ulster-Scots and  Irish languages and to supporting the development of their respective cultural  traditions. The funding provided to each  reflects the differing range of projects, programmes and supported  organisations.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Were I a satirist, I might begin my question to the Minister with the words,  &ldquo;Cora my Yogi Bear, a can coca colya.&rdquo;  However, setting humour to one side, the information provided by the  Minister confirms what I established from  the direct rule Minister last year &mdash; that the Irish language obtains 30  times more public funding than the Ulster-Scots cultural outlook. Given that  that is the case, will the Minister confirm  that the figures he has outlined to the Assembly today will be taken into account when he is deliberating on  future budget allocations on the basis of parity for all of the people with a  cultural outlook in Northern    Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Funding for Irish and Ulster Scots is a cross-departmental matter. One of the  issues is that almost &pound;12 million is spent by the Department of Education on those matters. It is up to the  Assembly and the relevant Committees to identify the appropriateness of  that level of spending. I will take on board the issues that affect my  Department but I ask Members to recognise that the current situation and  circumstances are a result of decisions made by direct rule Ministers. There  are people outside the House who said they wanted more of that type of  activity. I want to equalise things and take them forward in a more balanced  way. That is why we are in the House and that is why I am at this Table. I want  a more equitable situation in Northern    Ireland; others outside the House would  prefer discrimination to continue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  ask the Minister to take into consideration, when he looks at the matter, the  most recent census figures, which show that around 10% of the population of Northern Ireland  speak the Irish language and only 2% speak Ulster Scots. I hope that those  figures will be reflected in the allocation of resources.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: My  Department must consider the value of the census. I could probably claim that I  speak Irish because I can say a few words, but that does not make me a fluent  Irish speaker. I am interested to know how many of those 10% could read and  understand a document sent to them in Irish. If those people did not also  receive a version in English, I wonder whether it would prevent them from  acting as they had intended. That figure would better reflect the true need.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Irish Language Bill</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Brolly </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to outline the  timescale for the publication of the second consultation on an Irish language  Bill. <a name=126/08>(AQO 126/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  Storey </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure whether he would  give an update on his Department&rsquo;s current  position on an Irish language Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=86/08>(AQO  86/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  think that the Member said, &ldquo;Question 3&rdquo;. I am pretty sharp today, Mr Speaker.  With your permission, I shall answer questions 3 and 6 together.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The consultation on the indicative draft clauses of the  Irish language legislation closed on 5 June 2007. Over 70% of the 11,000 responses have been processed to date,  and I intend to make a statement to the House in the early autumn.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>: I  do not accept that the rights of Irish speakers should be subject to  consultation. A right is a right. Does the Minister believe that recognising in  law the rights of Irish speakers is a positive demonstration of respect for the  rights of others? Does he agree that the Irish language and the right to speak  Irish threaten no one and that it is not  compulsory? Does the Minister agree that the Irish language is not the  property of any one section of our people but belongs to everyone?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  totally agree with the Member that the Irish language is not compulsory and  should not become so. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  Detailed, agreed provision for the development of the Irish language was  contained in the Belfast Agreement and subsequently implemented by the former  Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, my colleague Michael McGimpsey.  Therefore, does the Minister agree that the discussion on timetabling would be  irrelevant had he and his party not agreed to an unnecessary Irish language Act  at St Andrews?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  think that Mr McFarland was at St Andrews. The DUP  has never agreed to an Irish language Act &mdash; not before St Andrews, not  at St Andrews and not since St Andrews.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>: The campaign for an Irish language Act has been framed and  fronted by Sinn F&eacute;in. That has turned the Irish language into a cultural  weapon. As Sinn F&eacute;in states in one of its publications, it is:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;another bullet in the freedom struggle&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree  that a divisive Irish language Act should be avoided and that the  Assembly should instead seek to develop language through a coherent strategy  for the Irish language in keeping with the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Charter for  Regional or Minority Languages?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I have had the privilege of meeting people from a Gaelic  background, including some from a Scots Gaelic background, who happened to be  mostly Scottish Presbyterians. Indeed, over 100 years ago, the Irish language  was more commonly spoken by those of Presbyterian origin. In recent years,  efforts to promote the Irish language that were associated with political  movements have not helped it to move forward on a cross-community basis.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Significant steps have already been taken as part of the  strategy to enhance, develop and protect the Irish language through the Council  of Europe&rsquo;s Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The Irish language is  recognised under part III of the charter, which details the 36 provisions that the UK  Government have applied solely to Irish in Northern Ireland. Much of the work  on those provisions was done as a consequence of the work of the previous  Administration, particularly the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, Mr  McGimpsey. Therefore, the process of enhancing, developing and protecting the  Irish language has been going on for a long time in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Ulster  Grand Prix and Motorcycling</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Burnside </strong>asked the Minster of Culture, Arts and Leisure to make a statement  on the success of the 2007 Ulster Grand Prix week and to outline his plans to  support the Ulster Grand Prix in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=32/08>(AQO  32/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">10. <strong>Mr  Hamilton </strong>asked the Minster of Culture, Arts and Leisure what steps he  intends to take to ensure the continued development of the sport of motorcycling  in Northern Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=71/08>(AQO 71/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will take questions 4 and 10 together.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was pleased to witness the success of this year&rsquo;s Ulster  Grand Prix at first hand. I would like to take the opportunity to offer my  congratulations to all those who offered support, including the Member, and  were involved in the organisation of the week-long event.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Future support for the Ulster Grand Prix is a matter for  the umbrella body for motor sport, the 2&amp;4 Wheel Motor Sport Steering Group  Ltd. This year, the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure made an additional  &pound;150,000 available to the 2&amp;4 Wheel Motor Sport Steering Group, of which  &pound;100,000 was used to purchase safety equipment, which is available for use by  the event organisers. In addition, Sport Northern Ireland is currently  assisting the 2&amp;4 Wheel Motor Sport Steering Group with the preparation of a business case setting out future  funding requirements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Responsibility for the development of the sport of motorcycling  in Northern Ireland  rests with the Motorcycle Union of Ireland (Ulster Centre), as represented by  the 2&amp;4 Wheel Motor Sport Steering Group. I recently had discussions with  the Motorcycle Union of Ireland and the Dundrod club, and they will get back to  me shortly with proposals for developing the sport.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  I thank the Minister for that and join with him in congratulating the  organisers of the Ulster Grand Prix, which took place in the most atrocious  conditions in the almost 100-year-old history of the race. The organisers and  unpaid marshals managed to get water off the course and the race going. I thank  the main sponsors &mdash; the independent newspapers and the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; &mdash;  for a tremendous promotional event.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Minister, there are three great international road races  left in the world: the North West 200; the TT,  which is unique to the Isle of Man; and the  Ulster Grand Prix. Two of these are Northern Irish. The North West 200 has become a  family-orientated, Province-wide tourist attraction. The TT is unique. The  Ulster Grand Prix is constantly being  squeezed and has little financial backing. I ask the Minister to make a  special case for the Ulster Grand Prix in his discussions with the organisers  and the 2&amp;4 Wheel Motor Sport Steering Group because the race must be  retained for the Province and this sport.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The first issue of road racing is the safety of  riders; that must be paramount. Spending and funding should be dedicated  to safety first. The second issue is the success of the event. The race itself  is spectacular, and we receive support for  marketing, corporate branding and maximising corporate hospitality.  There are lots of opportunities for the Ulster Grand Prix to progress. Not all  of it is related to funding; it is also about how we can assist in developing  the professional capacity of the Ulster Grand Prix. Work should commence on road racing in Northern   Ireland to ensure that it continues to grow and  thrive and bring its benefits to tourism and economic development in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>: We all value the excellent contribution made to the sport by  individual motorcycling clubs. Does the Minister agree that if we are to  continue to progress the sport and maximise the opportunities provided by  motorcycling, a strategic co-ordinated approach is important?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  think the Member is right, and it is as easy to market several of the races as  it is to market one, so we can concentrate  resources together and make savings. It is the same with some of the  management aspects. We need to look at a more strategic approach to road racing. The clubs that organise it do a  tremendous job, but many of these people are volunteers, and if we can help them to develop a more professional approach,  it will assist in the growth of the sport.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">All-Ireland Velodrome</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr W  Clarke </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure what steps he is  taking to assess the potential development of an all-Ireland cycling velodrome  based in Newcastle, County Down, or in Belfast.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=119/08>(AQO  119/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Sport Northern Ireland  is currently managing an elite facilities capital programme on behalf of the  Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure. On Wednesday 5 September I announced  that 15 of the 27 applications received by Sport Northern Ireland and the  initial expression-of-interest competition had been assessed as suitable for  progression to stage 2.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Three of the applications relate to the potential  development of a velodrome, and the proposed sites include Newcastle,  Belfast and  Newry. A strategic outline business case is being prepared seeking budget  approval for the Elite Facilities Capital Programme, and, subject to approval  of the business case, the three velodrome applicants, along with the other  twelve, will be given three months to prepare an outline business case for their individual projects. Following  assessment of those business cases by Sport Northern Ireland, a  recommendation will be made to the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure. A  further selection process will then take place, and successful applicants from  the fifteen will be invited to proceed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  reply. What measures will he put in place to develop infrastructure for cycling,  including mountain biking?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The development of a velodrome, which would be hugely significant for cycling,  was identified as a priority in the ISNI bid for the development of elite  facilities. With regard to mountain biking and other aspects of cycling, my  Department recently wrote to the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development to open up discussion on the use of its facilities for cycling,  because we have some wonderful assets in Northern Ireland for such activity  and we would like to make full use of those resources.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  I welcome the fact that Belfast  is through to the next stage of the competition for the design of the  velodrome. The proposal for Belfast  is more innovative than the others, because the design is not only for a  cycling track but for a multi-purpose facility that can accommodate other  sports such as judo, boxing and table tennis. However, the question is: how  much money will be available for the Elite Facilities Capital Programme? The  site identified in east Belfast  would be the most cost effective, as much of the necessary infrastructure is  already in place.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  thank the Member for his bid. I am not sure whether he had anything to do with  filling in the application form, but I understand that it was well completed,  so perhaps he did have something to do with it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The velodrome will be  built in County Down,  because the proposed site in Belfast is also on the  County Down side of the city. Having said that, we will consider all the  applications and they will be judged fairly, on merit and on value for money.  Fifty-three million pounds has been set aside in the investment strategy to  deliver the velodrome, but that figure is  still to be finally negotiated with the Department of Finance and  Personnel. Ultimately, the swimming pool will be the first project to receive funding from ISNI, and North Down  Borough Council will work up a plan for the delivery of that project.  Those decisions will come further down the line.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 6 has been withdrawn.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Sports Coaches</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr P  Maskey </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure what steps he is  taking to increase the number of sports coaches.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=122/08>(AQO 122/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Sport Northern Ireland is  responsible for establishing the strategic development for coaching in Northern Ireland.  In that capacity, it has been involved in the development of &mdash; and has endorsed  &mdash; the UK coaching framework 2003-2017, a 3-7-11 action plan that sets out a  UK-wide plan for the development of coaching  over the next 10 years. Sport Northern    Ireland is also working with the  Irish Sports Council on the develop&shy;ment of a coaching strategy for Irish  sport. In addition, coaching has been identified as the key target area in the  new 10-year draft strategy for sport and physical recreation, which is being  developed by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in partnership with  Sport Northern Ireland. I hope to publish the draft strategy for consultation  in the near future.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  In the past few days, four young people have died while participating in sport.  Will the Minister make any provision for defibrillators in sporting facilities  and for training coaches to gain medical expertise?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  understand that defibrillators were available where both young boys died.  First, I express my personal regret at the death of the two boys, and extend my  condolences to their families. The Ulster secretary of the GAA, Danny  Murphy, has raised the issue of screening young people before participating in  sport, and that would have to be considered by the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety. Such a measure would have an additional cost, but  it would be money well spent. It is not for my Department to decide, but it is  a big issue that has touched communities across Northern Ireland. It is a tragedy  that we want to avoid in future.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Both the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure and, earlier, the First Minister  covered the issue that I had intended to raise.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Creative Media Industry Clusters</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mr P  Ramsey </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to outline his  strategies to provide creative media industry clusters in Northern Ireland.  &nbsp; <a name=15/08>(AQO 15/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  recognise the increasingly important contribution of the creative industries to  a modern, knowledge-based economy and to sustainable employ&shy;ment. In 2005, Northern Ireland  had more than 2,500 such enterprises employing 34,600 people &mdash; about 4&middot;7% of  total employment. My Department leads in the overarching strategy for creative  industries in conjunction with other  Departments and Invest Northern Ireland. I am bidding for a  creativity seed fund in the comprehensive spending review to assist emerging  businesses in the sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the Member&rsquo;s constituency, the Department funds The  Nerve Centre, which is based in a former shirt factory and which has developed  into a world-class creative hub providing  young people with opportunities to develop skills in creative media,  including music and digital media technologies. My Department has also been  working closely with Ilex to oversee the distribution of the north-west  cultural challenge fund to enhance the cultural infrastructure of the city of Londonderry further.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department also endorses the concept of the Cathedral  Quarter as a creative cluster in Belfast.  DCAL has provided funding for a new metropolitan arts centre and for the Black Box, and is also considering a  business case from Oh Yeah to establish a music hub in the Cathedral Quarter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department also supports the arts in that area to promote an environment in which creative entrepreneurs  can flourish. Northern Ireland Screen has a three-year licence to operate the  Paint Hall in the Titanic Quarter as a film studio, and plans to carry out a  study into the long-term viability of a creative cluster based around the Paint  Hall. My Department is working closely with Invest Northern Ireland, which  is developing a strategy for the growth of a digital content sector, which will  include the development of networks and clusters. My Department also supports  work by DETI, Invest Northern Ireland  and a special EU programmes body to develop a creative industries support  programme in which creative media will feature strongly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I thank the Minister for such a detailed breakdown of his ministerial  commitment to the issue. I suggest that the Minister visit the very successful  cluster of television production companies based in and around Connemara, County Galway.  Perhaps the Minister and his officials could go there to see the models of good  practice in creative industries.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  thank the Member for that suggestion. We in Northern Ireland have many  opportunities, but to develop them we need the support of the BBC and UTV, and  I would like them to step up to the mark. There is a great deal of film  production in Northern Ireland,  and I would like to see more productions for the television channels that are  associated with work in Northern    Ireland. Money has gone to such programmes  before, but, unfortunately, most of the filming has taken place in other  locations.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: Given the importance of the creative media industry in Northern Ireland, which, as the Minister said,  employs almost 5% of the total workforce, what plans does he have to assist its  expansion considering that traditional industries in Northern Ireland are continuing to  decline?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Creative industries are increasingly recognised for their growth potential and  for the contribution that they make to the national economy. As I said, their  contribution to the United    Kingdom economy equates to about 7% gross  value added, and they employ around two million people. The sector is growing  at twice the rate of the national economy and is  similar in size to the financial services sector. Cultural and creative  industries also bring wider social and economic benefits, and a thriving arts  scene acts as a catalyst for the development of tourism, inward investment and  regeneration. Furthermore, creativity and innovation are important drivers for  success in most industries.</p>

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I apologise for interrupting the Minister, but Question Time is up. We will  resume the debate on the economic development task force.</p>

	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Economic Development Task Force</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on amendment to motion:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Enterprise, Trade  and Investment to establish a task force to address urgently the economic  development of the west, including the areas covered by Fermanagh, Omagh,  Strabane, Dungannon and Cookstown District Councils; and further calls upon the  Minister to bring forward a report of the task force by 31<sup>st</sup> March  2008, to include specific recommendations to tackle neglect, increase  investment and maximise opportunities for North-South funding aimed at  improving infrastructure and achieving higher levels of employment and  employability in these areas. &mdash; <em>[Mr Gallagher.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Which amendment was:</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Leave out all after the first &ldquo;to&rdquo; and insert</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;investigate with relevant Ministers the economic  development of the west, including the areas covered by Fermanagh, Omagh,  Strabane, Cookstown, and Dungannon District Councils; and to ensure that these  matters, including infrastructure, employment and employability, are taken into  account in the discussions leading to the Programme for Government, Budget and  Comprehensive Spending Review.&rdquo; &mdash; <span style="font-style:normal; ">[Lord Morrow.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  Judging by Members&rsquo; comments, it is clear that all elected representatives  recognise the importance of the economy in taking Northern Ireland forward. Economic  prosperity is high on the agendas of all parties. We may differ on how best to  address the economy, but it has become a greater priority for all parties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I identify and sympathise with the problems that Mr  Gallagher mentioned, and I understand the issues that he raised. I share his  concerns. However, we differ in how those problems should be addressed.  Therefore, I support the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I could quote figures that would substantiate my call for a task force, but I will not approach the  debate in that way. Likewise, I could quote figures from areas in East  Belfast such as the Newtownards Road and Dee Street where there is an unemployment rate of 6&middot;3%, of whom 40% have  been categorised as long-term unemployed. The area around the Mountpottinger Road  and the Albertbridge Road  is the ninth most deprived area in Northern Ireland. It has an  unemployment rate of 9&middot;3%, of which almost 50% are long-term employed. I could  continue to quote figures that, for instance, illustrate that 17,000 people in  my constituency are regarded as having difficulty with reading and writing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Every Member who has spoken in the debate has stated that they want to see sound, sustainable  economic prosperity in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, as the motion  specifies. However, if Members are to address the problem overall, they must  remember that this is a small area with a  population of only 1&middot;7 million people. Within two hours or thereabouts,  one can drive to any part of Northern Ireland.  That suggests that an economic task force targeting one area would have  less of an impact than addressing the problem overall.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair" style="margin-top:6.4pt;margin-right:11.35pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:11.35pt;">(Mr Deputy Speaker  [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When Members are discussing creating a stronger economy  through the private sector and commercial manufacturing, I ask them to consider  the Varney Review. It would be of great benefit if Northern Ireland were to achieve a  corporate tax of 12&middot;5%, the feasibility of which Sir David Varney is examining.  I would prefer a corporate tax of 10% for Northern   Ireland so that we can separate ourselves from, and give  ourselves a slight advantage over, the Republic of Ireland.  However, a reduction in corporate tax alone could achieve a great deal in  economic growth and should be central to  any strategic and political planning.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I empathise with Mr Gallagher. He stated that improvements  in the economy will be brought about by investment in infrastructure, roads and  health. The Minister dealt adequately with that, in that it does require the  review of all the other Departments to produce a holistic policy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Lord Morrow focused on the issues, referring to WEST and  the fact that that is an ongoing area of work. He also referred to the need to  seek additional funding for tourism opportunities, but we do not necessarily  need a task force to tell us that. Indeed, Mr Molloy indicated that a new  approach to the west is needed. The figures that the Minister quoted were  revealing. I could argue that TSN is in fact a form of discrimination against  my constituency, in the sense that there is no TSN area in my constituency. It  has pockets of deprivation that are not being addressed. However, the Minister  was able to indicate that while the target is for 75% of investment to be in  TSN areas, 80% has been achieved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Cree concentrated his efforts on UK regional  policy. I agree with his comments on what Mike Smyth said about regional  policy, which might be identified in some ways as a task force, and is not  working &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  OK.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I remind Members that I made it very clear that the purpose of the motion was  not to divert resources away from anyone else&rsquo;s constituency or any other areas of disadvantage, but to draw attention  to the disadvantage in the west.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My thanks to all the Members who came into the Chamber and  took part in the debate. The Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment was present for all the debate. He said that it would  present difficulties for him if Members in other areas were to bring up similar  proposals, and he was not the only Member who raised that concern. The fact is  that no other area in Northern Ireland has suffered the effects of regional  imbalance as acutely as the west. There are specific disadvantages and past  neglects that set the west apart.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister did recognise some of the successes in the  west, as we all do. That success, and the growing reputation of some of our  companies, is due, in part at least, to good support from Invest Northern Ireland. That  support has been going to the local indigenous companies, which local people  rely on for jobs. INI support is well recognised. However, I do not accept the  Minister&rsquo;s claim that INI is bringing foreign investment to the west. That is  not happening &mdash; and that is not only my view; it is shared by other elected  representatives, and by people on the ground. Much more work needs to be done,  and there is a very strong view that that is part of INI&rsquo;s brief. The view is  that INI is performing very poorly when it comes to getting foreign investment to  come in through Belfast,  or wherever, and move into the west.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister  specifically mentioned the support given by Government agencies where  there is disadvantage. It is good to hear that, but he did not tell us how much  of that support for disadvantaged areas is going into the disadvantaged areas  in the west, for example, Fermanagh and South Tyrone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">The Member for East Londonderry, Gregory Campbe</span>ll, intervened  during the Minister&rsquo;s contribution. He said that assistance for disadvantaged  areas should not be based on geography and  that he opposed the motion. That is all right. However, the amendment  that he supports also refers to disadvantage  on the grounds of geography. I cannot  make any sense of Mr Campbell&rsquo;s intervention.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members spoke in favour of the motion. It is clear  from the issues that arose consistently &mdash; roads, decentralisation, inward  investment and health &mdash; what the important issues are for the west, and that  they must be addressed. Many Members commended the work of WEST, which comprises  the five councils. I also referred to the work of WEST in my initial  contribution, and it does very good work. However, that work needs focus and  cohesion, which must come from Departments. It should not come only from the  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, but from the co-ordination and  collaboration of almost all the Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank those Members who gave reasoned and persuasive  arguments supporting the motion. Dr Deeny, in addition to pointing out &mdash; quite  rightly &mdash; that the amendment is weak, raised the issue of health and the  concerns about hospitals in the west. If the debate has done one thing, it has  drawn attention to the concerns about the travel times of the people in the  west to hospitals, especially those in more rural areas. An air ambulance would  go a long way towards addressing concerns about the golden hour. There is  potential for expanding a helicopter repair business and associated activities  at Enniskillen (St Angelo) Airport &mdash; indeed, there is a compelling case for an  all-Ireland air ambulance based at Enniskillen. That is one example that would  have implications across several Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members  speaking in support of the amend&shy;ment referred to task forces. Members  seem to think that because there were task forces in the past, we should not have them any more, as they did not  achieve anything. Members are right: the task forces did not achieve anything, but they were not part of the Assembly.  No task force has been brought before the Assembly, which is working on behalf  of all the people on the basis of equality and addressing social need.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Under direct rule, many Members were involved in the work  of task forces for their councils, but that work was placed on a shelf and left  there. However, an Assembly task force, with specific recommendations, would  have accountability; we could see what our Departments and elected  representatives were doing, and the public could see what happens. A task  force, with specific recommendations, would be the best way to address economic  development in the west. It is not good enough to leave the work to the  Executive. The people on the street want to know what has changed since direct  rule; they want to know where the &pound;30 million needed to run the Assembly is  going and what the Executive are doing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If Members reject the motion, they will send out the  message that the issue will be dealt with somewhere in the heart of Government.  If we are around when the papers are released under the 30-year rule, we might  find out what went on in the Executive. Members have an opportunity to set out  a way forward for the west and to build on the work of elected representatives  from all the parties that have sat in local councils in the west and given  their stamp of approval to the new strategy for the west at council level.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, undertaking  the task involves collaboration and co-operation. How better can Members  show that they are taking the issue seriously and are co-operating on it than  by supporting the motion?</p>

	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Enterprise, Trade  and Investment to investigate with relevant Ministers the economic development of the west, including the areas  covered by Fermanagh, Omagh, Strabane, Cookstown, and Dungannon District  Councils; and to ensure that these matters,  including infrastructure, employment and employability, are taken into  account in the discussions leading to the Programme for Government, Budget and  Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="9"></a>Tax-Varying Powers</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to  propose and 10 minutes for the winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;That this Assembly supports the transfer of tax  varying powers to the Executive, along with the establishment of an Executive  borrowing facility.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It was heartening during the previous debate to hear the  consensus for a strong economy and particularly to hear the comments of the  Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This debate is also important and it will not end after the  vote is taken on the motion &mdash; it is too important. How we fund our policies  will be at the heart of many of the key matters that Members will discuss in  the coming days and weeks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The budgeting of the Programme for Government and the  setting of funding priorities will be the first tests of how we, as local  politicians, can make a difference in  education, health, housing and the economy. There are further key issues  such as water charges, the review of rating, the Varney Review, industrial  derating, and the use of public finance for public investment, all of which  will depend on our ability to utilise the available financial resources.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The debate on our level of fiscal freedom will be at the  heart of all those issues. The demand for tax-varying powers and an Executive  borrowing facility are important. We should have the confidence to take  responsibility for those matters.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The economic performance of the North of Ireland has been  and continues to be poor in comparison to the rest of Ireland, and Britain. It is not just political  instability, deep societal divisions and over 30 years of conflict that have  caused that situation &mdash; there are deep patterns of discrimination and  disadvantage, which have resulted in a lack  of economic development. The local economy is imbalanced in the relative  contributions of the public and private sectors to economic activity. Inward  investment is sluggish, and the growth of indigenous business is low.  Employment is concentrated in the service sector with low-paid, low-skilled and  low-security jobs. Those facts highlight the scale of the problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Public spending is responsible for 63% of our gross  domestic product. Economic output is approximately 20% below the British  average, and has also fallen behind the Twenty-six Counties. As was borne out  during the previous debate, the low employment figure of less than 5% conceals the fact that levels of economic  inactivity are far higher. The number of people on incapacity benefit is 74%  higher than the British average, and the fact that university graduates are  leaving in droves is contributing to a skills deficit.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, therefore, the tools with which to make a  difference are needed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The case for differential tax treatment in the North of  Ireland rests on the fact that existing policy measures are inadequate.  Although there is no doubt that the lowering of corporation tax is important to  the economy, and a level playing field on the island of Ireland would go a long  way towards attracting and sustaining foreign direct investment (FDI), more  must be done to deliver investment in people, skills and infrastructure. The  bottom line is that local politicians are those who should drive forward the  agenda for change, and not British Treasury Ministers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It should be noted that the debate is not solely about  income tax. The Assembly must cast the net wider than that. It must be bold in  its approach and consider such incentives as targeted tax reliefs for rural  businesses, the manufacturing sector and small and medium enterprises (SMEs).  Many hold the view that tax-varying powers could also help to offset investment  problems that are created by industrial derating. Initiatives such as  plastic-bag tax or other green levies could be considered, some of which &mdash; the  plastic-bag tax, in particular &mdash; have been successful in the South. The  Assembly could also examine taxes on inheritance, real estate, gambling and  vehicles.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A crucial aspect of strengthening enterprise is the nurturing of new businesses. Part of that should  involve lightening the financial burden on those businesses during their  start-up period through a system of tax relief for new businesses on the basis  of a compulsory, agreed and accountable action plan, particularly for those who  locate in New TSN areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My party is not alone in seeking much greater fiscal freedom.  I do not believe that it is alone in wanting the Executive to have tax-varying  powers. It also wants the Executive to be able to develop a borrowing facility. Such fiscal freedoms can unlock the  Assembly&rsquo;s potential to set its own funding priorities. They would also  be an essential component in the development of a radical plan of action to  tackle deprivation and to ensure the long-term economic development that is  needed. Without them, the Assembly will be set to fail. There will be huge  funding gaps across the public spending programme. It will be forced to rely to  a greater degree on private finance to  develop investment in essential infrastructure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly will face many tough choices and difficulties in the time ahead unless it moves to  develop greater fiscal freedom and  strengthen the local economy. I, therefore, ask Members to support the  motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  find myself in agreement with one small point that the proposer of the motion  has put forward, which is that there is growing consensus that Northern Ireland  must have a stronger economy. Indeed, it is for the very reason that my party  supports the ideal of a strong economy in Northern Ireland that it will not  support the motion that has been put forward by the Members in the opposite Benches.  My party regards the motion to be ill-judged, ill-conceived and, indeed, with  consequences that I suspect the Members opposite have not considered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was somewhat struck  by the picture that was painted by the Member &mdash; one with which many of  us would have a great deal of sympathy &mdash; of trying to create a low-tax economy.  I am aware that the party sitting opposite is somewhat chameleon-like when it  comes to its tax policy. Not long ago, in the Republic of Ireland,  its call was to raise corporation tax; then it was to reduce it. By the sound of the nice picture that was painted by  the proposer of the motion &mdash; that of a thriving low-tax economy &mdash; one can detect a nascent conversion to  Thatcherite principles from across the Chamber. However, I wonder how deep that  commitment is.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unless the power to vary tax levels will be used as some  sort of macho tool that the Assembly can say it has, regardless of whether it  actually wants to use it, it can be used only in either of two ways. The  Scottish Parliament has shown reluctance to use tax-varying powers. Despite the  number of years that it has been in place and the opportunity to vary the rate  of income tax by three pence from its  outset, the Scottish Parliament has steered clear of from those powers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">One of two scenarios can take place with tax  variation, either of which the Member who moved the motion seems to have hinted  at as being an option, even though she has not said so explicitly. One scenario  is that we use tax-varying powers to reduce income tax and reduce the levels of  taxation in the country. Obviously, a reduction in the level of income tax  could help to stimulate the economy. However, any tax cuts would then be  directly related to the block grant.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If we were to reduce  our levels of taxation to stimulate the economy in a wider context, and  therefore have a reduced block grant, can Sinn F&eacute;in Members tell me which  programmes they would intend to cut as a result of that tax reduction? Will  they list, for example, which hospitals they would intend to close, or which  programmes they would intend to axe, to allow for that tax cut?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alternatively, and this is the second scenario, tax can be  varied upwards. That is where the fear lies. We have already witnessed in the  Chamber the danger of some parties getting involved in a spending spree. My colleague Sammy Wilson accused the SDLP of  spending the Northern Ireland block grant &mdash; through its motions &mdash; two or  three times over in the space of a fortnight. Inevitably, pressure would be  applied to bump up the rate of taxation. Again, the effect on our economy would  be to drive Northern Ireland  into a much-higher-tax location, thus making it less attractive to business.  Therefore, the opportunities on that basis are somewhat ill judged.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a further implication. If we were to have a level  of tax-varying powers above and beyond that that we have already &mdash; to do with  the regional rate &mdash; pressure would come from Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury if, at any  stage, we sought funding for a special project or any form of additional investment.  If we were not taxing to the highest possible rate that we could, HM Treasury  would simply ask why it should give the Executive extra money, whenever we  could raise tax by 2p, 3p or 4p in the pound, or whatever our tax-varying  powers happened to be.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We might even be faced with a situation in which HM  Treasury said that it would cut our block grant, in real terms, because the  Assembly had the opportunity to increase taxes if it wanted to maintain current  programmes. That is why I believe that the Member&rsquo;s motion is particularly ill  judged.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also believe that we have made a very separate and specific case. The Department of Finance and  Personnel and its Committee have done a great deal of detailed work in  making a case for a specific cut in corporation tax. We should stay focused on  the tax relief or tax credits that may result from a cut in corporation tax. If  we widen the debate to take in the nonsense of a wider tax variation, we will  lose focus. We will lose the opportunity to make that strong case for a  reduction in corporation tax. I oppose the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I,  too, oppose the motion. I oppose some of the comments and suggestions that the  Sinn F&eacute;in Member made in moving the motion. Sinn F&eacute;in seems to be saying that a  publicly controlled economy with more taxation could do things better than the  private sector could do. I fear that that would not be the case. The Sinn F&eacute;in  Member said near the tail end of her speech that, unless more funding were  received, there would be gaps in its expenditure plans. Clearly, Sinn F&eacute;in is  not talking about tax variation but about tax increases.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as I am concerned, one of the key roles of Members  in Committee is to scrutinise each departmental budget. We must make best use  of our existing funding, and we must do that first. Here we are, on the first  day of the new session, and what is happening? A motion has been tabled that  asks for more money. That is ridiculous. Our eye is off the ball. We should be  concentrating on what we are doing with our existing money. We should be  concentrating on getting the best value from that before demanding more money from individuals or from the private  sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In an Assembly debate on 15 May 2007, Mitchel McLaughlin &mdash;  one of the Members in whose name the motion  stands &mdash; called for tax-varying powers  and for the introduction of a system of progressive direct taxation.  What is progressive direct taxation? I can think only that he meant income tax  or business taxes. It would be helpful if Sinn F&eacute;in Members could explain what they  meant when they advocated such a system in an earlier debate.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some politicians appear to believe that they can solve our  economic problems by imposing additional taxes on workers and businesses and by  increasing public expenditure. They seem to  believe that, somehow, civil servants can help to solve the problems.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For Northern    Ireland to progress economically, we must  carefully consider what effects any changes we make may have on the real world  and the real economy in which people have to earn a living and sell products.  We must ensure that we encourage sustainable jobs that are not reliant on state  funding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recently met an employer who explained that even the  proposed rises in industrial rates would be likely to result in a reduction in  his R&amp;D and marketing budget. That would call into question his ability to  make future investment in his plant and therefore place a question mark over  future long-terms jobs in the real economy. We must be very careful about what  we do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Tax-varying powers would also mean administrative costs for  the Department for Social Development. Our benefits system would have to be  modified somehow. New training would have to be provided so that staff in the  jobs and benefits offices could know how any proposed new income tax would  affect somebody starting or leaving work. Such training would bring costs, too.  Furthermore, HM Revenue and Customs would have to change its system and develop  a system specific to Northern    Ireland, and I suspect that we would have to  bear the cost of any such changes. This motion is a nonsense. Can our fragile  private sector absorb those costs? Local employers would be faced with  additional administrative costs with the introduction of a new local tax. This  proposal would mean additional burdens for existing employers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A recent Scottish briefing paper indicated that, for  someone earning &pound;15,000, a 1p increase in income tax would cost about &pound;91 per  year, while a 5p increase would cost about &pound;495. For a family with two salaries  of &pound;15,000, a 1p increase would cost about &pound;182, while a 5p increase would cost  about &pound;910. The proposers of the motion should be honest and say how this  proposal would affect working families. Ultimately, it would be a tax on people  who are working and own businesses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to create more business opportunities and more real  work opportunities for everyone so that we can survive the long-term changes  that are occurring as the Barnett formula starts to converge the current  expenditure levels in different regions in the United Kingdom. We must ensure  that, whatever we do, we encourage real jobs in the private sector. We must not  do anything that will threaten those jobs. New taxes will not create new  sustainable jobs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Thus, rather than debating this motion on our first day  back after the summer recess, we should be considering what we can do to  improve the current system. Sinn F&eacute;in appears to be out of touch with the  economic realities of the real world. Let us get back down to work in the  Assembly and spend the money that we currently have as best as we can. I oppose  the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  The SDLP has long believed that Northern    Ireland needs tailored solutions to address  its unique political, economic, geographic and social profile. That remains our  stance as we work with colleagues to plot a way forward for our community after  decades of conflict and underinvestment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Without greater fiscal flexibility, we are limited in the  steps that we can take to address difficulties such as the poor state of our  infrastructure or the fact that our gross value added (GVA) remains 20% below  the UK  average. Sharing this island, as we do, with a successful economy and distinct tax regime clearly adds urgency  to those issues that affect our competitiveness as a region. In recognition of  such challenges, my party has for several years been calling for greater fiscal  discretion for the Assembly. Moreover, SDLP leader,  Mark Durkan, played a central role in negotiating the low-cost borrowing  facility of the reinvestment and reform initiative (RRI), to which I will  return.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To put this debate in context, the present finance agenda  is loaded quite heavily. With ongoing consider&shy;ation of the rates system, the  independent review of water and sewerage, the comprehensive spending review,  the Varney Review and a slowdown in public sector spending, this debate may be  important, but securing additional powers may not be the most pressing item on  the agenda.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I endorse the premise of the motion, I am, to a  degree, surprised that it has been proposed. Why call for an Executive borrowing facility while opposing the use  of the facility that we already have, and which is currently funding  approximately &pound;200 million a year of our infrastructure spending &mdash; a borrowing  power that was introduced despite opposition from the proposer&rsquo;s party? I  should point out that the first and only use of the borrowing facility before  suspension allowed us to build a world-class cancer centre without putting a  penny on the rates. Does Sinn F&eacute;in still oppose that?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The other curious thing about the motion is that Sinn F&eacute;in  repeatedly argued that we should not seek a borrowing power before we had secured  a peace dividend, on the grounds that it would look as though we had given up  on securing such additional funds. The question arises: has Sinn F&eacute;in given up  on the peace dividend? The SDLP believes that to borrow at the preferential  rates available to the Government can be part of a cost-effective strategy to  stimulate our economy. Such benefits will more than make up for the cost of  borrowing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The suspension of the Assembly in 2002 meant that the terms under which the borrowing power is  currently exercised are not to our satisfaction, so we must renegotiate  those terms. We want investment to be paid for in a fair and affordable manner.  We opposed the old rates system because it penalised those on low incomes. We  have been equally clear that the direct rule conclusion to the rating review  resulted in unaffordable and unjust rates for a significant number of people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At its inception, the  reform and reinvestment initiative was linked to the creation of the  Strategic Investment Board, a body which we proposed to enable a radical new  approach to long-term spending commitments so that they would be devised in a  strategic manner, refined by expert financial input and agreed in partnership  with leaders of civic society. It is surely no accident that the Southern  Government have copied that model by establishing a centre of expertise within  its National Development Finance Agency to build skills and capacity in the  area of public procurement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In considering the issue of tax-varying powers, my party  and I obviously support the idea of greater capacity in the Assembly to tackle  unique local circumstances. Consistent with our position on corporation tax,  the SDLP has proposals to address competition issues arising from our land  border with the South and to expand on existing co-operation on infrastructure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I support the motion, I caution Members that, on  such matters, the devil will be in the detail when it comes to negotiations  with the British Govern&shy;ment. Mr Brown is unlikely to agree to any change that  will simply increase our income; he might, in fact, place further pressure on  our Budget &mdash; a point that has already been made. Should it come to the point of  negotiating such developments, our representatives would need to have their  wits about them and be confident that any package that is agreed is genuinely  to our advantage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In summary, and in part, in an attempt to ensure that this  House communicates with one voice &mdash; although I hear the utterances of other  voices &mdash; I support the motion, in so far as it is competent, given our existing  borrowing powers &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Your time is up, Mr O&rsquo;Loan.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  support the motion, and in so doing, it is important to stress at the outset  that that is not an endorsement of the potential of the current Executive to  use such powers wisely, but rather a recognition on the part of the opposition  in the Chamber that the ability to deliver real change for the economy of Northern Ireland and its people depends on the  Assembly having real fiscal powers. Without those powers, we have only a  second-rate form of devolution.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members have already mentioned corporation tax. If  there is to be a reduction in corporation tax in Northern Ireland, we will have to  have tax-varying powers; that is the way in which the Treasury would envisage  that happening.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  No. I have a lot to get through. I will now move to the matter of the regional  rate. Members have spoken about the need to avoid irresponsible tax rises, but  the regional rate is already used as a form of taxation in Northern Ireland.  It is no longer linked to any particular delivery of services, but is simply  used by the Executive to balance the books. We have already seen 19% rates  hikes in previous years; we will wait with interest to see what happens in the  future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, water charges are also looming as a means of  balancing the books. Although the Assembly deferred water charges for one year,  no feasible plans have been put forward to date for avoiding those charges in  the future. Our budgets are locked into the assumption of water charges, and to  avoid them we will have to divert money from elsewhere.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are challenges for all of us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have to consider the regional convergence of Northern Ireland with the rest of the UK. At present,  we are 80% of that average. The current draft regional economic strategy from  the previous Administration, but not yet replaced by the current  Administration, does not see any meaningful convergence of our economy with the UK average. Despite all the  investment into Northern    Ireland over recent years, the figures are  not changing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">British Government policy may nominally be committed to  regional convergence, but it is clear that successive British Governments have  prioritised London and the south-east of England as the main driver of the overall UK economy.  That area is viewed as something to be protected at all costs, and it seems  that the Government are happier to keep the regions of the UK financially  dependent, rather than give them the powers to make a real difference and to  make their economies and their financial situations sustainable. Therefore, the real challenge of the Assembly is  to stand up to that and demand the  powers to make a real change.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps the real tragedy is that there are people inside  and outside the Assembly who seem happy to accept  and collude in the preservation of a conservative status quo that will  not make any difference to our economy. In the last Assembly, when Alliance raised the issue of tax-varying powers, our calls  were dismissed by those in office because of fears that the UK Treasury would  use it as an opportunity to reassess the Barnett formula and cut the financial  subvention from London.  There are those who seem to think that the fact that we receive a subvention of  &pound;7 billion a year is a major achievement and something to be protected at all costs. In fact, it is a sign of  the weakness of our situation, something that is unsustainable in the  long term and something we must tackle rather than simply bank.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to stress that giving this Assembly  tax-varying powers is not tantamount to advocating or accepting an overall  increase in the level of tax. It is about giving the Assembly the opportunity  to do things differently and the assent to engage in effective policy changes,  with the full range of options.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a party, we have made the case to the Treasury, as the  Executive and a number of Committees have done, for it to give the Assembly the  powers to vary the rate of corporation tax.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  No. I have already said no.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  Do you not understand &mdash;?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Does the Member for South Antrim not  understand the meaning of the word no?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Corporation tax is one of the major pieces of the jigsaw  for trying to improve our economy, but it is not the only one. The private  sector must be given the ability and the stimulus to develop and attract inward  investment. This is not about imposing extra burdens on businesses or families;  it is about trying to create the conditions  in which we can become a more attractive location for business to  operate in.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alliance  also believes that consideration should be given to replacing the regional rate  with a local income tax. We are honest about that. The regional rate is not  linked to providing local services; it is already, in effect, a Northern Ireland  form of taxation that a large portion of  the public sees as being unfair. Consideration must be given to finding  a better way of doing things.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alliance  believes that much greater use should be made of environmental charges and  taxes. The burden should be shifting away from taxes on income and property  towards things that are bad in our society, such  as damage to the environment. Tax-varying powers would allow the  Assembly to be much more creative.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I am sure there are few topics discussed in the Chamber that fill working  families and businesses with as much dread as this one, and what I have heard  from the Benches opposite so far has not dispelled that fear. I have no doubt  that someone somewhere in the Chamber has the ability to exercise the powers to  vary and raise taxes responsibly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Not on the opposite side.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I am certainly not looking opposite for it; that is for sure. The requisite  fiscal responsibility seems to be sorely lacking.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since its inception in May, the Assembly has called for everything from free personal care to free  prescriptions to more investment in the rail network. Those are all  worthy causes but, at the same time, Members have resisted increasing revenue  streams, whether from business or from ratepayers. It is worth repeating that  the Assembly needs a reality check and not more politics of the blank cheque. With  the ability to vary tax, I fear &mdash; and there is clear evidence for this &mdash; that  Members would not be able to resist the temptation to raise taxes to pay for  each and every demand that is made of them.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Even if the Assembly were not so immature and some Members  were not so fiscally irresponsible, the attitude to taxation of parties in the  Chamber &mdash; particularly of the party proposing today&rsquo;s motion &mdash; would render the  proposal utterly unacceptable. No less than the Sinn F&eacute;in president let the cat  out of the bag in an interview with the &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo; in March 2007. He was  asked:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Your party opposes water charges &mdash; but can you  categorically say you will abolish the tap tax? And if so, how will you replace  the lost hundreds of millions of pounds of revenue.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Adams responded:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Obviously, public services have to be paid for, but  Sinn Fein is looking for tax varying powers for the Executive.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Even someone with as rudimentary a grasp of taxation and  economics as the Member for West Belfast can  understand what that means: Sinn F&eacute;in intends to pay for services with tax  increases.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Further evidence of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s true intentions can clearly  been seen when its support for tax-raising powers is viewed in tandem with its  commitment to the harmonisation of tax rates on an all-island basis.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In recent times, Members have heard much about the South&rsquo;s  competitive corporation tax rate. However, it would be short-sighted to come to  the conclusion on the basis of that alone that the Irish Republic  is some sort of tax nirvana. A cursory glance at the Republic&rsquo;s tax rates  reveals that its top rate of income tax is higher than that in Northern  Ireland, its VAT rate of 21% is 3&middot;5% higher and, at 9%, its top rate of stamp  duty is some 6% higher. The tax policy that Sinn F&eacute;in wants to foist on Northern Ireland  is probably OK as long as people do not own a house, work or buy anything.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It seems to be simple and straightforward. Sinn F&eacute;in  whispers sweet nothings about incentivising &ldquo;this&rdquo; and encouraging &ldquo;that&rdquo;  through the tax system. However, the harsh reality for those who matter &mdash;  taxpayers &mdash; is that should republicans be granted their wish, their pockets  will be hit harder and harder. Given Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s socialist and Marxist  persuasion &mdash; although sometimes their views bear more resemblance to Groucho  Marx than Karl Marx &mdash; businesses and the hard-working middle classes will be  hit the hardest.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  Member said that Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s policies would mean that people would be grand as  long as they do not work, own a house or buy anything. In light of that, will  the type of people who are attracted to Northern Ireland result in a  society of hermits living in caves?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  That is a good, well-made point. If Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s policy were implemented, the  working class would evaporate because no one would work under those conditions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I became involved in public life partly to assist business  and to help those ordinary people in the Province who have been hardest hit  over the years by the tax and rates regimes. For 35 years, Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s associates  in the IRA subjected the people and businesses of Northern Ireland to a war. There is  no way that my party or I will support Sinn F&eacute;in in subjecting those same  people to a war on their pockets.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  Other than Sinn F&eacute;in Members, few Members in the Chamber will not see the  motion for what it is: a cheap, ill-considered stunt to grab a few quick headlines. However, it is important to  expose the political and economic hypocrisy that Sinn F&eacute;in displays in  suggesting the fundamental economic changes contained in the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In political terms, I need hardly remind Members that Northern Ireland is, and will remain, an  integral part of the United Kingdom,  together with England, Scotland and Wales. Although significant powers  have been devolved to those regions, they combine as one nation to consider  legislation on fundamental issues of national  interest such as defence, taxation and economic policy. As a sovereign  nation, it is in our interest that those decisions are taken at Westminster. If Sinn F&eacute;in  is genuinely interested in influencing Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government on taxation, it  should accept its electoral responsibilities to its constituents by taking its  seats at Westminster  and advancing the arguments in the proper place. The DUP always lobbies  vigorously for the best interests of all classes and creeds in Northern Ireland.  However, it does so from within the United Kingdom of which we are all  citizens.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The general economic approach suggested in the motion, and  the policies that were soundly rejected by the people of the Irish Republic  in the recent general election, clearly demonstrate that Sinn F&eacute;in has  abandoned its Marxist economic principles. It has now turned its attention to Northern Ireland  to try to advance its tax-and-spend policies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Such policies would inevitably lead to higher taxation of  working people, increased borrowing, rising debt and loss of stability in our  local economy. Equally worrying is the fact that Sinn F&eacute;in does not seem to  have recognised the potential knock-on effect of tax-varying powers. Does the  party truly believe that the block grant  from Westminster  would be unaffected? Can its members not see the potential impact on Northern Ireland  if that level of support is lost?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">From the outset, I said that such an approach was ill  considered, and I have illustrated that in political and economic terms. What  renders the motion more irresponsible is its timing. Just over three months  into the life of the new Executive, Sinn F&eacute;in appears to have lost touch with  reality, seeking more power rather than applying itself to facing the many  challenging issues that are before the Assembly. I have no doubt that the  people of Northern Ireland  want to see Members considering and delivering on those issues before we begin  to think about an extension of our powers. I share that view and oppose the  motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  Let us assume that the House votes in favour of the motion and that the  Minister of Finance and Personnel believes that it a good idea and wishes to  negotiate with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to obtain total fiscal independence for  this part of the United    Kingdom. May I introduce a few words that  most Members do not seem to realise exist in the English language: the first  one being &ldquo;recession&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Imagine if there were a major recession in the United Kingdom  following the transfer of fiscal powers to this local Assembly. All of the  taxes will have been increased &mdash; for I have not heard one example of tax being  decreased; all tax-varying powers are to be used to increase taxes &mdash; and Her  Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury will to come under great pressure because of the state of  the national economy. There is a similar situation ongoing in the United States  at the moment. Commentators are referring to it as the sub-prime crisis in the  banking community. I do not understand it completely. However, if we were to  have a major recession, with job losses &mdash; not at the level of 2% that exists  currently in my constituency, but real recession that cuts deep into employment  &mdash; what would Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government do, if there were independent tax-raising and tax-varying powers in Northern  Ireland? They would say, &ldquo;Bye-bye boys&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">England  would look towards Scotland,  which already has tax-varying powers, and would increase its 2p variation on  tax. England  would also increase the tax variation that it would have given to Stormont and  the Welsh Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People should realise that if this region of the United Kingdom  is given tax-raising powers, and we move into a recession, we would have to pay  for that. We do have to do that now because we are in a very beneficial  position through being part of the United Kingdom and part of the national  economy. Those who say we need more tax-varying independent powers need to grow  up a wee bit. It would be a one-way street in which one would be asking for the  tax-varying power that Scotland  asked for and then asking for more. There would be increased tax powers and  increased taxes for Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am talking in a pragmatic way, rather than on the  principle of devolving and separating the United Kingdom into different tax areas. The Alliance MLA,  Dr Farry, did not realise what he was saying in that there would be a  Chancellor of the Exchequer here in Northern Ireland with total powers over capital taxation.  If he had given way and allowed me to speak, that is what I would have told him  that he was proposing. That would be a ludicrous position for us to be in.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The level of corporation tax is set by the national  Government, and it will be very difficult to achieve a variation because Gordon  Brown will set his face against it. However, we will wait and see the report of  the independent review.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are on dangerous ground. The Assembly is an  administration that spends part of the national take for schools, hospitals,  and for all the things that we need to do to serve and benefit our  constituents. The last thing we need is a variation of tax-raising powers, and  I am very concerned that the SDLP and the Alliance Party appear to be going  into the Lobbies &mdash; if the House is divided &mdash; to support independent tax-raising  powers for the Northern Ireland Assembly on the basis of an opinion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must move slowly in the Assembly and in the Executive  and try to administer the block grant &mdash; the subsidy and support from our  national Government &mdash; to improve the services that we provide to our people.  This is a dangerous course to embark upon, and I hope that anyone here who is a  unionist with a small &ldquo;u&rdquo; and who has any leaning towards being part of the United Kingdom  will go into the Lobby tonight and oppose the transfer of tax-varying powers.  It will do nothing to help the economy; it will do nothing to help the ordinary  working man; and it will do nothing to help businesses in Northern Ireland.  It will also weaken the United    Kingdom, which is something that matters to  me.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  The general public would be totally dismayed if the motion was passed and, even  worse, if the Government at Westminster  decided to grant our wishes. The public have a sensible attitude towards  politicians and money, and they want as few chances as possible for politicians  to have anything to do with their wallets. I  suspect that is even true of my colleague, the Minister of Finance and  Personnel, who, during his brief time as Minister and during his time on  Castlereagh Borough Council, gained a reputation for financial prudence that  made Gordon Brown look profligate. Even with his reputation, the public would  not want tax-raising powers to be transferred to the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been dressed in  the term &ldquo;tax varying powers&rdquo;, but the promoter of the motion, Dr Farry  from North Down, said that it is a chance to make real change, to transform the  economy and to spend money on all the things that we need, such as  infrastructure, health and education. Having listened to the speeches, this is  not about varying tax rates; this is about finding a financial cosh to go out  and mug the public with. That is why people would be dismayed if those powers  were ever transferred to the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan from North Antrim  at least tried to get some variation on it. He said that if the Executive had  those borrowing powers, we could get cancer units that cost nothing. I think  that I am correct in saying that he was an economist, and economists know that  there is no such thing as a free lunch. There is no such thing as a free cancer  unit either. How did we borrow the money? How did we service that debt? We serviced  it by raising the regional rate. It had to be serviced by taking money out of  people&rsquo;s pockets; it did not come out of the heavens and appear to us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The point must be made that if the Executive had  tax-varying powers, things would go in only one direction. The Member for North  Down, Mr Weir, pointed out that, during earlier debates, I mentioned that we  spent the block grant almost on a weekly basis. Members across the way proposed  many things in the first six weeks of this Assembly, including more money for  railways, dental care, refuges for battered people, personal care for the  elderly, donations for the Irish who are about to get thrown out of the USA,  and the appointment of a commissioner for older people. There is a whole list,  and I am only a quarter of the way through it. If the Executive were given  tax-varying powers, they would not have to make difficult choices &mdash; they would  just spend the money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry supports the motion, because one member of his  party alone could spend all the money in the block grant in a day. Mr McCarthy  seems to treat this place as some kind of financial auction room. A Member  makes a bid and then he makes a higher bid. Then the next week he is back to  try to outbid the person who proposed good things for the public the previous  week. His party, especially, would need to be watched if tax-varying powers  were ever transferred to the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are other reasons why tax-raising powers are not  something that we should seek. First, it would be a one-way street. There would  be more spending, and I do not know whether there would be any curtailment on  people or examination of the real priorities and choices, because the Executive  would have no choice; they would simply dip into the taxpayers&rsquo; pocket more  often and take more money out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, as Members heard in the last debate, Northern Ireland  needs a competitive economy, but we cannot be a competitive economy if our  system simply extracts more money. Members who are economists will know all  about the Laffer curve &mdash; I will not bore the Chamber with it now; I used to  bore people all afternoon with it in school. The Laffer curve shows that the  more that is taken from people, the less effort they will make, and the end  result is less revenue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The other issue, and it was well pointed out by the Member  for South Antrim, is that if we adopt tax-varying powers, we will give Gordon  Brown, the Prime Minister, and Mr Darling &mdash; who would be no darling for  Northern Ireland &mdash; the opportunity to tell us that we are on our own and if we  want to raise tax, we can.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I do not normally have to speak after such an impassioned speech, and I will  try to raise the temperature even further.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I listened with dismay to the arguments of the three  parties on the opposite side of the Chamber. Their arguments were inconsistent, incoherent and incredible; they  showed a fundamental misunderstanding of how economics works.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When some Members lecture us that the North of Ireland or Northern Ireland &mdash; whatever the title &mdash; does not  work, they show that they do not understand that we are part of the United Kingdom.  All the other regions &mdash; the north east, Scotland,  Wales, the West   Midlands, the south west &mdash; are in the same financial situation as we are because we operate as part of  a much bigger economic whole. Being part of the economic combine that is  the United Kingdom  gives us the resources of the fourth largest economy in the world. Due to that  we can spend &pound;2 for every &pound;1 that is paid in tax. That is why we have our &pound;7  billion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I will give way, Alex, to show that I can argue with the best, unlike Dr Farry  who will not give way.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Wearing another hat on the issue of  industrial derating, the Member wants to vary the take that would be expected  of the manufacturing sector. That is a tax- or rate-varying power of the kind  that we are looking for.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am glad that Alex mentioned that, because as the twig is bent so grows the  tree. Our economy is built on what happened in the past 30 to 40 years.  Removing industrial derating now would ruin our manufacturing, and it would be  the fault of the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members cannot have it both ways on corporation tax; they  cannot cherry-pick and ask for corporation tax to be lowered but still expect  &pound;7 billion to pay for disability living allowance, social benefits, housing and  all the rest.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is an exercise in efficiency; we need to do more with less. The former Chancellor of the  Exchequer and current Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, said that  productivity is the key to all economic success, which means doing more with  less. Before telling the people of Northern Ireland that we would like  more money, we must demonstrate that we can spend wisely what we are already  being given.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If people are taxed more, they will leave. Nobody seems to  understand that &mdash; it is the Laffer curve that Sammy Wilson mentioned, and it  applies to industrial derating as well. If too much tax is put on people, they will go elsewhere. The Northern Ireland economy needs  more people, more skills and more entrepreneurs. That will build our economy;  that is what the Assembly has to sort out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps some of the more educated Members will correct me,  but I recall that income tax was introduced as a temporary measure to fund the  Napoleonic war. The trouble with tax is that, once raised, it never comes down. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is that the big battle about funding social  programmes, which is why we are all here, has been fought and won. There is now  little difference between the Tories and new Labour. Why? Because the economic  question has been resolved: a free market with a social conscience is needed to  make sure that there are no excesses. That is the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If Members send out a message that the Assembly will raise  taxes, this place will last about six weeks. The people did not put us here to  put our hands in their pockets: they elected us to manage their resources as best we can. Northern Ireland has a lot of  resources, and we must manage them properly. I am fundamentally opposed  to the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for  the opportunity to respond to the debate. I do not agree with the proposer of  the motion, but it is nonetheless useful that the Assembly takes the  opportunity to debate such matters. However, I hope that the matter ends here,  and that the proposer is merely taking the opportunity to debate the issue and  does not push the motion to a vote.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the proposer that it is necessary to have the  tools to do something different and that we need to invest in skills and  infrastructure and in the other drivers of our economy. However, I question her  suggestion on tax-varying or &mdash; as most Members have now defined them &mdash;  tax-raising powers for Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have listened to the debate with great interest, and I  think that it would be useful to correct some of the misconceptions and  misunderstandings on what is a critical issue for the Executive. I will also set  out the nature of our relationship, as a devolved institution within the United Kingdom,  with the national Government and Parliament.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will explain briefly how the Executive derive their  funding resources, which are presented in the budgetary process that the  Assembly approves. I also want to highlight how the fiscal framework applies to  Northern Ireland  and what discretion is available to the Executive on issues such as borrowing.  The bulk of the public expenditure available to the Executive is provided  through the operation of the Barnett formula by which Northern Ireland  gets a population-based share of expenditure allocations that Treasury makes to  aspects of the work of certain Whitehall Departments. The Barnett mechanism  presently accounts for approximately 92% of the resources allocated in the Northern Ireland  budget. The remaining resources distributed by the Executive are generated  through taxes and charges such as rates and water charges.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members should also be aware that the Executive have a borrowing  power agreed with Treasury &mdash; the reinvestment and reform Initiative (RRI) &mdash;  which allows them to borrow from the National Loans Fund. It allows us to draw  down additional capital resources of up to &pound;200 million a year. We have to pay  interest on that borrowing, but it is at a more favourable rate than those  available in commercial markets.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I confirm what the Member for East Antrim Roy Beggs said  about having to pay the interest as well as the loan. Services for the loan  have to come from somewhere, and, in this case, the borrowing has to come from  the regional rate. This borrowing power must be employed prudently to ensure  that we do not commit to future legacy costs that could be an excessive burden  on future generations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to tax-varying powers, the Assembly has powers,  unfettered by Westminster,  to increase the level of our regional rate. Members will be aware that on 15  May 2007, I announced a further review of the new domestic rating system that  was introduced by direct rule Ministers in April of this year. The terms of  reference for the review &mdash; agreed by the Executive &mdash; reflected my intention to  examine a range of options for change. The consultation exercise sought views  on what improvements could be made to the existing system in time for next  year&rsquo;s rates bill and any possible alternatives to the rating system. One of  the issues included in that second strand is the feasibility of tax-varying  powers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In advance of the Executive taking time to consider the  outcome of the consultation process, it is premature to be calling for  tax-varying powers for Northern    Ireland. If the motion were supported, it would under&shy;mine the objective open consultation and  consideration that the Executive endorsed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As for generating financial resources through water charges, the Executive await the report of the  independent water review panel,  which is due shortly. The Executive will then discuss the report&rsquo;s  implications further, before the Assembly takes a final decision. As I have  indicated, it is wrong to say that Northern Ireland does not have  tax-varying powers &mdash; in certain areas, we do. Rates  and water revenues are already policy instruments that are at the  disposal of the Executive. We are also, generally, able to introduce other  taxes as long as they do not replicate existing UK-wide taxes. However, I suspect that the motion seeks income-tax-varying  powers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much of the debate has been about new measures that should  be made available to the Executive. However, room for debate in that area is  severely constrained by the financial framework set by HM Treasury. Members  will be aware of the efforts that we have exerted over recent months to secure  a concession from HM Treasury on corporation tax. While we await the outcome of  the Varney Review, I ask Members not to underestimate how jealously HM Treasury  guards its ownership of fiscal policy. Perhaps, even more significantly, we  should not assume that Northern    Ireland would benefit from tax-varying  powers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some commentators have also referred to the use of external bonds to finance public investment in Northern    Ireland. That is not materially different to using the reinvestment and  reform facility, except that the interest rates that would be applied  are likely to be higher. More importantly, the Treasury rules would still score  those bonds as Government debt &mdash; so we would not be any better off. The only  way in which Northern    Ireland would benefit from some form of  bonds would be if the assets that they  funded were off the Government books. However, that would leave those  assets to be formally owned by the private sector. Politically, that has not  proved to be an over-attractive option to date.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The tax-varying facility available to the Scottish  Executive has also been highlighted as a tax-raising power that the Northern  Ireland Executive should seek. The fact that Scotland has never sought to avail  of that facility indicates that it does not see that measure as a panacea for  its problems. Even if such a power were to be made available through  legislative change, it would pose difficult choices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not clear what the true intention behind the call for  tax-varying powers is, or whether there is any agreement on it. As I see it,  broadly speaking, there are four alternatives. The Member for North Down Peter  Weir mentioned two of them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">First, if the purpose for having tax-varying powers is to  increase tax, Members must recognise that. Increasing direct taxation would  further undermine the region&rsquo;s  competitiveness. At a time when we are making economic growth a key priority  for the Assembly, it would be wrong to  increase the burden on the workforce.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During discussions before I came to the Chamber, I had  decided not to mention the details of the Laffer curve, because I was sure that  no one would mention it in the Assembly, but it seems to be the centre of our  debate. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, we must take into account the fact that, in the  most narrow terms, if one were to increase the tax on anyone in the workforce  in Northern Ireland, the automatic response would be that they would seek an  increase in wages to make up for the loss that they have borne in taxation. One  needs only to look at the repercussive effects of that, particularly in the  public sector, and the reduction there would, therefore, be in spend and  resources.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, however, if the purpose is to reduce taxation, it  would almost certainly have to be self-financed by the Executive, if my reading  of the recent Azores case is correct. It would also be, at best,  unlikely, in circumstances where  there is a fiscal deficit of around &pound;7 billion a year, that the UK  Government would pay for extra tax cuts for Northern Ireland alone. I regard  higher taxes in Northern Ireland  than in other parts of the United    Kingdom as politically unacceptable, and  lower taxes, when we already have a &pound;7 billion fiscal deficit each year, as  unrealistic.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, we may wish to have tax-varying powers without  ever actually deciding to use them. That is not a cost-free option either.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Administration in Scotland pay approximately &pound;8 million a year to keep the necessary systems  in place to allow the option to be used. However, it will cost them  about &pound;10 million to activate those systems, and that is money that could be  spent on front-line services.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The fourth option is for a local Executive to use the  tax-varying powers to replace the regional rate. I suspect that that is the  main thrust of the Alliance Party&rsquo;s argument. However, the impact of increasing  income tax and reducing property taxes would be the expectation that those who  are in work will pay for those who are not. Although we may not always approve of the details of UK-wide fiscal policy, Northern Ireland benefits enormously from being part of the United Kingdom.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry suggested that the availability of tax-varying  powers is the step change that is needed to change the economy of Northern Ireland.  The amount of money that comes in &mdash; or the way that it comes in &mdash; is not the  issue. A property tax or an income tax could bring in exactly the same amount  of money: whatever level the income tax was  increased to could be matched by an  increase in the rates. The only difference that the motion would make  would be to who pays the tax. Any property tax would be paid by those who own  residences in Northern    Ireland. Those who have no property, or no  job &mdash; either because they cannot, or will not, find one &mdash; would not have to pay  under the replacement system that the Alliance Party is offering.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the stimulus to the growth of our economy is not  based so much on the way that the money brought in is allocated in Northern Ireland; productivity is the key, as Mr  McCrea the Member for Lagan   Valley indicated. That is  the step change that is needed to increase our GVA. I am happy to say that we  now have a better GVA than Wales,  with the result that we are no longer the worst part of the United Kingdom  in that respect.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members should consider carefully the implications of  agreeing the motion. The superficial attraction of tax-varying powers does not stand up to detailed scrutiny.  Members should not underestimate the dangers of opening up such matters with  the Treasury. I might find myself at odds with Mr Wilson, my colleague from East Antrim, who thinks that the Treasury would be very  difficult if we were to approach it with such a proposal. I suspect that the  Treasury would say, &ldquo;Yes, go on ahead; we would be happy for you to have those  powers&rdquo;, and wash its hands as a result. However, I hope that the Assembly will  not test the Exchequer and the Government on that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are operating within  a complex public expenditure framework, and unfavourable consequences  are often associated with what might seem a simplistic policy action. As well  as my concerns about the principle behind tax-varying powers, I do not believe  that the timing is right. It is prudent to await the outcome of certain  exercises, such as the rating review, before considering a motion as complex as  this. If the motion is pushed to the vote &mdash; and I hope that it will not be &mdash; I  will oppose it for those reasons. I urge Members to do the same.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Question is &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sorry; Mr McLaughlin should have his right of reply. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I call Mr McLaughlin to make his winding-up speech on the  motion. I am quite sure that Willie Hay would not have done that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  In winding up the debate, I speak in my capacity as economic spokesperson for  Sinn F&eacute;in, despite my being a member of the Committee for Finance and  Personnel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In her earlier remarks, my colleague Ms McCann detailed the  argument for greater economic autonomy for the Executive. I welcome and  acknowledge the fact that some Members who contributed to the debate have  demonstrated a commitment to put the old politics &mdash; the politics of the past &mdash;  behind them. Those politics meant that whichever party sponsored a proposal was  of greater priority than the issue itself, with the effect of predetermining  either support for, or opposition to, a motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps that indicates that some in the Assembly are  emerging from the travails of a deep-seated conflict and are developing a more  mature and pragmatic approach &mdash; a form of  politics based on a democratically grounded, inclusive process that  acknowledges the need to seek and find agreement in the wider interests of the  community. There are others who have yet to embark on that process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I call on Members to vote on the motion based on its merits  and for the benefits that it would deliver to all sections of our people. That  will be the politics of the present and the future; the politics of change that  reflects that which Members are collectively achieving.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, many people in Ireland voted in the People of the Year awards. They recognised the  leader&shy;ship that was necessary to achieve the restoration of the Assembly and to re-establish the primacy of  politics over conflict and division. At times, that leadership was difficult. It was constantly challenged and  criticised by those who lacked courage or vision or who simply were deeply  troubled because they did not understand. Painful decisions had to be made, and  long-standing friendships were put at risk. I congratulate the First Minister  and the Deputy First Minister, who were nominated on behalf of all Members, for  their achieve&shy;ments, along with Bertie Ahern and Tony Blair, in bringing the  process to this point.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Will there be a ruling that Members  speak somewhere within the parameters of the motion?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is not a point of order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  A little patience will show the connection that I wish to make.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the context of my earlier comments, Sinn F&eacute;in recognises  the pressure and pain involved, and appreciates and applauds the resolve shown  across the Chamber that has made progress possible and secured advances that  have benefited the entire community. From conversations and contacts that I  have had with people from all walks of life &mdash; business, social, political and  academic &mdash; all are agreed that the biggest barrier to building a sustainable  economy in the North is the fact that fiscal policy, taxation and public  expenditure are all determined in London. All are agreed that that must change,  and Members have an unmistakable mandate from the electorate to deliver that  agenda.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  No, I have a lot to say and I have lost time already.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All are agreed that the situation must change, and we have  an unmistakable mandate from the electorate to deliver that agenda for change.  An economic policy that is designed and administered by Whitehall  will always be delivered for the benefit of the island of Britain,  invariably with inadequate consideration of the special needs of the North.  Although inherently unjust, that is perfectly understandable. That is the  status quo. Our needs will always be peripheral and coincidental to those of Britain &mdash; an  afterthought, for want of a better expression. Simply put, that is why the  status quo must change if Members are to successfully plot a trajectory of  economic recovery for the North.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Not only are we excluded from the economic advances in the  rest of Ireland because we are locked into the one-size-fits-all approach of  the British Treasury, but Members must work  within the parameters of the inadequate and unfair Barnett formula,  which has already been referred to, and a privatisation agenda that has been  imposed by politicians who will never be held accountable to the electorate in  the North.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In their engagements with Gordon Brown, the British  Treasury and, latterly, with the Varney Review, all parties &mdash; including Sinn  F&eacute;in, to correct some of the misrepresentation from across the Floor &mdash; argued  for a more competitive level of corporation tax. It does no service to anyone  to completely and wilfully misrepresent the positions of the respective  parties. We are all in this together.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In any event, Executive Ministers will require a more  realistic mechanism to calculate the block grant that will effectively take  those factors into account and ensure the allocation of funding on the basis of  need and a fairer distribution of resources. I particularly welcome today&rsquo;s  comments from Ian Paisley, who made it clear that the Executive would have to  seek additional resources to address the issue of poverty and its underlying  causes. Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In debates in the Programme for Government Committee, set  up in the Hain Assembly, and in the Preparation for Government Committee, all  parties clearly and consistently supported the introduction of tax-varying powers  in order to grow the regional economy; develop and target tax incentives  towards areas of high unemployment; encourage small businesses; and enable  other specific sectors, such as the social economy sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Recent consensus reports from the Programme for Government  process demonstrated that the parties shared a clear understanding of the  imperative need to acquire the tools necessary to reinvigorate the private  sector of the economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is vital that the parties sustain that consensus as the  Varney Review team prepares to report to the British Government. In that  context, I welcome the presence of the Minister, and I would like to respond to  his comments at the end of my speech.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A succession of unionist spokespersons &mdash; and I can see no  distinction in the unionist position &mdash; appeared to argue that the North has a  basket-case economy and that we dare not interfere with the subvention. It  seems that we can only exist on the basis of &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  No, I am sorry I will not.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It seems that we can only continue to exist and project  into the future on the basis of that dependency.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ultimately, we must consider whether we can make a better  fist of government than direct rule Ministers, and that we can deal &mdash; as we  will have to deal some time &mdash; with the underperforming economy in the North.  Somebody must explain to me, as no one across the Floor has done so, how  supporting an argument for reducing corporation tax to 12&middot;5% is not an argument  for tax variation. I accuse Members of responding to the authorship of the  motion rather than to the issues that they are supposed to discuss.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the course of many discussions, Sinn F&eacute;in also made  clear its aspiration to see the introduction of an unrestricted borrowing facility to replace the RRI. That proposal  was not supported, and Sinn F&eacute;in supports the democratic outcome of that  discussion. In the event, all the parties, including Sinn F&eacute;in, supported a  minimum of the separation of the RRI facility from the so-called convergence  principle, under which the Treasury had introduced the water-charges policy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I note that the SDLP spokesperson took credit for RRI, yet  the SDLP must take responsibility for the fact that that measure and the  strings and conditions that were attached was exploited to introduce water  charges. Thankfully, the need for the separation of RRI from the convergence  principle was successfully impressed upon the Treasury and Gordon Brown.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern economy has always suffered from the  disadvantage of peripherality. Most regions in Britain have enjoyed an economic  head start over the North. The British Government&rsquo;s statistics bear testimony  to the failure of Whitehall  policy over a period so extended as to be absolutely undeniable. The current  policy simply does not work for the North. It will not, and cannot be made to,  work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, intense competition between and within the regions on the island of Ireland  is also an unavoidable reality &mdash; particularly when trying to attract  inward investment. Sinn F&eacute;in would prefer that we were working towards  harmonisation of tax regimes across the  island and a level economic playing field. However, that is another  day&rsquo;s work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In any event, Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see greater local autonomy  over the setting of objectives and goals in expenditure and investment. These  are only some of the issues that support the impetus for tax-varying powers to  be given to the Assembly. Ultimately, it is up to us to decide how they are  applied.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Assembly to support the motion. The point made by the Minister deserves a response, and  Sinn F&eacute;in will not push the House towards a Division, although it  supports the motion. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and negatived.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 5.44 pm.</p>
