                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to refer to two points of order raised
                yesterday. In a reply to Rev Dr William McCrea, I directed his
                attention to Standing Orders in respect of exclusion motions. I
                should, of course, have directed him to the Northern Ireland Act
                1998. The precise reference is section 30(5)(a).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood, on a further point of order,
                asked me whether I would make correspondence from the Chief
                Constable available to the House. I have taken further advice on
                the matter, and I have placed a copy of the letter from the
                Chief Constable in the Assembly Library.</p>

                confirm that the Chief Constable, in his correspondence to you,
                took nothing away from the necessity for such a search of the
                Sinn Féin/IRA offices but merely from the nature of the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Is it in
                order for the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to
                rush a piece of legislation to the House, admit that the
                legislation will not even go through the normal consultative
                process and then snub the House by refusing to come along to
                listen to the views of the House on this controversial
                legislation that is designed to add to their empire, to the
                quangos in Northern Ireland and to the cost of administration?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am somewhat puzzled by the Member’s
                remarks because they bear no relation to what I have just read
                out. In case the Member was not listening or is unclear, he said
                that the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister do not
                intend to come to hear the House. The letter actually says that
                they wish to withdraw the Second Stage because they do wish to
                be here to hear the views of the House. I trust that that is
                clear. What is being requested is that the Bill’s Second Stage
                not be moved today but be moved at a later stage. It is not to
                be moved today because the First Minister and Deputy First
                Minister cannot be here.<i> </i>I trust that I have made clear
                what the letter says as distinct from what the Member said.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Fantasy-land
                ideas continue in the light of that announcement. Do the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister think that their junior
                Ministers are incompetent? I am sure that you will confirm that
                there is nothing to stop the junior Ministers in the Office of
                the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister from proposing
                the Bill. They have filled in previously for the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister. Is it not true that the Bill was
                rushed, as my Colleague Sammy Wilson has said? The Bill received
                no consultation at all with the relevant vested interests that
                must be consulted. The First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister are probably so embarrassed by their lack of
                preparation that they are not in a position to come to the House
                today.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. That is not a point of order. In
                respect of the Member’s comments about junior Ministers, they
                will speak for themselves, and the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister may speak for themselves —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then let them speak.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I would simply draw attention to the
                fact that the previous point of order raised by his Colleague
                was to the effect that the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister would not wish to be here to hear the Assembly. I
                simply draw attention to that other point of order. However, I
                am here to address points of order of a procedural kind, not
                order of a political kind.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker.
                What will be the procedure with my amendment once suspension
                kicks in later this week?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can only refer to the first part of the
                Member’s question as far as order is concerned. At this
                juncture, I would consider his reasoned amendment still to stand
                for the present. There is simply a rescheduling of the time at
                which it would be taken. However, as far I am concerned, his
                reasoned amendment still stands.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His question is particularly appropriate
                because this is the first occasion on which there has been such
                a reasoned amendment to a Second Stage. Therefore it is
                worthwhile putting on record that this technical device to cause
                a Bill to fall will remain available to be used if the Member
                wishes to proceed with it when a further date for the Second
                Stage is scheduled.</p>

                appropriate, facilities that may be able to be made available. I

                Education that he wishes to make a statement on the review of
                the post-primary education report on responses to consultation.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Education (Mr M McGuinness): </b>The
                publication of the Burns Report a year ago launched the second
                phase of the review that began with research by Prof Tony
                Gallagher and Prof Alan Smith into the effects of our selective
                system of secondary education. Ou<b>r t</b>hanks are due to them
                for their extensive research, whic<b>h provided the basis for
                the work of the post-primary review body.</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also owe a great debt of gratitude to
                Gerry Burns and the other members of the review body, and I want
                to place on record my thanks for their important work in
                producing such a helpful and thought-provoking report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review body’s report was far-reaching
                and challenging, and it stimulated thinking across the education
                sector and beyond about the full range of issues associated with
                post-primary education. It has been the catalyst for one of the
                biggest public debates seen in recent years — certainly the
                biggest in education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When publishing the review body’s report
                for consultation, I invited comments on the proposals,
                suggestions for modifications to the proposals and suggestions
                for alternative arrangements. I extended the consultation period
                until 28 June 2002 to ensure that there was adequate time for
                everyone to consider the very complex and interrelated issues
                raised by the review of post-primary education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the outset I was determined to seek
                comments and views from as wide a range of interests as
                possible. To ensure that all sections of our community had the
                opportunity to respond, my Department conducted an unprecedented
                consultation with five strands. I sincerely thank the civil
                servants in my Department who assisted me throughout the
                process. Their work was of the highest quality, and I appreciate
                it very much.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I held 28 meetings with key interests between
                February and July to hear at first hand their views on the
                review body’s proposals and their suggestions for future
                post-primary arrangements. I invited written submissions, and
                over 1,300 responses were received from our education partners,
                schools, churches, higher and further education and training,
                business, political representatives, the voluntary and community
                sector, human rights and equality interests, and the public.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A detailed response booklet, together with
                supporting information in the form of a video and consultation
                pack, was issued to all schools, institutes of further and
                higher education, training organisations and a range of
                community groups. Booklets were returned by 510 schools. That
                represents 40% of our schools and constitutes the largest ever
                response from schools to a consultation exercise conducted by my
                Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A household response form was issued to each
                household seeking the public’s views on the Burns proposals.
                Over 200,000 household response forms were returned, which
                represented 16% of the adult population. Approximately one fifth
                of the people who returned the forms took the time to include
                additional comments. A survey was also carried out in a
                representative sample of 2,000 homes. The views of young people
                aged 14 to 19 were sought through a series of focus groups
                facilitated by the Northern Ireland Youth Forum.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I met the Committee for Education to discuss
                the arrangements for the consultation generally and also to
                discuss detailed aspects of the video and support materials. The
                Committee made helpful comments, many of which were incorporated
                into the materials. I thank the Chairperson of the Committee for
                Education, Danny Kennedy, and the members of the Committee, for
                their help. Last April, Sammy Wilson tabled a motion for an
                Assembly debate on the review body’s report. I thank him for
                initiating one of the best debates in the House on any issue.
                Members made thoughtful and considered contributions, and I
                listened carefully to all the views expressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout the past year I have emphasised
                repeatedly my determination that the consultation on the
                post-primary review would be open and transparent. To ensure
                that it was, I made a commitment to produce a report drawing
                together the views expressed in the responses to the
                consultation and to put that before the public for everyone to
                see and consider. The report published today fulfils that
                commitment. Copies have been made available to MLAs, and the
                full report is available on my Department’s web site. Copies
                will be issued next week to all schools, our education partners
                and other organisations that responded to the consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In their responses to the consultation, many
                organisations and individuals welcomed the opportunity afforded
                by the review to give their views on post-primary education.
                Many also commented favourably about the way in which the
                consultation was conducted. The consultation generated a healthy
                public debate. I have no doubt that that contributed to the
                impressive response received to the different strands. The
                debate was lively, sometimes passionate, but generally mature,
                well informed and constructive.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that our partners in the education and
                library boards, the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS),
                the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education (NICIE),
                Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta, the Governing Bodies Association
                (GBA), the Transferor Representatives’ Council, the Northern
                Catholic bishops and many other organisations consulted widely
                with their members in formulating their responses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many schools held meetings to discuss the
                issues with staff and parents. Some also included pupils, to
                ensure that their responses reflected the views of the entire
                school community. There were many contributions to the debate in
                the newspapers, which played an important part in ensuring that
                the wider public was kept informed about the range of opinions
                and arguments on all the issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is always easier to be critical of someone
                else’s proposals than to produce your own. I was particularly
                encouraged, therefore, that so many organisations devoted
                considerable time and energy to thinking through how our current
                arrangements could be improved. In their responses, they
                suggested modifications to the review body’s proposals or
                outlined alternative arrangements. I thank all of them for the
                time and commitment that they invested in the review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department analysed the submissions over
                the summer months and has summarised the responses from all the
                strands in the consultation report published today. The report
                sets out the responses to each of the main recommendations in
                the review body’s report and includes other issues raised by
                respondents. The report provides a full picture of the
                consultation responses but has been kept to a manageable length
                to make it accessible to as many people as possible. In the
                interests of openness and transparency, anyone who wishes to
                delve further into the responses to the consultation can access
                my Department’s web site, where they will find copies of the
                main submissions received, along with further statistical tables
                analysing the responses from the household response forms, the
                omnibus survey and the detailed response booklet.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Three key messages emerged from the
                consultation: the demand for change; the obligation to focus on
                the needs of the child as a learner; and the emerging consensus
                on key issues. The responses to the consultation demonstrate a
                clear and unequivocal demand for change. Many respondents
                acknowledged the achievements of the current system but argued
                that it was not adequate or acceptable for the future. They
                criticised the current arrangements as unfair and failing to
                meet adequately the needs of learners. They pointed to the
                skewing of the primary school curriculum in favour of preparing
                children for the transfer test and to the detrimental and
                stressful impact that it has on children with the damage to
                their self-esteem and the creation of more losers than winners.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They argued that the current system
                perpetuates social and class divisions and militates against
                equality of opportunity — particularly for those from
                disadvantaged backgrounds. There was also a widespread view that
                the system is inflexible and does not recognise the differing
                needs of children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Almost all responses to the consultation
                supported the abolition of the transfer test. Those who wish to
                retain academic selection also accepted that the transfer test
                and associated coaching are unsatisfactory and that change is
                needed. There is widespread dissatisfaction with the current
                post-primary arrangements. The feeling is that they do not meet
                the needs of children and are not adequate for our society and
                economy in the twenty-first century. There must be change, and
                the status quo is not an option.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second message arising from the
                consultation is the obligation on all of us to focus on the
                needs of the child as a learner. Human rights and equality
                obligations demand that the rights of the child are taken fully
                into account in the post-primary review and that the links
                between education and other human rights are reinforced. There
                was almost universal support for the guiding principles proposed
                by the review body, and particularly for the first two. They
                stated that each young person should be valued equally and that
                all young people should be enabled to develop their talents to
                the full.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a widespread view among the main
                education partners that the prime focus must be on the needs of
                the child as a learner. Children develop at different rates and
                have a wide range of talents, aptitudes and learning abilities.
                A consistent theme in comments about future arrangements was
                that they should ensure that education provision meets the needs
                of individual pupils. Society and the economy in the
                twenty-first century require a broader range of knowledge and
                skills than in the last century, and new post-primary
                arrangements must offer a wide range of curricular options,
                promote parity of esteem for all curricular choices and pathways
                and provide flexibility between them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third message arising from the
                consultation is that there is an emerging consensus on key
                issues, including the problems of the current system and the
                changes that are needed. In some quarters the debate has been
                crudely and inaccurately presented as one between two clearly
                opposing camps. The reality is very different. It is clear from
                the responses to the consultation that there are significant
                areas of consensus. In other areas there is agreement over the
                aims and desired outcomes, but differences over how they can be
                best realised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While there was little support in the
                consultation for the review body’s model in its entirety,
                varying degrees of support were expressed for individual
                recommendations. There was a strong consensus on a number of the
                review body’s proposals, including the guiding principles, the
                abolition of the transfer test, the development of a pupil
                profile — although views differed on what that should contain
                and how it should be used — and the need for greater
                co-operation and collaboration among schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The predominant view was that academic
                selection should be ended, although some support for this
                proposal was subject to certain conditions being met. Most of
                those closely involved in education, the education partners,
                primary and secondary schools and the churches, supported the
                ending of academic selection. However, there was also
                substantial opposition to this proposal, particularly from the
                grammar school sector and the majority of those responding to
                the household response form.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was little support for two of the
                proposed admissions criteria, proximity to the pupil’s home
                and having a parent on the teaching staff of the school, and for
                collegiates as proposed in the review body’s report. The
                consultation has demonstrated consensus on the need for a common
                curriculum to age 14 and for 14 years as a more appropriate age
                for parents and pupils to consider and make choices about the
                curricular options or pathways that best suit the interests,
                needs and abilities of the young people. There was agreement
                that new arrangements should offer flexibility on curricular
                choice and be able to accommodate changes of direction by young
                people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many responses also argued for a range of
                approaches so that post-primary arrangements could reflect local
                needs and circumstances. Throughout the review I have
                consistently said that I want to build consensus about the new
                arrangements. Building consensus remains the best way in which
                to make progress, and the considerable consensus demonstrated by
                the responses to the consultation provides a sound platform from
                which to move the review forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want now to turn to the transfer test. The
                consultation has clearly shown that there is overwhelming
                support for the abolition of the test, and that requires a
                positive response. There are those who fear that the Department
                will move too quickly; others fear that we will move too slowly.
                I am aware that many parents are anxious about the possible
                effects of change on their children. However, there will be no
                chaos in the education system, nor will children suffer as
                guinea pigs during transition to new arrangements. Change will
                be implemented in a considered, planned manner, which will lead
                to real improvement in our education system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current arrangements, including the
                transfer test, must remain in place until decisions are taken on
                the post-primary review. The existing system must be managed,
                and the education of children currently in schools must be
                protected while the Department plans new arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review body suggested that ending the
                transfer test in 2002 would be the earliest date on which
                changes could be introduced, and that would be subject to the
                outcome of the consultation process that the Department has just
                completed. To ensure that schools, parents and pupils know where
                they stand, I can confirm that the transfer test will take place
                in November 2003. Those pupils who are currently in primary six
                will, therefore, sit the test next year, and they will transfer
                to post-primary education in September 2004 under the current
                arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the transfer test must be held next
                year for practical reasons, I make it clear to the Assembly and
                to the people that it has no place in the future of education
                here. I am firmly resolved that it shall be abolished. It is
                unfair and damaging to many pupils, and it has adversely
                affected too many young lives. The consultation has confirmed
                the overwhelming support for its abolition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout its history the 11-plus branded
                most of our children failures: the real failure was not the
                children but the 11-plus itself. That injustice must be brought
                to an end. I am, therefore, announcing today that the transfer
                test will be abolished. I am determined that this will happen as
                soon as is practical, and my proposals for the way forward will
                ensure that the 11-plus is consigned to history at the earliest
                possible date.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That brings me to the next stages of the
                review. It is important that everyone, including myself, takes
                time to consider the responses to the consultation process in
                detail. I want to hear the views of key stakeholders in
                education on the responses to the consultation, and, in the
                light of my decision on the transfer test, on how best to
                progress the post-primary review before I introduce my proposals
                on the next steps. Any new arrangements and their implementation
                must be shaped by the responses to the consultation and must
                build on emerging consensus.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The views of MLAs are important in the
                process. I have tabled a motion to enable the Assembly to take
                note of the publication of the consultation report: that motion
                will be debated here next Tuesday. I had intended to discuss the
                report with the Committee for Education on Thursday, but that
                will be rearranged as early as possible. I look forward to both
                discussions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our main education partners must be fully
                engaged in the process of developing and implementing proposals
                for new post-primary arrangements. That is crucial. I have,
                therefore, planned a series of meetings with key education
                interests to seek their views on the responses to the
                consultation process and on how best to take forward the next
                stages of the review. Those meetings will take place with the
                education and library boards, the Council for Catholic
                Maintained Schools, the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated
                Education, Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta (the Council for
                Irish-Medium Education), the Governing Bodies Association of
                Voluntary Grammar Schools, the teachers’ unions, the Council
                for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment, the Northern
                Catholic bishops, and the Transferor Representatives’ Council,
                representing the main Protestant churches.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first meeting has been arranged for 5
                November, and meetings will continue throughout November. In
                determining the way forward, I will carefully consider the views
                expressed by our education partners at those meetings, along
                with the views of the Assembly and the Committee for Education
                and the responses to the consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will announce my proposals for the next
                stages of the review in December this year.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My objective in advancing the post-primary
                review is to create an education system that raises standards
                for all pupils, is fair to all pupils, and provides a modern
                education system for the twenty-first century. The consultation
                provided three key messages: there is widespread demand for
                change, which cannot be ignored; there is an obligation on all
                of us to focus on the needs of the child as a learner, which
                must be paramount in considering future arrangements; and there
                is emerging consensus on key issues, which provides us with a
                platform on which to build new arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we keep the focus on the needs of children
                as learners, we can build on emerging consensus to achieve the
                objective of creating a modern, fair education system that
                enables all young people to fulfil their potential, irrespective
                of their backgrounds or circumstances. That is a truly worthy
                objective, and I will work towards it with the help of our
                education partners, Assembly Members and the Committee for
                Education as we take the post-primary education review to the
                next stages.</p>

                important discussion on the publication of the responses to

                wishes everyone to participate in the discussion, Members ought
                to have been given the opportunity to read those documents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an opportunity to question the
                Minister, and the Committee for Education wishes to consider the

                will meet the Committee to examine the outcome of the review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister confirm that the topic of
                discussion with key stakeholders will be the results of the
                consultation rather than proposals on the way forward? Does he
                intend to consult further on any proposals for the way forward?
                Will he make a commitment to bring any proposals to the
                Committee for consideration? Does he acknowledge that the Burns
                Report’s proposals are not acceptable as a way forward? When
                the Minister issued the household response form, he said —</p>

                be abolished. Will the Minister accept that the majority of

                the Member has referred, he will appreciate that this is
                time-wasting. I am aware that the Chairperson has put five
                questions, and it is important that the Minister be given the
                opportunity, which he has requested, to respond to them.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I consider the next stage of this process
                very important indeed. At the beginning of the process many
                people — not officials in my Department — said to me that
                the house would come down on top of me like a tonne of bricks if
                I tried to deal with the 11-plus. We moved through a process of
                research conducted by two eminent professors. The review body
                chaired by Gerry Burns carried out an incredible amount of work,
                and the consultation process was of vital importance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most striking feature of that process was
                the willingness of all those involved in education, on all sides
                of the debate, to be positive and constructive on how we move
                forward. It is a mood that I should like to sustain through what
                I consider to be the next stage of the process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many MLAs will appreciate that it is better
                that we move forward in a spirit of co-operation because this is
                about children. It is about the future of all our children, not
                just my children or Danny Kennedy’s children, and we have a
                responsibility to manage the process as best we can.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In answer to Mr Kennedy’s question, I
                intend to move forward sensibly, building on the good mood in
                education to deal with the important challenges before us. I
                shall not go to the education partners in the course of my
                November deliberations with a fait accompli. I shall continue to
                build consensus; and there is a good spirit abroad to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have clearly signalled to the Assembly that
                I shall come forward with my proposals at the end of that
                process. I wish to do so in co-operation with everyone,
                including the Committee for Education, which will have an
                opportunity to discuss the report, and those issues can be dealt
                with in debate here. I shall also meet with the Committee.
                Regarding further consultation on alternatives, I must say that
                the review body and my Department have already undertaken two
                broad consultation exercises. It is now time to take the review
                forward, working closely with the education partners to develop
                proposals that will take account of all the views expressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The need for change has been firmly
                established, and the majority now wishes to see proposals for
                new post-primary arrangements. Indeed, the Committee for
                Education, in the finalisation of its report into the matter,
                accepted that change was essential. Many respondents
                acknowledged the achievements of the current system of academic
                selection but argued that it was not adequate or acceptable for
                the future. The predominant view that emerged from consultation
                was that academic selection at the age of 11 should end.</p>

                and schools. I am not prepared to do that.</p>

                partners and determine arrangements that will allow change to be

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to academic selection, it is just
                not good enough for people to select results from one strand and
                ignore everyone else’s opinions. I have been very forthright
                about this. The reality is that a majority of respondents to the
                household response form — 64% — did not support the end of
                academic selection. Those responding to the household response
                form constituted 16% of the adult population. Analysis shows
                that they included disproportionate numbers of those with
                children currently or previously at a grammar school. <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

                prosperous areas of the North. Although that is an important
                body of opinion that must be taken into account, it cannot be
                construed as representing the views of the entire public. I have
                said all along that the consultation was multi-stranded and that
                reliance should not be placed on any single strand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The public’s views were expressed in a

                representative organisations in the community and voluntary
                sectors, churches, political parties and education partners. I

                must be the central focus of our attention here. This is not
                about party political point-scoring or one-upmanship; it is
                about moving forward to face up to the challenges posed by the
                results of the consultation and by the unhappiness in society
                about the current arrangements. It is about sitting together in
                a positive and constructive spirit. That spirit exists outside
                this House, throughout the wide breadth of opinion within
                education. If that is the view, if people agree with it and are
                not prepared to challenge it, there is a huge responsibility on
                Members to add to and enhance that mood by continuing in a

                also contains strong support for many of the SDLP’s other
                suggestions, such as the development of pupil profiles. The

                always been conscious that, when examining the minutiae of the

                accept that a modern education system for the twenty-first

                available for parents and children. I remind Members that the

                to say that almost all of the responses supported the abolition
                of the transfer tests, because the tests are unfair; they are
                inappropriate to the current and future educational needs of

                be a milestone on the way to a better education for our
                children. I hope that we will have the opportunity to continue
                the consultation exercise and the debate in the Committee for
                Education and in the Assembly. It would be a dreadful indictment

                were to be suspended because of prevailing political
                circumstances. My party welcomes the Minister’s clear
                statement on transfer tests and the end of the 11-plus, and we
                will take part in the consultation to ensure that that is
                carried out as quickly as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of the late receipt of the Minister’s
                statement, my three questions relate only to the statement.
                Academic selection has already been discussed, and I appreciate
                what the Minister said. However, how will those concerns be
                directly addressed in the consultation exercise? On a practical
                level, with regard to the timetable for the end of the transfer
                tests, how will parents of children in primary 5 and primary 6
                be assured that future stress will not be placed on those
                children during the transition period?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In general, I welcome the comments at the end
                of the statement. However, I am sure that the Minister will not
                be surprised at my next question. Whatever results from the
                consultation, will specific details on addressing the needs of
                children with special educational difficulties be included in
                this fairer education system that enables all young people to
                fulfil their potential, irrespective of background or

                have said time and time again that I want to build consensus on
                the new arrangements. Meetings with key education interests will
                be held in November to discuss their views on the responses to
                the consultation and how best to take forward the next stages of
                the review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In developing the way forward, I shall
                consider carefully the comments and views expressed by our
                education partners at those meetings, together with the views of
                the Assembly and the Committee for Education, and the responses
                to the consultation. I shall announce my proposals for the next
                stage of the review in December.</p>

                children will continue to be my prime concern throughout the
                review. I said earlier — and I want it to be absolutely clear
                — that there will be no chaos in the education system. Neither
                will any children suffer as guinea pigs. Changes will be
                introduced in a planned and orderly manner to safeguard the
                education of children in school. My objective is to improve our
                children’s educational experiences and to improve standards
                for all. I shall work closely with our education partners to
                achieve that.</p>

                with another test, the response to the consultation showed

                the transfer test, and it is not my intention to replace it with
                another test that will effectively perpetuate the weaknesses in

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although we cannot pre-empt the outcome of
                next month’s meetings with the education partners, a review of
                the initial teacher-training programmes must be given serious
                consideration. We know that there will be new arrangements of
                which initial teacher training must take account.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Children from disadvantaged backgrounds
                constitute only 8% of pupils in grammar schools. The objective
                of the post-primary arrangements must be to ensure that all
                pupils, regardless of where their gifts lie, can progress and
                fulfil their full potential. I am seeking post-primary
                arrangements that provide flexible, diverse and high-quality
                choices to suit the varied needs, abilities and aptitudes of all
                our children. I passionately believe, as do most sensible
                people, that every child should be given the opportunity to
                succeed. My aim is to develop new arrangements that will address
                the weaknesses of the current system, be fair to all pupils and
                enable all pupils to fulfil their potential, irrespective of
                their background and circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current academic selection system
                disadvantages low-income children in the following ways: pupils
                from the least disadvantaged schools are almost three times more
                likely to achieve a grade A than pupils from the most
                disadvantaged schools; the proportion of pupils in grammar
                schools entitled to free school meals is only 8% and has been
                declining in the past five years; disadvantaged pupils are only
                half as likely as other children to achieve five good GCSEs,
                grades A-C; and pupils from disadvantaged Protestant areas
                benefit least from the current system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a tremendous amount of sympathy with
                Billy Hutchinson’s comments. His contribution to the debate,
                like the contributions of many other Members from all sides of
                the House, has been constructive and positive, which, as we
                continue the review, is the mood that we must capture. The
                positive mood exists in the education system. There is a good
                relationship between my Department and the education partners.
                There are difficult issues that must be faced up to, but we are
                well placed to do that. It is critical that we continue to work
                in a positive way. We must respect strongly held views from all
                sides. I have detected a strong mood of co-operation, which I
                have no doubt will carry over to the important deliberations
                that will take place in November before I bring my proposals to
                the Assembly in December.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s statement is important. It
                sends the message from the Assembly that there is an emerging
                consensus about the widespread consultation, for which I thank
                the Minister. It was good that a household survey was conducted.
                However, were its findings broken down by class? Often only
                those who have the capacity to respond to household surveys do
                so, and lower income families do not. Was that the case,
                because, if so, that may have had an impact on the findings?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the emerging consensus about the Burns
                Report, it seems that the issues we have to resolve are the
                common admissions criteria and the opposition to the collegiate
                system. Given that the issue of proximity to schools seems to
                have caused the greatest divergence of opinion, will the
                Minister tell us what he plans to do about that in the interim?
                What does he plan to do about the inequities of the school
                transport system and how will he address that issue in the long
                term?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I made it clear in a previous debate that my
                Department was working on a review of school transport. However,
                I am conscious of the points that Ms McWilliams made. There is
                no doubt that we shall have to consider the issues raised today
                as we move forward. That said, we must recognise that it would
                be wrong of me to pre-empt the outcome of our deliberations with
                our education partners next month. We shall have to see what
                transpires from them before we proceed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards Ms McWilliams’s point about
                class, we could not put all of the information about breakdown
                by class in the booklet published this morning because, had we
                done so, Members would not have been able to carry it home. As I
                said during my speech, further information is available and can
                be found on the web site.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the household response form, the
                response was much lower from people in socially disadvantaged
                areas than elsewhere. However, it is important to point out that
                we should not focus exclusively on any one strand of the
                consultation. The views of the socially disadvantaged are fully
                represented in the responses from community and voluntary groups
                as well as in those of the umbrella bodies, such as the Northern
                Ireland Council for Voluntary Action (NICVA), schools in
                disadvantaged areas, the churches, political parties and human
                rights and equality groups.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Views on the proposals for the common
                admissions criterion were mixed. Many views were expressed on
                the individual criteria, and a lottery system was the most
                commonly suggested alternative tie-breaker. We must give
                considerable thought to the outcome of the consultation, and I
                have no doubt that, as we proceed through November, we shall
                face up to the challenges that the matter holds for us all.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr K Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall reserve judgement on the report. I
                have had unfortunate experience of welcoming reports, only to
                find that the devil was in the detail. I am fascinated by the
                Minister’s crocodile tears for the people of the Shankill
                Road: I am sure they appreciate his tears given the previous
                occupations of some of his Colleagues and their nocturnal visits
                to the Shankill Road.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very concerned that the Minister has
                taken a selective approach to the statistics. It is unfortunate
                that Members received the booklet less than half an hour before
                arriving at the Chamber, and we got the Minister’s statement
                only on arrival at the Chamber Door — Members have not had an
                opportunity to dissect the documentation properly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Would the Minister define the term &quot;key
                stakeholder&quot; and how that compares with &quot;educational
                partners&quot;, a term he bandies across the Chamber a lot? Who
                are the educational partners and who are the key stakeholders?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister assure the House and the
                concerned parents of Northern Ireland, who have made their
                feelings clear on some areas that the Minister has chosen almost
                to ignore this morning, that the consultation on the
                consultation will not constitute yet another attempt to skew our
                education system to suit his view of society? I heard one or two
                comments earlier in the debate that concerned me further —</p>

                of the Selective System of Secondary Education in Northern
                Ireland’ are not found in the Gallagher Report. In a letter,
                the Vice Chancellor of Queen’s University described that as
                &quot;unfortunate&quot;. It is alleged that those references
                were published, but that is incorrect. The Minister based much
                of his thinking on that first premise. If there is a suspicion
                of a flaw in the original Gallagher research, we should know
                whether that research was tested by his academic peers. Such a

                not agree that even though the so-called grammar school lobby
                was effective in mobilising its supporters to complete the
                household survey, the people have spoken clearly about the
                11-plus? That has implications for the future structures of
                post-primary education, its curriculum and assessment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is open to any group to make its views
                known on matters of major public interest. The grammar school
                campaign has a legitimate interest in this. The Governing Bodies
                Association conducted a public advertising campaign in the
                newspapers, and many grammar schools held meetings with parents
                to discuss the Burns proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was reflected in the responses to the
                household survey, which showed a higher response rate from
                parents with children attending, or who had attended, grammar
                schools than from other parents. However, that does not in any
                way invalidate the views expressed. It is clear that many of
                those parents have genuine concerns about the potential impact
                that change will have on education standards. I shall take those
                concerns into account when new arrangements are being developed.
                My objective is to raise standards for all pupils.</p>

                not yet be aware of the report, that 579 responses — 510 from
                schools and 69 from further and higher education institutes,
                community groups and training organisations — expressed a wish
                to see an end to academic selection.</p>

                selection, one sees that 62% of the teachers surveyed favoured
                retaining it. A figure that has not been quoted, and which is

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The energy scene in Northern Ireland has
                changed considerably in the last decade, and the pace of change
                shows no sign of slowing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next decade will bring a further raft of
                changes: EU Directives will require full market opening in
                electricity and gas; the gas networks will be substantially
                developed outside the Greater Belfast area; and the new
                North/South gas interconnection will be developed. There are
                associated developments in new, modern, efficient generation
                capacity and electricity interconnection, and there is interest
                in greatly increasing the proportion of Northern Ireland’s
                energy from renewable sources.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.00</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These exciting developments will bring
                enormous opportunities to Northern Ireland, but they will also
                bring challenges. It is crucial that Northern Ireland be
                positioned to meet those challenges and to use the changes to
                get the best results for its consumers. The Energy Bill will
                help us to achieve that. The items included in the Bill have
                been identified through consultation exercises as priorities
                requiring legislation. It is my intention that the Bill will
                enable Northern Ireland to meet the immediate energy challenges
                that it is likely to face.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is more to be done, and I expect that
                further legislation will be necessary in due course. The
                Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment is developing a
                new energy strategy for Northern Ireland for the next 10 years
                or so to fulfil a Programme for Government commitment, and I
                expect that more legislation will be necessary to give effect to
                that strategy. However, the issues that have been included in
                the Energy Bill will be important in setting the framework
                within which to develop any new strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issues included in the Bill result from
                several public consultation exercises to which there were almost
                200 responses. In October 2001, the Department issued a
                consultation paper on renewable energy entitled ‘Realising the
                Potential’. Responses to the paper supported the introduction
                of an obligation on electricity suppliers to encourage further
                growth of renewable energy in Northern Ireland. I welcome the
                wholehearted endorsement of such a mechanism by the Committee
                for Enterprise, Trade and Investment and its comprehensive and
                valuable energy inquiry report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In March 2002, the Department sought a wide
                range of views on the direction of a new energy market strategy
                through the publication of ‘Towards a New Energy Market
                Strategy for Northern Ireland’. That paper sought views on
                priority energy issues requiring legislation to be taken forward
                in a Bill in the lifetime of the Assembly. Among the priorities
                that the Department identified at the time were changes to
                consumer representation arrangements, changes to the regulatory
                framework, and postalisation of gas conveyance prices. The
                Department also sought consultees’ views on other issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Accordingly, the Department developed a draft
                Energy Bill that was issued for consultation in June of this
                year along with the draft equality and regulatory impact
                assessments. The Department outlined at that time its intention
                to add to the Bill, before its introduction in the Assembly,
                provisions enabling the restructuring of energy business
                activities to enable Northern Ireland to meet European
                obligations and to allow full market opening to proceed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In setting a new regulatory framework and
                introducing changes to the consumer representation arrangements,
                the Energy Bill moves the consumer — particularly the
                vulnerable consumer — to the centre of the energy agenda.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clauses 1 to 6 and schedule 1 create a new
                Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation. This will
                bring energy, electricity and gas regulation together in
                Northern Ireland for the first time, and it will allow the
                authority to take account of the interests of consumers of gas
                when considering electricity issues and vice versa. This
                important change removes the artificial distinction between the
                two industries, reflecting the closer relationship between the
                sectors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The authority structure is modelled on the
                structures in Great Britain under the Utilities Act 2000, but it
                is my intention that the Northern Ireland authority should be
                tailored to the needs of Northern Ireland. It has been given a
                name that reflects its distinctiveness. The Northern Ireland
                authority should not require many members; rather, members
                should be required to bring to matters of regulation their
                experience and expertise in relevant energy areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I intend that the present regulator, Douglas
                McIldoon, will become chairman, and the Department will liaise
                with him before appointing other members. The Bill also enables
                the authority to co-operate with persons in other member states.
                This provision is aimed at increasing North/South co-operation
                on all-island issues but will also enable the authority to
                explore wider European issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clauses 7 and 8 bring responsibility for
                energy consumer representation issues together under the remit
                of the General Consumer Council for Northern Ireland. I
                announced my intention to reform energy consumer representation
                matters in this way in August 2001, and the Committee for
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment supported that approach in its
                energy report. Like the Committee, I believe that consumers will
                be best served by having a single point of contact for advice
                and information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In consequence of the new arrangements, the
                Bill abolishes the Northern Ireland Consumer Committee for
                Electricity. I commend that committee for its sterling work on
                behalf of electricity consumers and for the dedication of its
                members and chairperson. The General Consumer Council for
                Northern Ireland will continue to build on that work, and the
                enhanced powers under the Bill will enable the council to be a
                strong voice for energy consumers in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The authority and the council will have a
                close working relationship, and clause 9 reflects that by
                requiring information flows between both organisations and
                obliging them to draw up and publish a memorandum setting out
                the arrangements for securing co-operation between them. The
                authority and the Department are given new principal objectives
                and duties in relation to electricity and gas, and they are set
                out in full in clauses 10 and 12.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The principal objectives for electricity and
                gas are different. For electricity, the principal objective is
                to protect the interest of consumers, where appropriate, by
                promoting effective competition. For gas, the principal
                objective is to promote the development and maintenance of an
                efficient, economic and co-ordinated gas industry in Northern
                Ireland. That reflects the different stages of the electricity
                and gas markets in Northern Ireland and can be contrasted with
                the position in GB, where both markets are relatively mature.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to electricity and gas, however,
                consumer issues have been moved much higher up the agenda. In
                particular, the Department and the authority, in exercising
                their duties under the Bill, are required to have regard to the
                interests of vulnerable consumers, defined as those who are
                disabled or chronically sick, of pensionable age, with low
                incomes, or, in the case of electricity, those who live in rural
                areas. Those vulnerable consumers may have particular issues
                with regard to energy, and this provision acknowledges that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part III of the Bill, which covers clauses 14
                to 25, requires the General Consumer Council for Northern
                Ireland to establish a group in connection with its
                energy-related functions. It gives the council a wide range of
                functions in relation to electricity and gas. Those include
                keeping itself informed about consumer issues and views;
                providing and publishing advice and information; and dealing
                with complaints. The council is given strengthened powers in
                relation to electricity and gas matters. It can require
                information from the new regulatory authority and from licence
                holders, and it can conduct investigations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part IV of the Bill, which covers clauses 26
                to 37, contains important new provisions creating new licences
                for electricity and gas. They position Northern Ireland to
                conform to the requirements of European Directives requiring the
                separation of energy company business activities to move to full
                market opening.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The effect of clauses 26 to 30 will be to
                enable more than one company to hold an electricity transmission
                or gas conveyance licence in a particular area. That will be
                done by allowing more than one company to carry out different
                functions in relation to the same transmission or conveyance
                assets. The different roles and functions will be specified in
                the licence conditions of the respective companies. The most
                immediate need for the provisions in the electricity sector
                relates to the desire to see the legal separation of the system
                operation activities in Northern Ireland Electricity from the
                company’s asset ownership function. Depending on the outcome
                of the present discussions on gas postalisation arrangements,
                there may be a similar need in the gas sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are additional provisions in clauses 36
                and 37, supplemented in schedule 2, to alter the scope of
                licensable activities either by making licensable activities
                that are not currently licensable, or by removing activities
                from regulatory control. The provisions give the Department
                additional flexibility to make further changes, if necessary, to
                comply with European Directives or otherwise to ensure the most
                appropriate energy market structure for Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any Orders made under those clauses would be
                subject to affirmative resolution in the Assembly. In addition,
                before an activity that is not currently licensable can be made
                to require a licence against the wishes of anyone carrying out
                that activity, the Competition Commission must indicate that it
                is against the public interest for the activity not to be
                regulated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clauses 31 and 32 of the Bill provide, among
                other things, that licence conditions may enable the application
                of a levy through an increase of the charges to a licence
                holder. I introduced those provisions primarily to ensure that
                certain costs associated with future development of the
                electricity market in Northern Ireland can be spread across all
                customers, thereby avoiding the problem of stranded costs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, there have been various
                proposals for such a levy provision in order to reduce the cost
                of capital in the energy sector. The proposition is that banks
                would take greater comfort from such a provision, which could
                guarantee a revenue stream from consumers to lenders. The banks,
                therefore, would be likely to lend at lower rates of interest.
                Those more efficient financing arrangements, it is suggested,
                could then be substituted for existing arrangements, and
                consumers would be the beneficiaries of the consequent reduction
                in repayments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I invite the proponents of such a proposal to
                consider how the provision that is included in the Bill might be
                used in developing their ideas into specific proposals, which
                must address potential state-aid issues and tax implications
                before any consumer benefit can be fully assessed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clauses 34 and 35 alter the current position
                with regard to changes to electricity and gas licences following
                a reference to the Competition Commission. The changes
                introduced by those clauses give the Competition Commission the
                final say in determining the licence modifications which should
                be made to remedy matters that the Commission has identified as
                operating against the public interest following a reference from
                the authority, thereby securing greater certainty of outcome in
                such matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The authority will still put forward its
                proposals about the appropriate modifications, but the
                Competition Commission can substitute its own, if it feels that
                they are more appropriate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Part V of the Bill, clauses 42 to 47
                strengthen the existing enforcement powers of the authority and
                give it new powers to enable it to carry out its functions
                effectively. The provisions enable the authority to impose fines
                on licensees of up to 10% of the turnover of that licensee for
                breach of licence conditions, certain statutory obligations or,
                in relation to electricity, standards of performance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been keen interest in the issue of
                renewable energy. Clauses 49 to 55 of the Bill, which constitute
                Part VI, provide the legislative basis for establishing a
                renewables obligation in Northern Ireland to stimulate the
                generation and consumption of electricity from renewable
                sources. The renewables obligation will require electricity
                suppliers to provide evidence in the form of renewable
                obligation certificates (ROCs) that they have supplied a
                specified proportion of renewable electricity to consumers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Renewables obligations exist already in
                Scotland, England and Wales. The ultimate intention is that ROCs
                should be tradable throughout the UK. That will require
                amendments to the Electricity Act 1989 in Great Britain and the
                Renewable Obligation Orders that were made under that
                legislation in Scotland, England and Wales. Contacts with
                Ministers and officials in the Department of Trade and Industry
                and the Scottish Executive are continuing with a view to
                establishing a UK-wide trading arrangement and agreeing the
                necessary legislative changes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have always been careful to point out the
                need to maintain a balance between the strong interest in
                renewables and the additional costs associated with ambitious
                targets for their development. The target for the proportion of
                electricity from renewable sources will be set in the context of
                the energy strategy that is being developed, and I will continue
                to work closely with the Committee, the new authority and the
                General Consumer Council for Northern Ireland on that matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part VII of the Bill contains several
                miscellaneous matters that I do not intend to describe in
                detail. However, clauses 56 and 57, which enable postalisation
                of gas conveyance charges, are vital elements of the Bill,
                because postalisation is absolutely necessary to enable the
                north-west, South/North gas project to go ahead. Postalisation
                will mean that the charges for conveying a therm of gas through
                designated pipelines will be the same regardless of the distance
                that it is conveyed or the number of pipelines through which it
                is conveyed.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive have endorsed postalisation,
                and introducing legislative provision in the area fulfils a
                commitment that I made to the Executive in September 2001 when
                they approved grant aid for the project. The provisions enable
                the Department to designate pipelines that are to be subject to
                the postalised charge, and allow the Department or the authority
                to modify gas licences where necessary or expedient for the
                purposes of implementing the postalisation arrangements or to
                facilitate their efficient operation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the gas companies have expressed
                concern at the postalisation provisions, which are modelled on
                provisions in the Utilities Act 2000 for bringing the new
                electricity trading arrangements into operation. I am due to
                hear those concerns first-hand later this month, and in the
                light of those discussions I shall decide if adjustments which
                do not constrain our ability to effect postalisation are
                required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 58 of the Bill will replace the
                current temporary savings provisions in section 6 of the
                Industrial Development (Northern Ireland) Act 2002. It enables
                the Department to make energy-related payments for certain
                purposes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill’s provisions will be brought into
                operation by a commencement Order, as provided for in clause 62.
                The postalisation provisions will be the exception, coming into
                operation immediately on the Bill’s enactment. Subject to
                satisfactory progress on the Bill’s Assembly stages, I would
                like the changes to the regulatory and consumer-representation
                arrangements to take effect from 1 April 2003.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The provisions in this Bill will be very
                important in enabling Northern Ireland to move forward with the
                ongoing changes to its gas and electricity sectors. I commend it
                to the Assembly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mr Neeson): </b>I welcome the
                Bill. As the Assembly is well aware, the Committee has
                demonstrated a great deal of interest in energy policy. Indeed,
                the Committee’s second very detailed inquiry was into energy,
                and we welcome the many provisions in the legislation that
                reflect the Committee’s deliberations and recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not intend to go over old ground and
                rehearse earlier debates. Suffice it to say that the Committee’s
                recommendations covered five broad areas: the cost of
                electricity; improving energy efficiency; renewable energy; the
                extension of the gas network; and the development of the
                all-island energy market. Most of those areas are covered to a
                greater or lesser extent in the detail of this very complex
                piece of legislation. Of course, the Bill also deals with other
                issues that were not in the Committee’s report, and the
                Department has agreed to consider certain matters that were in
                that report for future legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the few minutes for which I am allowed to
                speak, I hope to concentrate on the areas of concern that we
                have identified in the Bill as it stands and give a commitment
                to the Assembly that those and all areas within the Bill’s
                scope will be scrutinised in the detail that one would expect
                from a responsible Assembly Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most fundamental concern of the Committee
                is that electricity prices in Northern Ireland are still too
                high. Not only that, but a disproportionately high number of
                people experience fuel poverty. Although the question of fuel
                poverty is primarily the responsibility of the Department for
                Social Development, and tackling fuel poverty requires a
                fundamental belt-and-braces approach from across the Government,
                the Committee will scrutinise the Bill in fine detail and
                explore whether it can be amended in any way with the result of
                reducing prices for the consumer. There are ongoing
                deliberations between members of our own Committee and members
                of the Committee for Social Development to see whether a joint
                approach might be made on the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That will include giving consideration to
                whether the Department should be instructed to make provision
                for the issue of consumer bonds. The Committee believes that the
                option for such a provision should be in the Bill, and we may
                well introduce an amendment on the issue. Regardless of whether
                the Department takes such a course, we believe that the
                opportunity should be provided in the legislation. As the
                Minister said, certain organisations will meet him, and they
                will meet me soon to discuss those issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has given its full support to
                extending the gas network in Northern Ireland, which means, in
                the first instance, that the gas pipeline will be extended to
                the north-west. The Committee will closely scrutinise the Bill’s
                provisions that legislate for the postalisation of gas supplies.
                The Committee intends to confirm that proposals that are
                designed to ensure that gas costs are the same for all consumers
                mean exactly that — that those who live and work in outlying
                and disadvantaged areas pay no extra charges. That is why I
                welcome the Minister’s commitment. I am aware that he has come
                under pressure from various quarters on that, but it is an issue
                that the Committee feels very strongly about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee’s advocacy of the greater use
                of renewable energy is on record; in practice, that means the
                extensive development of wind farms. The Committee feels that
                the Department is not being ambitious enough in its attempts to
                meet the targets that were set by the Kyoto Protocol. The
                Committee will consider whether to propose amendments to the
                Bill that will enable Northern Ireland to take its rightful role
                as the pacesetter in generating renewable energy throughout
                these islands. That was reflected in the Committee’s report on
                energy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee will also examine whether the
                Department has followed the provisions of Great Britain’s
                Utilities Act 2000 too closely. There are arguments for and
                against following &quot;parity legislation&quot; word for word
                in Northern Ireland after laws have been passed at Westminster.
                However, there can be no dispute that the energy market in
                Northern Ireland is different from that in Great Britain. We
                have higher electricity prices, a greater reliance on oil, and a
                rudimentary lasting gas infrastructure. Despite the
                interconnectors, Northern Ireland’s electricity industry has
                what amounts to a monopoly on electricity supply. Is slavishly
                following Westminster legislation appropriate in those
                circumstances?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is, of course, much to be applauded in
                the Bill. Without wishing to prejudice further deliberations by
                the Committee, I can give a guarded welcome to the new Northern
                Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation and to transferring
                certain responsibilities in that field to the General Consumer
                Council for Northern Ireland. The Committee recommended that in
                its report. Although welcoming that, I can give the Assembly a
                commitment that those parts of the Bill will undergo the same
                detailed scrutiny as the more controversial areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, facilitating the establishment of an
                independent transmission system operator should be welcomed. It
                will mean that in future responsibility for the transmission of
                electricity will be divorced from responsibility for the
                generation of electricity. That removes a potential conflict of
                interests, which should benefit the consumer. The legislation
                does not detail how the transmission system operator should
                operate. The Committee will probe departmental intentions on
                that matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill is laudable legislation, which, I
                suspect, the Committee will generally support. In many ways, it
                reflects the changing nature of the energy market in Northern
                Ireland, in the island of Ireland, in the British Isles and in
                Europe. However, the Committee intends to scrutinise the
                legislation thoroughly. It has already publicly advertised for
                submissions from all interested bodies.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee
                for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, I do not intend to say
                much other than to welcome the Second Stage of the Bill. During
                its inquiry, the Committee received many written and oral
                submissions. It made many constructive visits to places that
                have renewable energy policies, such as Denmark and Brussels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee visited those places to see
                renewable energy facilities, particularly in Denmark, which has
                one of the most energy-efficient heating supply systems in the
                world due to the implementation of combined heat and power (CHP)
                technology. That was also evident during one of the Committee’s
                case study visits to Brook Hall estate at Culmore in Derry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee’s main objectives in visiting
                Denmark were to see how for example diversification, creating
                energy from waste, could be achieved; to consider a strategic
                challenge to the inequitable generation contracts, which had
                been negotiated at the time of privatisation; and to see at
                first hand the renewable energy market and its potential in the
                global market, which could make up to £1 billion a year by
                2010.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Denmark, the Committee also saw the
                operation of an offshore wind farm — a project currently under
                discussion here. The Danish wind farm was built in November 2000
                and consists of 20 2-megawatt wind turbines. It is situated just
                three kilometres outside the port of Copenhagen. The expected
                annual electricity production is 90,000 megawatt hours, which
                equals the electricity consumption of 20,000 Danish households
                and represents approximately 3% of Copenhagen’s power
                consumption. The visit illustrated to the Committee the
                advantages and disadvantages of wind energy. It will certainly
                inform part of the debate about the proposed wind farm off the
                north-west coast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The visit to Brussels provided the Committee
                with an opportunity to become more familiar with European energy
                policy within the Commission. Now that all EU Directives are
                being scrutinised much more closely, we must make ourselves
                aware of the energy policy. There have been discussions about
                burning Orimulsion at Kilroot. Seeing Orimulsion plants at first
                hand informed the Committee about what it was considering and
                whether it could recommend Orimulsion to the Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee made 45 recommendations, which
                have mainly been supported by the Minister. However, he did not
                support the first recommendation on nuclear energy. The
                Committee wants the nuclear power reprocessing plants on the
                western seaboard of Great Britain to be eventually replaced with
                sustainable energy facilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee was quite troubled by
                electricity costs and was awaiting the outcome of the Department’s
                consultation on its paper entitled ‘Towards a New Energy
                Market Strategy’. We welcome the Minister’s decision on
                licensing and the extended powers being given to the General
                Consumer Council for Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee felt that the energy efficiency
                levy should be increased to £5 per household per annum. As the
                Deputy Chairperson said, it would be used to help eradicate fuel
                poverty. There have already been discussions on that with the
                Department for Social Development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The combined cycle gas turbine electricity
                project at Coolkeeragh is now going ahead. I am glad that the
                Minister said that the postalisation of gas and electricity
                costs must be borne equally and equitably by all domestic and
                commercial consumers. Support should also be sought from the EU
                and other sources to meet the cost of current and future gas
                pipeline extensions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee wants to ensure the future of
                the all-island energy market. Of course, that requires adequate
                electricity and gas interconnector capacity, strong charging
                policies with effective regulation, and strong consumer
                protection. The Executive should investigate the possibility of
                abolishing the Government royalty tax, thus reducing the
                differential in corporation tax between the Republic of Ireland
                and Northern Ireland to enable companies to trade in a more
                equitable all-island energy market.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Deputy Chairperson said, targets for
                renewables are probably set too low. The Committee is aware of
                the considerable cost to the consumer. Having seen such measures
                in operation in Denmark, they are probably a more expensive part
                of electricity charges. However, because of the climate change
                levy, the difference in pricing between here and Great Britain,
                and the length of time it took for gas to be introduced here,
                the Committee feels that derogation should be extended. The
                Minister has given us an assurance that derogation will be
                sought for 10 years rather than the current five years, and the
                Committee welcomes that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee
                for Enterprise, Trade and Investment said, the Committee spent
                much time and energy on clause-by-clause scrutiny of the Bill to
                ensure that it will benefit all consumers in Northern Ireland. I
                welcome its introduction by the Minister and can assure him that
                we will give it an advantageous reading.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr O’Hagan:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I too will be brief. I thank the Minister and am sure that he
                would agree that, although the Committee retains its right to
                challenge and be critical of the Department and the Minister,
                our relationship with both provides a good example of how well
                partnership arrangements can work. I enjoyed working on this —
                I found it interesting. It is a shame that much of the valuable
                work done to date will now be brought down by the political
                crisis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson, the Deputy Chairperson of the
                Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment adequately
                represented many of the Committee’s views, particularly those
                on the emissions target. The Committee is broadly agreed on
                that. I will not rehash all those issues, but I want to make
                several points about the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I would like the new arrangements for
                regulation and consumer representation to include all
                perspectives on energy and to pay particular attention to
                domestic consumer representation, especially for those on low
                income and other vulnerable consumers. That may require changes
                to the process of application to the General Consumer Council or
                a change in criteria for potential members — such changes
                would not be beyond the council’s capability. I expect that
                any appointments to the General Consumer Council will adhere to
                equality principles. I would also be interested to hear a
                detailed response from the council about how it intends to
                fulfil the duties proposed in the legislation, so that we can
                assess the impact of those changes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of the fuel poor has much exercised
                the Committee and, I am sure, the Minister and the Department.
                The Minister may find it worthwhile to recognise the fuel poor
                as a distinct vulnerable group in the legislation and to make
                the necessary provision for that. The extension of the natural
                gas infrastructure should be wholeheartedly supported; so too
                the principle of a common tariff. Pricing according to location
                is an exclusive measure that will contribute to further uneven
                economic development and may contribute to the exclusion of
                those customers who could gain most from a natural gas supply
                — people on lower incomes and the fuel poor. I broadly welcome
                the Bill. At this stage, we do not know when the Committee will
                be able to scrutinise it in more detail, but I look forward to
                having the opportunity to do so. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to the Members who contributed
                to the debate. I will try to deal with the points as they arose.
                The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise Trade and
                Investment, Mr&nbsp;Neeson, expressed his concern at the high
                electricity costs. He is preaching to the converted. However,
                many of the energy measures that we have been dealing with over
                the past few years have begun to lay foundations for change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be additional competition. There
                are now North/South and east-west interconnectors for gas and
                electricity. The nature of the contracts and our high dependency
                on fuel costs, which are passed on directly to the customer,
                have been long-term problems for us. Nevertheless, after the
                regulator’s transmission and distribution review, and the
                likely substantial rise in electricity costs in the Republic,
                the differential is beginning to narrow, or at least it has been
                prevented from becoming any worse. Electricity prices in Great
                Britain are artificially low, and it will not be possible to
                sustain those prices in the distant future. The basic
                foundations for substantial change are being put in place.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr McClelland) in the
                Chair.</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney referred to the fact that the
                North/South interconnector is in place. However, we cannot trade
                fully on that interconnector. Although it has a substantial
                capacity, the Republic’s distribution network cannot yet
                handle it. Substantial investment is necessary, and we have
                pressed the authorities to examine the issue closely. The
                investment will come, but much work must be done on the
                distribution network’s infrastructure before the full benefit
                of that trade can be achieved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson referred to renewables, and he is
                correct to say that it is the responsibility of the Department
                for Social Development to introduce legislation to address fuel
                poverty issues. I support his view that there must be
                co-operation at a high level, and we must have regard to the
                definition of &quot;vulnerable consumers&quot;. Dr O’Hagan
                made that point in her contribution. &quot;Vulnerable
                consumers&quot; should cover the majority of those who are in,
                or are at risk of being in, a fuel poverty situation.
                Approximately 170,000 households in Northern Ireland come into
                that category. There is work to be done in that area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson also mentioned parity legislation,
                which is not simply carbon-copy legislation. Our consumer
                arrangements are totally different from those in Great Britain.
                He also referred to the issue of capital, as other Members have
                done in previous debates. I refer Mr Neeson and others to the
                press release I issued when I introduced the Bill. I invited
                proponents of such a proposal to consider how the provision, now
                included in the Bill, might be used to develop ideas into
                specific proposals, which would have to address potential state
                aid issues and tax implications before any consumer benefit
                could be assessed fully. I am prepared to examine that issue, as
                is the Committee. However, if we go down that road, we must
                ensure that we can identify genuine and real benefits and that
                it is not done simply because somebody thought it was a good
                idea at the time. It must benefit the consumer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members, including Dr O’Hagan,
                mentioned consumer representation arrangements. The General
                Consumer Council for Northern Ireland already represents
                consumers, and clause 14 of the Bill requires the council to
                consider the interests of consumers on low incomes. The Bill
                also obliges the council to prepare and publish a forward work
                programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr O’Hagan’s point goes to the core of
                public appointments. We know that the rules are strict,
                including the guidelines issued by Sir Leonard Peach, the former
                Commissioner for Public Appointments for Northern Ireland.
                Although one must be as fair as possible at all times, there is
                a valid point about the number of people who feel able to apply
                for jobs. The application process is tiresome and, for many, a
                daunting task. There is a question over whether someone from
                such a vulnerable background would get over the different
                hurdles, including meeting the criteria and passing the
                interviews. Such things could militate against someone from a
                vulnerable group. Undoubtedly, there is a problem. It is not,
                however, confined to the General Consumer Council; it applies to
                the whole public appointments sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In an effort to be fair to people, in my
                opinion, the pendulum has swung too far. The process is much too
                elaborate. Members debated the 11-plus earlier. Mr Deputy
                Speaker, although, given your background, you might be good at
                the 11-plus, if the rest of us were to sit the test, how many
                would pass? The hurdles that ordinary people must overcome to be
                employed in public bodies are too high and too complicated. That
                is something for all of us to consider; it is not specific to
                this case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am conscious that, in making the changes to
                representation work, we must demonstrate that those who are
                directly affected have a voice. The question is whether that can
                be achieved within the strictures of the public appointments
                process if we do not have much discretion in such matters. I am
                not sure of the answer to that question; perhaps it should be
                discussed during the Committee Stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members expressed support for the
                postalisation of the gas network, which is a critical element of
                the Bill. Without postalisation, it will not be possible to get
                the gas pipelines approved and built.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Postalisation sounds very complicated, but it
                is relatively simple. We already have postalisation for
                electricity: a unit of electricity in Belleek is the same price
                as a unit in Larne, and rightly so. If people were charged the
                true cost of conducting a unit of electricity to Belleek, it
                would be prohibitive. Similarly, postalisation of gas would
                spread potential access to such a natural resource as widely
                across the population as possible. This is the only way in which
                that can happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, the term &quot;postalisation&quot;
                is derived from the postal system. It costs the same to send a
                first-class letter from Belfast to Lisburn as it does to send a
                letter from Belfast to Plymouth or to the highlands and islands.
                The principle is that a single price transports a unit around.
                If we stray from that principle, we will encounter serious
                difficulties. We must ensure that postalisation occurs. There
                are details to be discussed on how best to introduce it, and I
                will hold discussions with interested parties in the coming
                weeks. However, I am convinced that the principle of
                postalisation is sound and that we can finalise the details as
                we progress the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While we proceed with the legislation, we
                must remember our end target. Because of the structures that we
                inherited, systems operation is done in-house by Northern
                Ireland Electricity. We want to separate that out.</p>
                <i>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any authority that may be created will not be
                huge; it will be very small, run by a handful of people. The
                existing regulator, Mr Douglas McIldoon, will chair it, and one
                or two others with particular skills and expertise may help him.
                We do not intend to create an elaborate structure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As with the General Consumer Council, we are
                removing one body and amalgamating it with others to form one
                because we want to create a one-stop shop that is a centre of
                excellence. That is no reflection of the work that the Committee
                for Enterprise, Trade and Investment has done on electricity,
                but Northern Ireland is a small place, and it makes sense to
                have all the consumer representatives and experts working under
                one body. It is not a complicated concept, but it will help.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we proceed to the next legislative stage,
                I will appreciate the support of the Committee. Renewables are
                high on its agenda. We must set a target — people think that
                we have done so already, but we have not. We are discussing
                targets through the energy strategy, and we will reach a
                conclusion. People must remember that if you set a target for
                renewables, however desirable, there is a cost. Mr Neeson began
                the debate by saying that we have high electricity costs. I want
                to see as much renewable energy as possible, but we must
                remember that there is a price to be paid.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People think that the windmills can be
                erected here, there and everywhere, that biomass can be used and
                that the more of those we have, the more renewable energy we
                have. It is not as simple as that. Wind will realistically be
                the source of over 90% of our renewable energy, but people are
                not picking up on the fact that it tends to be in remote areas
                — on mountains, at the coast and so forth. By definition, the
                distribution network in those areas is fragile because of their
                remoteness. The intermittent nature of wind energy means that
                the system cannot technically absorb large bursts of electricity
                that are followed by none. The consumer must be constantly
                supplied with electricity. If a system receives huge surges
                followed by a withdrawal of those surges, it must be replaced.
                The distribution network must be technically strengthened in
                many of those places, which will be a major cost. People must
                understand that, and that point is not coming across in the
                debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Offshore wind was mentioned, and we know that
                there is local concern about it. That is going through a
                year-long process, and we will see what is proposed at the end
                of that. Ultimately, windmills will be placed in prominent
                places, either offshore or on top of mountains. People will be
                able to see them, because that is where the wind is. Therefore,
                if we want renewable energies, and as most of it in Northern
                Ireland will come from wind, we must either decide to tolerate
                their visual impact environmentally or accept the surreptitious
                gradual erosion of our environment through the emission of CO<sub>2
                </sub>and other gases into the atmosphere. All developed
                countries must make that choice, and, in common with those
                countries, we must debate that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A difficult choice must be made, and we know
                locally that that is the sort of thing that we want in somebody
                else’s backyard but not in our own. Biomass has the advantage
                of being able to supply a constant flow of electricity; the
                supply from wind, on the other hand, is more intermittent.
                However, realistically, the potential for biomass is limited
                because of the amount of material that is available to keep the
                machines going and the likely cost. Willow and other materials
                are usable and good. The technology will improve, as will our
                performance, in time. However, that will not be done for
                nothing, and it is fine as long as everybody understands that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I thank the Committee for how
                it conducted its report into energy and for its handling of
                these matters. I look forward to working with it as it considers
                the Second Stage of the Bill. If amendments are suggested to the
                Bill, the Department and the Committee will co-operate in the
                spirit of partnership that has marked our work. We are
                endeavouring to get the best deal for the consumer and to ensure
                that our economy is as competitive as it can possibly be in
                relation to our neighbours who hitherto have had significant
                energy advantages over us.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly notes the disastrous
                situation of agriculture in Northern Ireland and urges the
                Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to establish a
                Fair Price Commission with one of its principal functions being
                to investigate the distribution of profits within the Agri-Food
                sector.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I first mooted the idea of a fair price
                commission, those who prefer inaction to action — among whom I
                am sorry to say is our own Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development — deliberately misunderstood me. They tried to
                accuse me of price fixing. They said that &quot;That cannot be
                done in a free market.&quot;; &quot;It is a reserved
                matter.&quot;; and &quot;It is not within my competence.&quot;.
                These are smokescreens for inaction and are without substance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My intention was to redress the unfairness of
                the distribution of profits in the end price of agricultural
                goods. Recently, Ben Gill, the president of the National Farmers’
                Union told the ‘Daily Telegraph’ that of an average basket
                of farm produce, containing eggs, beef, milk, bread, tomatoes
                and apples, which typically cost £37 in the shops, the farmer
                received only £11, a figure significantly less than one third
                of the end price.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly, that is an appalling and
                unsupportable situation. What additional value do food
                processors and the food retailers add to the goods produced by
                farmers? Fair-minded people would say that it certainly is not
                two thirds of the end price. Mr Gill eloquently highlighted the
                central problem, which I want a fair price commission to tackle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first task of that commission would be to
                establish the facts of the case and to weed out the apocryphal
                and completely unacceptable. Just how much goes to the end
                retailer, which, as often as not, is a supermarket chain?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once again, the president of the Farmers’
                Union, Ben Gill, put it well. He gave a simple illustration. Pig
                farmers receive 96p a kilo for their animals, yet pork retails
                at £6·97 a kilo. Somewhere between the farm and the retail
                outlet, someone makes £6·01 more than the farmer is paid for
                every kilo of pig meat. The farmer gets less than 14%; the
                processor and retailer, between them, receive some 86%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In anybody’s language, that is unfair. From
                farm to fork, it is plain that something is wrong. For years,
                the farmers’ unions have talked to supermarkets, but, as one
                would suspect, no progress has been made, for sentiment and
                money are bad companions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where the fault lies — whether the
                processor takes too much by manipulating the number of cuts that
                he pays for, or whether the supermarket chains take too much by
                using their overwhelming buying power — is not really the
                point. Wherever there is unfair practice, the facts of the case
                must be established. The only way to do that is by investigating
                the matter, using the medium of a specially established fair
                price commission. That investigation would be the primary task
                of such a commission. All we ask for is fair play — a level
                playing field. Farmers in Northern Ireland are efficient and
                have proven over the years that they are at the forefront of
                modern expertise in all sectors of farming.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commission’s second task would be to
                establish what was broadly accepted as a fair distribution of
                profits between the different sectors: the farmers, or
                producers; the processors; and the retailers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One thing must be established. As things
                stand, processors and the distributors take their profit first.
                Everybody takes their whack out of the profit. When it reaches
                the bottom of the chain, there is nothing left for the farmers.
                The whole process needs to be reversed. The farmers must get a
                fair price for what they produce, and others can follow. There
                must be an about-turn. We cannot go on in this way. This must be
                based on the real value added to the produce. This must be done
                using pre-established yardsticks. Only then will myth be
                separated from reality. We need a third-party assessment of the
                true extent of the problem, and the figures will cause public
                shock.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third part of the remit of a fair price
                commission would be to award certificates. These would appear in
                the form of labels on products in shops stating that those items
                of food were produced under circumstances in which farmers
                received a fair price. Because of price controls, the scheme
                would have to be voluntary. It would operate in the same way as
                the PONI (produce of Northern Ireland) labels. The labels would
                be similar to the labels on organic food now appearing in
                supermarkets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consumers are the next part of the equation.
                Consumer education is required. They would have to be aware that
                the fair price labels on goods meant that they were buying
                produce for which the farmers had received a fair price.
                Consumers drive supermarkets, and supermarkets will only change
                their practices if customers dictate it. Consider the example of
                organic produce. It is only by establishing such a structure
                that we will create change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ben Gill also said that talks with the
                supermarkets have dragged on for years but that they never get
                anywhere, which is true. What I propose would break the impasse.
                It is market-orientated and market-driven. The Government should
                enable the introduction of fair practice by producing a
                structure or mechanism for it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the Government’s duty. Hiding
                behind excuses is disreputable, and it leaves a bad taste,
                especially for the Department. I have every sympathy for the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development; it has many
                problems. It now has an opportunity to give a lead rather than
                resist it, and to earn the reputation of being an aid worker
                rather than being the policeman. Let it do so with good grace
                for once, instead of trying to put obstacles in the way of the
                farmers, who ultimately keep in place that enormous, £200
                million-a-year, edifice that is the Department of Agriculture
                and Rural Development, and its employees.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I read about one of the issues that currently
                concern us in the paper this past week. Italy’s Government are
                introducing a quality-control system to guarantee standards.
                They are fed up with impostors. Checks have been carried out in
                all sectors of the Department there. One of the most important
                points is that meetings continue to take place across the
                country. People are voicing their concerns at the bad prices
                being paid. Meetings are actually taking place today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All this could be avoided if the primary
                producer got a fair price for his produce. Greed is a powerful
                weapon. Will it last? There are currently 80,000 jobs directly
                or indirectly involved in the agriculture industry here. Those
                jobs must be protected and not left to the wills of unscrupulous
                people. Look what has happened to our shipbuilding industry this
                past week. Do we want that to happen to the agriculture
                industry? Not only would we like to see the shipyard back, but
                we would like to get our agriculture industry back onto a level
                footing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A farmer told me last week that working on
                his farm was like working in a concentration camp, as all he did
                was work and sleep. Things cannot continue as they are. As the
                Committee of the Regions noted:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Since the European Union is a world
                power, it must yield its influence to ensure that the rules
                governing international trade and farm produce match its
                interests and values in keeping with this new common
                agricultural policy and must take realistic account of the
                international context arising from American unilateralism and
                seek to set up a balanced, fair system of trade with the
                developing nations.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our problems are the same as those of many
                other countries. If our farming industry is not protected, in a
                few years’ time we will have no industry. We do not want to
                finish up like the shipyard in Belfast, which used to be the
                backbone of Northern Ireland. Agriculture is currently the
                backbone of our country, and we must protect it. I tell our
                Government that we can work together to solve the problem. There
                is no point in pussyfooting about because we have major
                problems. That ties in with the weakness of the territorial
                impact analysis for the proposed measures. It is stated:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development, Ms Bríd Rodgers, to respond. My apologies,
                Minister, I see Gerry McHugh’s name on the list.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I have no difficulty understanding that anyone can mix things up
                today. The focus is on everything except the Order Paper.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for
                Agriculture and Rural Development is not in the Chamber yet. He
                purports to be very supportive of the farming community and its
                needs, but it is clear that he, and his party, are off fighting
                for their real interest, which is the demolition of anything
                that might be positive for farming here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is difficult inasmuch as one might
                ask what a fair price commission could achieve. However, I
                support the motion because anything that might help the primary
                producer or the whole industry must be supported. People might
                say that a fair price commission would support farmers. The
                debate could be widened to the point where people would have to
                realise that it involves the whole industry; not just one part
                of it. If we do not have a fair price at the producers’ end,
                as the last Member said, then we will not have an industry. It
                is as simple as that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My biggest worry is that there could be a
                situation here in the not-so-distant future in which we would
                have to import all of our raw agricultural material for
                processing and everything that consumers need. Such imports
                would raise issues about quality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage said that farmers are now in
                slavery and that the next generation will not take part in an
                industry that will not be giving them any return. There are
                precious few farmers now who can say that they are getting any
                return for their effort. No one in any other walk of life would
                put in the same effort for such a small return. The result will
                be the total meltdown of the industry. Any vision statement or
                document with a 10-year delivery span will not have a hope of
                delivering improvements. Those are the difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a few questions concerning a fair
                price commission. Would it embarrass only the processing
                industry? Would it put enough pressure on supermarkets to
                increase prices to the farmers and not just the processors? How
                would it stop the importation of inferior food from all corners
                of the world? There would be a demand for quality produce from
                imports. For example, there is the poor quality of grain coming
                through Warrenpoint. Ten per cent of that grain can contain
                anything, and it would certainly not be good enough to go into
                animal feed. We should be able to stand over the production of
                the end product.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the forecast that 50% of dairy farmers
                may go out of the business following Agenda 2000 proposals, and
                given the 15% cut in intervention prices for butter and 5% for
                milk powder, would a fair price commission have any effect on
                staving off those cuts? What effect would it have in keeping
                prices up when we are heading towards world market prices?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The World Trade Organisation and the
                Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs,
                Margaret Beckett, want to increase the cuts. They also want to
                speed up the common agricultural policy reform. They want the
                opposite to what would support the industry and its mainstay
                here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the light of those questions, where will
                we end up? Moving to world prices would mean high costs for the
                farmer, high wages, high inputs and low end prices. Could
                farmers survive? We do not have an option because of the scale
                of countries such as Brazil and New Zealand that are in straight
                competition with us. The UK policy for more drastic cuts and
                reforms works against us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had a long debate at Loughry College last
                week about the common agricultural policy reform. That puts the
                industry’s future into perspective. The principal components
                have been addressed. The Committee’s report dealt with the
                business of fair prices for farmers. I am sure that most of the
                recommendations contained in that report have yet to be
                implemented.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consumer and the primary producer are
                closely linked. What does society want? That question was asked
                during a speech last week. However, what question was society
                asked? Was it asked whether it wanted food from outside Europe?
                Does society want low-quality food that has no traceability?
                Does society want food from producers who are not required to
                adhere to the same regulations that we must follow? Is that what
                the consumer wants? Will the consumer even be able to choose
                local produce in the future?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps we should move towards localised
                markets that are free of food that has been transported many
                miles. Localised marketing offers the farmers more control.
                There is also the issue of global sustainability. Do we want
                large areas of rainforest to be wiped out in order to create
                grass that is eroded after three years? The rainforest countries
                may be poor, but they have been exploited and destroyed by
                multinationals. That is why they must do what they do. However,
                as a result, we are importing food from countries that are
                unable to produce it in the long term. We can produce food, but
                we are not allowed to produce it, and it seems that it will not
                be economically feasible to continue to do so in the near
                future. Those are the questions that we must ask.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just as the Assembly seems to be almost in
                meltdown, so is the agriculture industry. I am sure that it can
                only look on at the disgraceful attempts to bring down the only
                institutions that might have a hope of making a future for local
                farmers. British Ministers and British Government policies will
                not do that. I support the idea of a fair price commission that
                can do something to stem the low prices that primary producers
                endure. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">George Savage put his finger on it when he
                said that something is wrong somewhere. Of course there is
                something wrong somewhere. Therein lies the question. Where is
                the problem that causes such a variation between the farmgate
                price and the price that is charged in the supermarkets? I am
                sure that Mr Savage would agree that to establish a fair price
                commission would not guarantee that all would be put right and
                that the beleaguered farming community would obtain a fair price
                for its produce. Indeed, there is concern that it could turn
                into another layer of bureaucracy. At a time when the Ulster
                Farmers’ Union, through its care campaign, has been highly
                critical of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
                for being over-bureaucratic, it might well add to concern that
                we plan to create another layer of bureaucracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do we have the power to set up a fair price
                commission? We shall have to wait for the Minister’s response
                for the answer. It would be unfair to mislead the farming
                community that such a measure could be implemented if we have no
                power to do so. The issues are more complex and much more
                difficult to confront than simply setting up a fair price
                commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not to say that we should do nothing.
                The Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development addressed
                the issue on at least two occasions but failed to produce
                concrete evidence that price-fixing exists. That is not to say
                that price-fixing does not exist. Indeed, most farmers believe
                that it does. It would be wrong to believe or claim that the
                setting up of a fair price commission would provide a solution
                to what is a serious issue. I commend Mr Savage for tabling the
                motion and enabling the debate, but I do not believe that it is
                achievable or that it would be successful. However, I do not
                mean to question Mr Savage’s sincerity; he is an influential
                and important member of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural
                Development.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no denying that the farming industry
                is in crisis, but tinkering with the problem will not bring
                about the fundamental changes that the farming industry needs.
                Today is an opportunity to reflect on the work that has been
                done — for example, by the vision group and as a result of the
                encouragement given by the Minister to farmers to establish
                co-ops to improve their marketing methods and skills, to add
                value to their products and, in a range of other ways, to try to
                achieve better prices for their produce. However, that is not to
                say we should not focus on the supermarkets, which have a major
                role to play in ensuring that their source of supply is
                protected. While I agree with the sentiments expressed by Mr
                Savage, I believe that his proposal is fraught with

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and add my voice to my
                Colleague’s calls for a fair price commission, which will have
                the ultimate aim of securing a fair price for farmers’
                produce. The situation in the agriculture sector is desperate.
                Two years ago there was a mass demonstration by farmers to
                Parliament Buildings to protest at the low prices in farming.
                Today the prices are still unsustainable — and that is five
                years after the real crisis began.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why is the farming industry still on its
                knees? Farmers know why. Fat-cat processors and supermarkets are
                the culprits. They take more than their fair share of the
                profits. The need for a fair price commission is clear, and it
                was particularly highlighted in recent weeks by the Ulster
                Farmers’ Union’s campaign against rural exodus (CARE).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 26 September the Ulster Farmers’ Union
                put fresh food on sale at the farmgate price that the farmer
                receives, rather than at the supermarket retail price. One litre
                of milk cost 15p and 2·5kg of potatoes cost 22p — a 900% drop
                from the average supermarket value. That is a disgrace.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farmers have to bear the high costs of
                feeding and housing livestock. This year’s wet weather will
                add to those costs. However, farmers receive only a small return
                on their produce. Large supermarket chains have massive
                bargaining power. When a bargain is to be given to the consumer
                the farmer receives less for his product, yet the supermarkets’
                profit remains the same. Supermarkets are able to dictate the
                prices they pay to farmers for produce, and that undermines the
                notion of a fair market system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recent years large processing companies
                have gained what amounts to almost a monopoly situation by
                buying over small abattoirs. Once again, this results in low and
                unfair prices for farmers. Farmers are working an average of 70
                hours a week, and some work over 110 hours a week. Farm incomes
                are unsustainable, while supermarkets and other parties in the
                food chain continue to announce massive yearly profits. Where is
                the level playing field?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The system is not working. I support the call
                to urgently establish a fair price commission to expose how
                profits are being unfairly distributed on a massive scale. I
                also call for that commission to scrutinise profits and to
                ensure that they are shared equally.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise for not being present earlier,
                but I was attending a Business Committee meeting. Therefore, I
                have not heard the theme of the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the motion was first tabled, I obtained
                copies of the Committee’s reports on its inquiries, and also
                the document ‘Retailing in Northern Ireland — A Fair Deal
                for the Farmer?’ in which the Committee made 16
                recommendations. I imagine that Mr Savage revisited much of that
                during his remarks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that time we were awaiting the outcome of
                the Competition Commission’s inquiry. It found no evidence of
                price-rigging or collusion between retailers. Perhaps Members
                are suspicious by nature; we still thought that there might be
                something there, but the wheels that were put in motion could
                find no evidence of it, so we had to accept that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farmers are blaming part of their downward
                spiral on retailers’ charges, as their profits are not in line
                with the farmers’ profits. Farmers are working for nil profit,
                and shareholders in large multinationals would not live with
                that. We are victims of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many concerns have been expressed about
                farmers, and I ask the Committee for Agriculture and Rural
                Development to take a step back and look at where the House
                could be heading and what that would mean for the farming
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the past three or four years we have
                heard many cries from the heart about the farmers’ plight. We
                met lobby groups; we met many farmers on the steps of Stormont;
                we visited farms to hear their plight at first hand; we listened
                to farmers’ unions; and we pledged 100% support. However, any
                thought of collapse of the institutions will not back up our
                support. I ask Committee members to search their souls, in the
                interests of the industry, to see if that is what they really
                want. I will fight tooth and nail to save the institutions, in
                the interests of the farming and rural communities. Perhaps I am
                drifting slightly from the motion, but this is all interlinked.
                We want farming for the future, and a future for farming. I did
                not hear the wording of the motion, but I support it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development (Ms Rodgers):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I pay tribute to the Members from the SDLP,
                the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn Féin who have found it
                worthwhile to come to the House to debate the state of the
                agriculture industry. I regret that the Chairperson of the
                Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development and his two
                party Colleagues on the Committee have not thought it worthwhile
                to come to the debate. They purport to be concerned about the
                future of agriculture in Northern Ireland, but their actions
                have spoken louder than their words.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion calls on me to establish a fair
                price commission to examine the distribution of profits in the
                agrifood sector. I am fully aware of the many challenges that
                the agrifood sector has faced in recent years, and the impact
                that these have had on producers and the rural community. I
                spend a great deal of time in that community, and I know
                everything about it. I am not a farmer, but in the past three
                years I have learnt a great deal about the difficult situation
                in which the farmers find themselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, the problems that we have discussed
                today are not unique to Northern Ireland. Producers throughout
                the British Isles are voicing similar concerns. I agree that,
                for some time, farmers have not been achieving a reasonable
                return on their investment and labour. However, it is vital that
                goods be produced in response to consumer demand and at a price
                that others are willing to pay in order to succeed in today’s
                market environment. In so doing, buyers and sellers have a right
                to operate in a market that is free from anti-competitive
                behaviour and abuse of power.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage and other Members will be aware
                that ‘Retailing in Northern Ireland — A Fair Deal for the
                Farmer’ pointed out that excess profits do not seem to be
                generated by processors or retailers. That report was published
                as a result of research that was carried out at the behest of
                the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development. In
                addition, a report published by the UK Competition Commission
                — formerly the Office of Fair Trading — also concluded that
                retailers were not making excessive profits. Therefore, a simple
                redistribution of profit will not solve the problem, even if I
                had the power to bring that about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the Northern Ireland Act 1998, the
                regulation of anti-competitive practices and abuse of dominant
                positions in the market are reserved matters. The motion does
                not fall within the gift of this devolved Administration. It is
                asking me to do something that I do not have the power to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the light of that, we must examine other
                ways of addressing the issue. First, an integrated food chain
                must be developed so that there is clear communication of market
                demand and greater understanding of, and trust between, the
                links in the chain. Secondly, we must try to move away from
                producing under-differentiated products, which are subject to
                severe price competition. We must position ourselves elsewhere
                in the market where issues such as quality, safety, production
                methods and reliability as business partners assume greater
                prominence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In view of investigations into the
                distribution of profits in the food chain, I am not sure what
                more a fair price commission would achieve. I thank Mr Dallat
                for his comments because, as he and Mr McHugh pointed out, there
                are concerns about whether such a commission would be toothless
                and powerless to deal with the issues. Given that competition is
                a reserved matter, it would be toothless and powerless.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned that, as Mr Dallat
                pointed out, such a commission would create a further layer of
                bureaucracy for little gain. I would be the first person to be
                criticised heavily for wasting resources on useless
                administration for a toothless commission. Therefore, I remain
                unconvinced of the merits of the proposal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I took up the post of Minister of
                Agriculture and Rural Development, I recognised the need to
                develop a strategic approach. I am putting the finishing touches
                to the vision action plan. I was surprised by the accusation
                made by the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture
                and Rural Development, Mr Savage, that the Department has been
                putting obstacles in the way of farmers. Since I became
                Minister, all my endeavours have been aimed at ensuring that
                farming becomes a viable economic livelihood. However, I cannot
                achieve that overnight; it must be done strategically.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The initiative, which started over three
                years ago, will achieve real outcomes and will allow the
                industry, in partnership with Government, to address the real
                problems that it faces. I emphasise that it must be done in
                partnership with Government, because the Department alone will
                not deliver the strategy. I hope soon to announce the action
                plan for the modernisation of my Department. One purpose of the
                plan is to ensure that the interface between customers and the
                farming community is as effective as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should proceed by working together and
                focusing on the issues that are within my power as Minister.
                Nevertheless, all the links in the food chain must realise that
                they depend on one another for survival, and that they all must
                share in the profits. I am aware of, and share, the concerns of
                the farming community. Farmers are at the bottom of the food
                chain, and they cannot pass on the costs that are passed down to
                them. There must be co-operation down the chain.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr Dallat pointed out, I am anxious to
                enable that. I cannot force it, but as Minister I am most
                anxious to enable that partnership to happen, for that trust to
                be built, and to ensure that everyone in the food chain secures
                the profit that he or she deserves, and a fair share of the
                profits of the industry.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister summed up the issue in her last
                few sentences when she said that she realised that there was a
                problem — that problem must be resolved. She said that she may
                not have the power, but at least she has the power of persuasion
                in her Department. That can be a mighty tool if used properly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all know that I would not move such a
                motion unnecessarily. I thank all the Members for taking the
                time to show an interest in what is happening in the agrisector,
                for the problem is real. It is hard for milk producers, for
                example, to see their product in a supermarket selling at double
                or treble the price that they got for it. That is not on. I do
                not know what we can do to resolve the problem, but I know one
                thing for sure — farmers cannot continue to produce for
                nothing. They are quite happy to produce if they receive a
                reasonable return, but there is a certain pride in the farming
                community. They have worked and cut back. Northern Ireland
                farmers are as efficient as any in Europe, and yet we are being
                ripped off right, left and centre. As soon as beef or milk
                leaves farmers’ yards, the gulls are ready to dive for the
                profits. They all live off the farmer, and he receives nothing
                in return.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation is beyond belief. As we discuss
                the issue, another meeting is taking place on the other side of
                Belfast. A few things could solve the whole problem — an extra
                3p or 4p a litre on milk; 3p or 4p a dozen on eggs; and the same
                sum on pigs. It all boils down to greed. We should not pussyfoot
                around; we should call it for what it is.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must sort out the matter. I do not know
                how that is to be done, but one thing is certain: if those
                people cannot get their act together, there will be no farmers
                left. I do not want to see the agriculture industry going the
                way of the shipyard in Belfast.</p>
