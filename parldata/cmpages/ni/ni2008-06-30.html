	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. At the conclusion of last week&rsquo;s debate on  Irish-medium education, Mr McCausland gave the winding-up speech. He implied  that a Dr R&eacute;ama&iacute; Mathers was, or had been, associated with a paramilitary  organisation. In the meantime, Dr Mathers has contacted me and asked me to  raise the issue with you. He asks that you investigate the matter, with a view  to correcting the Official Report.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask that you give the matter your urgent attention, as Dr  Mathers considers that the remark could be detrimental to his personal security  and to that of his family.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mr Bradley has raised two issues. First, Members do have privilege in the  House. That privilege goes only so far in certain issues; however, in this  issue, the Member concerned does have privilege.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, Mr Bradley does not have a right of reply on that  particular issue. I will look into the issue further and report to the House or  by letter to Mr Bradley.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council &mdash; <br>
	        Trade and Business Development Sectoral Meeting</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development  that she wishes to make a statement regarding the North/South Ministerial  Council (NSMC) trade and business development sectoral meeting. Before  proceeding, I advise Members that I understand that neither this statement, nor  the next that the Minister will deliver today, relates to agricultural or rural  development matters. I remind Members again that the questions that follow the  statement must relate to its subject matter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minster of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. In compliance with section 52 of the Northern Ireland Act  1998, I wish to give the following report on the meeting of the North/South  Ministerial Council in the trade and business develop&shy;ment sectoral format,  which was held in Enniskillen on 29 May 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive were represented by Minister Nigel Dodds in  his capacity as Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and by myself, as  an accompanying Minister. The Irish Government were represented by Miche&aacute;l  Martin TD, Minister for Foreign Affairs, and by Dr Jimmy Devins TD, Minister of  State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department  of Education and Science. The statement has been agreed by Minister Dodds, and  I am making it on behalf of us both.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council welcomed the appointment of the new board of  InterTradeIreland, including its chairperson, Dr David Dobbin. Dr Dobbin and  the chief executive of InterTradeIreland presented a progress report on the  work that has been carried out by the body since the previous NSMC trade and  business development sectoral meeting, which was held in June 2002.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Examples of InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s work include the recent  launch of the entrepreneurship network and masterclass programme, and in the  area of design, the organisation is scoping the potential for co-operative  initiatives that will deliver competitiveness benefits. It is also examining  co-operation with other industries and the private sector in order to explore  the potential for initiatives on environmental goods and services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the body is working with Enterprise  Ireland  and Invest NI to identify suitable projects for submission under the EU seventh  framework programme for research. It also published recently a report mapping  research and technological development centres on the island of Ireland,  and it is exploring new opportunities for the aerospace sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Ministers welcomed InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s creation of 39  North/South business networks and the provision of information, advice and  services to more than 14,500 companies. The direct participation of more than  1,300 companies in its programmes resulted in the generation of &pound;134 million &mdash;  or &euro;171 million &mdash; in trade and business development, with an additional &pound;260  million &mdash; or &euro;331 million &mdash; forecasted from ongoing programmes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the increase in cross-border trade of 19&middot;6%  between 2003 and 2006. Indeed, recent figures show that cross-border trade  increased to &euro;3&middot;1 billion in 2007. The Council also noted InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s  annual review of activities and its annual report, prior to their being placed  before the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Oireachtas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council approved InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s 2008-2010  corporate plan and noted its two core strategic goals. Those are: first, to  generate business values by enhancing company competitiveness and capability  through co-operative North/South initiatives; and secondly, to improve the  competitive environment for mutual benefit through co-operative policy  research, reports and networks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council supported the priority that InterTradeIreland  will give to science, technology and innovation in its corporate plan and noted  the targets that were identified in the 2008 business plan. First, a total of  &pound;47 million &mdash; or &euro;69 million &mdash; in reported trade and business development  activity will be generated by the North/South business networks of  InterTradeIreland and by firms that are engaged in its projects. Secondly, 400  firms will become actively involved in developing the competitiveness of their  businesses through the utilisation of the resources of InterTradeIreland, which  are offered through its co-operative North/South initiatives. Thirdly, 2,000  firms will develop their business capabilities through the utilisation both of  InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s information and knowledge services resources and 25  North/South co-operative business and economic networks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council agreed that the next meeting in trade and  business development sectoral format would take place in September or October  2008. Go raibh m&iacute;le miath agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (Mr Durkan)</strong>: There is something of a presentational  oddness about the accompanying Minister making a statement in this manner. I,  as Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, have not been given any reason or briefing as to why the  statement was made in such a way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not in any way criticising the Minister who made the  statement. I want my concern recorded in order that that oddness does not pass  without comment, which would enable the practice to be cited as a precedent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister and her ministerial colleagues for  their work in the meeting. On behalf of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, I join her  in complimenting the new board and new chairperson of InterTradeIreland for  their work. The Committee also appreciates and commends the previous board&rsquo;s  work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister elaborate on the potential for initiatives  on environmental goods and services, and how far those will complement  InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s work to improve co-operative policy research North and  South? Issues such as climate change, renewable energy and waste management  present business opportunities as well as challenges for public-sector  expenditure.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Will you confirm whether this is the first  time that a Minister who has not headed up a particular Department has made a  statement to the Assembly on behalf of that Department?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I am not sure, Lord Morrow. However, it is in order for the Minister to make  the statement. The Executive may select whom they wish to make a statement on  their behalf to the House.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I am relieved that Mr Durkan was not  being personal when he commented on the present&shy;ational oddness of my making  the statement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As accompanying Minister at the NSMC meeting, I did not  expect to deliver the statement either. The subsequent ministerial reshuffle  means that the lead Minister is no longer in post. Therefore, it was considered  appropriate that a Minister who attended the meeting deliver the statement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It was the first sectoral meeting on InterTradeIreland  since 2002, so much of it was taken up with discussing the progress report in  detail and work that had been done to date. That a great deal of other business  had to be conducted meant that no detailed discussion on environmental issues  took place. With the Member&rsquo;s permission, I will forward his question to  officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) and ask  the Minister to respond to it in writing.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I am almost dumbstruck by your initial ruling that the statement does not deal  with an agricultural matter, which means that I am unable to ask questions  about Comber potatoes or other local produce.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I noted with interest the positive section in the  Minister&rsquo;s statement about an increase of almost 20% in cross-border trade  between 2003 and 2006. The Minister may not have the figures to hand, but will  she provide a breakdown of that increase, including how much of it benefits Northern Ireland companies that sell to the Irish Republic?  Furthermore, has any assessment been made of the proportion of that increase  that is directly attributable to InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s work, rather than to  organic growth, which would have happened anyway?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I  do not have the figures that he requested. However, since 2002,  InterTradeIreland has developed and rolled out a series of programmes and  initiatives in accordance with its corporate and annual business plan.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In particular, between 2003 and 2007, the organisation  created 39 new North/South business networks and engaged with more than 14,500  companies, to which it provided information, advice and services. That would  not have been the case without InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s hard work and dedication. It  has also improved the range and effectiveness of its portfolio of trade and  business-development programmes in the areas of science, technology and  innovation, sales and marketing, and business capability.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I apologise for being unable to quantify the number from  the North, but more than 1,300 companies that participated directly in  InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s programmes have generated trade and business worth more  than &pound;134&middot;5 million &mdash; &euro;171 million &mdash; with an additional forecast of &pound;260  million, or &euro;331&middot;2 million. Therefore, that body has done a huge amount of work  in the space of four years. That is a significant achievement that gives us  great encouragement for those business links being developed for the future.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I also thank the Minister for her  statement. The statement mentions:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;exploring new opportunities for the aerospace  sector&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">Will the Minister comment further  on that? What potential does the aerospace sector offer for the island of Ireland as a whole?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: As I say, we did not go into a great  amount of detail. InterTradeIreland has considered the aerospace sector, but,  primarily, Invest NI should deal with that matter. Therefore, I do not have  enough detail to be able to respond to the Member&rsquo;s question. At the trade and  business sectoral meeting, there was no specific discussion about Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s  role in the aerospace sector or Invest NI&rsquo;s plans and projects. However, we are  happy to respond to the Member in writing.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Like other Members, I find it very strange to be told that an accompanying  Minister will present a report but may not be able to answer Members&rsquo;  questions. Nevertheless, I will proceed with my question.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The statement mentions &pound;134 million of cross-border trade,  with a further &pound;260 million anticipated. First, will the Minister clarify the  time periods to which those amounts refer? Secondly, does the Minister agree  that what is more significant to the economy in Northern Ireland is not  cross-border trade but how that trade may help businesses here to improve their  efficiency when they export to Great Britain, Europe and the rest of the world?  Will the Minister give more detail on that issue?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The fact that I may be unable to answer  Members&rsquo; questions is less to do with my being the accompanying Minister than  the fact that the sectoral meeting was dealing with four years&rsquo; worth of work,  and, therefore, there was not much time to go into the minutiae of the work  that had been done over that period of time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s vision is of a globally competitive  enterprise environment in which Ireland,  North and South, co-operate to ensure the optimal utilisation of economic  resources &mdash; particularly knowledge resources &mdash; to drive additional trade and  wealth creation. Its mission is to enhance the global competitiveness of the  economics of both jurisdictions for mutual benefit through collaborative  business, policy and research programmes as well as partnerships and networks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">From the figures, we can see that InterTradeIreland has  been very successful in a short period of time and is continuing with its  efforts to ensure that we are punching above our weight and achieving economic  development across the island. That body will continue its work on economic and  policy research to identify co-operative actions that will lead to mutual  benefit. As I have said, the target areas will include science, technology and  innovation, infrastructure, enterprise and business development, labour market  and skills, trade and investment and the regulatory environment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are several key performance indicators for 2008-2010,  such as the business value generated through InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s initiatives,  the number of firms engaged in InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s initiatives and the number  of trade and business development networks supported by InterTradeIreland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  welcome the continued work of InterTradeIreland, an organisation that, at  times, did not have the full support of all Members of the Assembly. I also  welcome the increase in cross-border trade. Does the Minister agree that, if  that aspect is to continue to grow, it is important that infrastructure &mdash; that  is, roads and rail services, particularly on this side of the border &mdash; is  improved?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: That is absolutely essential, and  InterTradeIreland has produced research that maps the correlation between the  level of job creation and business development in different areas with the  location of the major arterial routes across the island of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those pieces of research provide the stark message that  where there are roads, there will be business creation and development. The  Minister for Regional Development recognises the importance of those arterial  routes in the encouragement of business creation and development.  InterTradeIreland will work closely with other agencies to develop the support  that they can offer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Roads infrastructure is crucial, as is technology infrastructure.  The difficulties with broadband provision in rural areas, for example, are well  documented. There are limitations to what InterTradeIreland can do, but it has  done excellent work with the resources and time that are available to it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the Minister explain why the  meeting that she attended was the only meeting of the North/South Ministerial  Council in that sectoral format since the restoration of the Assembly? Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I do not understand that question. It  was the first meeting of InterTradeIreland since devolution. I do not know why  it took so long before the meeting was held, but I was glad to attend it and I  recognise the importance of InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s work in the development of  business and economic links across the island of Ireland.  The meeting in May was welcome and, because another one is scheduled for  September or October, the work of the body is progressing and being taken  seriously by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  The second report by Sir David Varney, &lsquo;Review of the Competitiveness of  Northern Ireland&rsquo;, refers to &lsquo;The comprehensive study on the all-island  economy&rsquo;, which is a North/South intergovernmental document that was published  in 2006. The Varney II report proposes that the programme of work that is  detailed in that document be intensified across eight areas and that that study  be updated. That recommen&shy;dation is very important. Was it discussed at the meeting,  and how will that proposal be advanced in the trade and business development  sectoral meetings?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Given that the meeting was a stocktake  of the progress that was made in the past four years, it did not go into that  level of detail.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  Mr Speaker, you said from the outset that the report makes no reference to  agriculture. However, given the importance of agricultural trade on the island of Ireland, why was it omitted from the  agenda of the meeting, and will the Minister provide an assurance that it will  be on the agenda of the next meeting in September or October?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The Member will be disappointed to learn  that I have a substantial answer to that question. Several months ago,  InterTradeIreland indicated its enthusiasm to fund a study of the agrifood  sector throughout the island. In recent years, the agrifood sector has been the  subject of intense examination in the North. InterTradeIreland identified a  shortage of information about the networking possibilities in the sector and,  prompted by the Confederation of British Industry and the Irish business and  Employers Confederation in the South, felt that such a study would be valuable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Officials are content, and new terms of reference have been  accepted. The proposed study offers potential benefits to a very important sector  in both jurisdictions. Therefore, I am pleased to say that InterTradeIreland is  advancing that study and the group will be supported by an industry advisory  panel comprising representatives from the local agrifood industry.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council &mdash; &nbsp;Tourism Sectoral Meeting</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development  that she wishes to make a statement regarding the North/South Ministerial  Council tourism sectoral meeting.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. I am not sure whether Members want me to proceed, but I will  carry on regardless.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to make a statement in compliance with section 52 of  the NI Act 1998 regarding the recent meeting of the North/South Ministerial  Council in tourism sectoral format. The meeting was held in Enniskillen on 29  May 2008. The Executive were represented by the then Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, Mr Nigel Dodds MP MLA and myself. Martin Cullen TD,  Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, represented the Irish Government. This  statement has been agreed with Nigel Dodds, and I make it on behalf of both of  us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council welcomed the appointment of the new board of Tourism  Ireland,  including the chairperson, Mr Hugh Friel. It considered a report from Mr Friel  on the work of the Tourism Ireland board since the previous NSMC meeting in  tourism sectoral format in November 2007. The Council noted the issues that  were raised at the three board meetings that were held in the interim and the  views of the board on the key components of competitiveness.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council also received an update from Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s chief  executive, Paul O&rsquo;Toole, on the progress in implementing the Tourism Ireland  2008 business plan. An analysis of the visitor and revenue targets, including  the more challenging trading environment that has arisen from increased  economic uncertainty in some key overseas markets, was also noted.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A paper that proposed the opening of a regional hub to  manage new and developing markets, such as China  and India,  was presented. The Council noted the increasing importance of those markets for  the future growth of overseas visitors to the island of Ireland.  It welcomed Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s  proposals to open a hub office for new and developing markets, which will  enable the company to operate more effectively in the face of increasing global  competition. The Council approved an increase in Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s  staffing complement by four to enable the company to recruit the staff for the  proposed new and developing markets hub.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council considered a paper on tourism statistics that  summarised the core requirements for tourism statistics, identified actual or  potential gaps in key statistics and identified areas in which pragmatic  cross-border co-operation may play a useful and effective role in filling such  gaps. The Council noted the paper and requested that officials engage with the  relevant agencies on the issues that were identified in the paper, with a view  to reporting to the next appropriate NSMC meeting.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council agreed that the next meeting of the NSMC in  tourism sectoral format should take place in November 2008. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith  agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (Ms J McCann)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann  Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her statement. Does she have any further  information about the proposed opening of a regional hub to mange the new and  developing markets such as China  and India?  Does she know exactly where that hub will be located? Furthermore, is there a  timescale for its opening? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  The work on the hub has not yet been fully completed. Officials from the  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the Department of Arts,  Sport and Tourism are working together to agree the location of the new hub  office and the timing for its opening. I expect that work to be expedited, and  more information will be provided at a later date.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  A widely recognised weakness in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  tourism industry is the lack of visitors coming to the country from the Republic of Ireland. Indeed, that weakness has been  identified and targeted in the Tourist Board&rsquo;s draft corporate plan. Did a  discussion take place at the meeting on how we could work better with our  counterparts in the Irish Republic to attract more visitors from the South to Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Some discussion took place on attracting  visitors from nearby areas. The South of Ireland market is valuable and one  that we would like increasingly to exploit.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The main discussion was about infrastructure and how we can  best identify needs in that area. The Irish market is primarily the  responsibility of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, not Tourism Ireland Ltd;  therefore, discussion was limited. However, that sector&rsquo;s importance has been  recognised.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, especially where she mentioned managing  new and developing markets.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that Northern Ireland produces some of  the best produce in the world, while, at the same time, adhering to the most  stringent of quality standards? With that in mind, does she believe that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  agricultural wares are being marketed to the fullest potential? If not, how  does the Minister feel that that can be improved?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question.  That issue was discussed at the meeting, and we were shown some of the &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (Mr Durkan)</strong>: You were there?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Of course I was there. I think that the  Member regrets not being there. We talked about developing opportunities, the  quality of our produce and how it should be marketed.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the presentation, I noticed that the first item on a  website directed at the French market examines the food and cuisine that we  have to offer. Tourism Ireland  recognises that we should boast about the quality of our produce, which can be  used to attract people to visit. To tell the French about the standards and  quality of our cuisine is nearly like selling snow to the Eskimos. It is a  recognised and increasing part of the overall package to attract visitors and  to enhance their experience while they are here.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as an  r&aacute;iteas a rinne s&iacute;. T&aacute;imid a coinne&aacute;il gn&oacute;thach ar maidin.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for her statement. We are keeping her  busy this morning.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the effects of the credit crunch, increasing oil  prices and the generally worsening economic climate, will the Minister tell the  House how Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s  business plan intends to ensure that the tourism industry in Ireland remains  competitive in the face of those growing pressures? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Tourism Ireland recognises that a more  difficult climate exists in which to attract tourists. Although the situation  is fairly difficult in 2008, it also accepts that that will become increasingly  so in 2009 and 2010.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The business plan has estimated the 2007 visitor and  revenue out-turn figures for North and South. A total of 7&middot;739 million people  visited the South, while 1&middot;782 million people visited the North. That accounted  for &pound;2&middot;643 billion in revenue to the South and &pound;334 million to the North.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s  business plan for 2008 has set ambitious targets for challenging global trading  environments and increased global competitiveness, to which Mr Bradley  referred. It acknowledges the considerable challenges that the new market will  face in trying to influence a wide range of Asian markets. It is incumbent upon  me to congratulate Tourism Ireland  on recognising the importance of developing new markets and on the strategic  approach that it is taking to achieve that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  As the Minister knows, the people of Ireland are an island race, which,  over the centuries, has been dependent on the sea. Both the North and the South  have a rich maritime heritage, including shipbuilding, emigration, and so forth.  Will the Minister agree that an opportunity exists for North/South co-operation  to promote maritime heritage as a tourism package?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I agree that the potential exists. At  the meeting we did not go into that level of detail so I do not have any  specific information. However, certain aspects, such as the Titanic Quarter,  are being examined. That is a strong base on which to attract visitors.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. She will recognise the huge potential of  the many festivals and cultural events that the Loyal Orders organise and the  long and proud history of such events. Will the Minister outline the  discussions that took place on maximising the potential of those events and  confirm how the strategy is being evolved and developed?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The Executive have set ambitious targets  for increased visitor numbers and revenue. To achieve those we must identify  all those who might be attracted to visit the region. As we move closer to  lasting political and social stability, there should be less reluctance to  expose aspects of the recent past that might be considered sensitive or  controversial. Indeed, it must be hoped that as community tensions diminish our  international image will further improve. That should create an opportunity to  promote the diversity of tourism opportunities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although there are good reasons to promote cultural and  political tourism, it must be done within a framework of principles that enjoy  widespread acceptance. The Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment is developing proposals for such a policy framework.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The entire issue of cultural tourism should be promoted and  used. At the meeting, I made the point that, every day, visitors flock to take  photographs of the murals at the bottom of the Falls Road. People come here to  see what our past is all about, and we should not try to hide it. We welcome  the fact that people come here with an interest in political tourism because it  gets them here in the first place. They can then see what else we have to  offer. Political tourism is an important part of the strategy that is being  developed by DETI.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  What is the Minister doing to promote agritourism, particularly in the context  of the restrictive planning regime in the countryside? Will she guarantee that  the revised PPS 14 will support agritourism businesses?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Although PPS 14 was not discussed at the  meeting, the potential development opportunities in my Department&rsquo;s rural  development programme were discussed. I talked about some of the projects &mdash;  such as self-catering cottages &mdash; that were funded by my Department. Rural areas  have good tourism projects, which we want to be highlighted and promoted.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also discussed the benefits of natural-resource tourism  and the fact that the forestry sector is in my portfolio. There is the  potential for us to consider other partnerships that create more  natural-resource tourism and attract more visitors here. It dovetails nicely  with the work that the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and I are  involved in &mdash; maximising the potential for tourism right across the Six  Counties and in rural areas.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Minister mentioned that the increased economic uncertainty in some key  overseas markets was discussed. First, were the effects of fuel surcharges,  particularly on long-haul flights, discussed? Secondly, was there any  discussion about the importance of our near-at-hand market &mdash; that is, tourists  from England, Scotland and Wales?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The answer to both those questions is  yes. Tourism Ireland  noted the increasing importance of new and developing markets. We are not  unique in experiencing fuel surcharges and similar issues; those are global  phenomena that affect tourism markets across the world.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that Tourism Ireland plans to open a new hub  office indicates that it is considering new markets, because older markets that  we relied on in the past &mdash; for example, the US market &mdash; are no longer as stable  and cannot be relied on. The infrastructure must be in place to encourage  people from other parts of the world to visit. Tourism Ireland is trying to influence visits to the island of Ireland in a challenging global  environment. In such times, we agreed that it is all the more important to  adjust the emphasis on target markets while maintaining a substantive presence  in our traditional markets.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member specifically referred to tourism from Britain. It is  recognised that that British market is important for our tourism potential.  During the first half of 2008, Tourism Ireland invested more than &pound;7  million in a wide-ranging marketing programme. The budget for 2008-09 and  beyond includes provision for increased effort in the British market. It is  recognised that it is important to encourage our nearby neighbours to visit.  Numerous significant marketing campaigns have taken place in Britain to attract visitors to the island of Ireland.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Diseases of Animals Bill</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">First Stage</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: I beg to introduce the  Diseases of Animals Bill [NIA 22/07], which is a Bill to amend the Diseases of  Animals (Northern Ireland)  Order 1981, including provision for preventing the spread of disease; and for  connected purposes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Bill passed First Stage and ordered to be printed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Bill will now be printed and put on the list of future business until a  date for its Second Stage is determined.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="5"></a>Public Authorities (Reform) Bill</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Second Stage</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr G Kelly)</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Public Authorities (Reform) Bill  [NIA 19/07] be agreed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle, the Bill  contains provisions relating to certain public bodies that are the  responsibility of several Departments, but it has been co-ordinated and  introduced on behalf of the Executive by the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister. The Bill arises, in the main, from proposals for change  to several small public bodies as a result of the review of public  administration. It abolishes the Fisheries Conservancy Board (FCB) and provides  for the transfer of its functions to the Department of Culture, Arts and  Leisure (DCAL). It also abolishes the Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board  for Northern Ireland,  following which arrangements will be made by the Department for Work and  Pensions, through separate legislation, to extend the remit of the equivalent  board in Britain  to cover our interests.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to those provisions, the Bill repeals primary  legislation that is no longer required following the dissolution of the Pig  Production Development Committee, Enterprise Ulster and  Laganside Corporation. The dissolution of those bodies has already been  effected by separate subordinate legislation introduced by the relevant  Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As we will no doubt hear shortly from its Chairman, the  Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister was  briefed on the contents of the Bill prior to its introduction, and it consulted  all the other departmental Committees in view of the cross-cutting nature of  the Bill. I am grateful to all the Committees involved for their consideration  of the content of the Bill and look forward to further engagement during the  formal Committee Stage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will explain in more detail the rationale behind the  provisions that will effect the abolition of the Fisheries Conservancy Board  and the Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Fisheries Conservancy Board is an executive  non-departmental public body of the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure. It  is responsible for the conservation and protection of the salmon and inland  fisheries, other than those that fall within the responsibility of the Loughs  Agency of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission. In 2002, a review  of the Fisheries Conservancy Board concluded that, while there was a continuing  need for the functions of the board, there should be radical change in the  means of delivering them. The report recommended that the functions of the  board and those of the inland fisheries branch of the Department of Culture,  Arts and Leisure should be combined into one unit. That recommendation was  confirmed as part of the review of public administration in 2006 and endorsed  following the restoration of devolution by the Minister of Culture, Arts and  Leisure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Fisheries Conservancy Board was set up to be  financially self-sufficient and to derive an income from the sale of fishing  licences and agency work. However, now that the board can operate only with  substantial Government funding, the Assembly has already considered its future,  debating a motion calling on the Executive to abolish the Fisheries Conservancy  Board and transfer its responsibilities to the Department of Culture, Arts and  Leisure as a matter of urgency. Members considered that the board was not  fulfilling its main role of fisheries protection and was falling short of its  other responsibilities. In response, the then Minister of Culture, Arts and  Leisure explained that, although his Department had taken steps to support the operational  activates of the board, he hoped that Members would facilitate the passage of  the Public Authorities (Reform) Bill through the Assembly to allow a timely  transfer of the board&rsquo;s functions to the Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will enable the Fisheries Conservancy Board&rsquo;s  resources and expertise to be incorporated into the Department of Culture, Arts  and Leisure. Organisational restructuring has been planned, resource needs have  been assessed, and bids have been made to provide for a more integrated and  strategic conservation and protection service. The basis for the service will  remain the statutory remit outlined in the relevant legislation. In due course,  policy and strategy will be reviewed in light of priorities and emerging best  practices in fisheries management to ensure that the service is consistent with  the needs of the public.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board provides  advice to the Department for Social Development (DSD) as required on disability  living allowance and attendance allowance matters. The board does not have any  staff, assets or executive functions; its members are paid fees and expenses  for attendance at board meetings, and the Department for Social Development  provides the accommodation and secretarial support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The total cost to the Department is estimated at  approximately &pound;40,000 to &pound;50,000 per annum.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a statutory requirement for the board, which meets  four times a year, to include members with prescribed medical and professional  knowledge, a carer, and people who are themselves disabled. In practice, it has  proved very difficult to fill some of the vacancies on the board that require  medical and professional expertise so that the statutory requirements can be  met. In addition, the board&rsquo;s functions here correspond to those of the  Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board in Britain, which currently advises  the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the policy of maintaining parity in social security  matters, there is merit in consistent advice from a single, authoritative,  source being provided to both the Department for Social Development here, and  the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. A single board will also bring  the provision of advice in that area into line with the Social Security  Advisory Committee, and the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council, which provide  advice in both jurisdictions. It has therefore been agreed with the Department  for Work and Pensions that the remit of the Disability Living Allowance  Advisory Board in Britain  may be extended here, thus establishing a single board that will also advise  the Department for Social Development. Moreover, it has been agreed that the  new board will have at least one member from here, to provide a local  perspective, and to ensure that our interests are represented. Again, that will  mirror the arrangements of the Social Security Advisory Committee.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will streamline the delivery of functions  currently undertaken by the Fisheries Conservancy Board and the advisory board.  Furthermore, it will contribute &mdash; albeit in a modest way &mdash; to the reduction of  the number of public bodies currently in operation here, and I am sure that  that will be welcomed by Members. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. With regard to the general theme of  the Bill, it is very important to get this statute in place, and it is hoped  that it will remove more quangos. However, I have concerns about how we are to  ensure that there is some local input to the Disability Living Allowance  Advisory Board. Can the Minister reassure the House that there will be local  input and accessibility to the advisory board, particularly to deal with issues  involving poverty and stress-related illnesses? In England,  Scotland and Wales back-up  support is in place, whereas that support is not in place here. Decisions in  relation to disability living allowance (DLA) therefore may be taken that,  although taking circumstances into account, do not take into account that lack  of back-up support. Can the Minister reassure the House that that issue will be  considered, and that there will be local input to ensure that local  circumstances are taken into account when decisions are made regarding DLA? My  understanding is that, currently, many such decisions are taken at a distance  from local offices.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Members will note my pink tie and pink badge, which, I notice, are sported by  other Members as well. The issue of breast cancer is something that must be  addressed, and we must all support the fight against it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Bill, and recognise it as playing a vital  role in reforming and streamlining numerous Departments, by transferring the  functions of some public bodies, and dissolving others. I strongly welcome the  transfer of the functions of the Fisheries Conservancy Board to the Department  of Culture, Arts and Leisure. That will generate substantial savings to central  Government, departmental payments to the board for services received, and  grant-in-aid will no longer apply. I am pleased that the Ulster Unionist  Party&rsquo;s call for this move has been heeded. Such a shift will benefit not only  Government, but anglers and conservation groups alike, who, over the years,  have had continued problems with the Fisheries Conservancy Board.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Angling is a major sport in Northern Ireland that,  unfortunately, has been repetitively hit by pollution incidents and  mismanagement. This move will greatly improve the conservation of our inland  fish stocks, and the health of our rivers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill makes further provision for the dissolution of the  Laganside Corporation, and repeals further primary legislation. It is  essentially a tidying-up mechanism. Previous provision has been made for the  dissolution of the corporation, as it has achieved its statutory duty.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate all the people who worked for and with the  corporation, which carried out excellent work during the past 15 years to  transform Belfast&rsquo;s  riverside. Sometimes, people take that for granted, but the improvements that  have been made during the past 15 years have been nothing short of remarkable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Belfast&rsquo;s  waterfront is now unrecognisable. Its transformation has been a catalyst for  the regeneration of the entire city and the new Titanic Quarter development.  The Laganside Corporation is an excellent example of what can be achieved. A  similar model can and must be introduced for the redevelopment of the Maze  site, which is in my constituency. Members are aware that the Maze project  currently faces some difficulties. Such a scheme could be introduced for the  redevelopment of the entire site, not just for the proposed stadium. It is of  paramount importance that, at a time when the Assembly has received criticism  from Westminster  on its handling of the Maze project, it shows that it can deliver. If the  Assembly does not prove that it is competent in handling valuable assets, the  Westminster Government will reject any further demand for assets.  Unfortunately, they would be right to make such a rejection.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. It is important that the Member&rsquo;s remarks stick to the Bill&rsquo;s contents  and remit. They have gone slightly beyond that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker, for your direction. Of course, I will try to keep to  that. I will conclude my remarks by pointing out that the Bill makes further  provision for the abolishment of the Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board.  That will bring Northern Ireland  into line with the rest of the UK.  My party supports the Bill&rsquo;s provision for the winding up of the pig production  development committee. It also makes further provision for the dissolution of Enterprise Ulster.  The Ulster Unionist Party welcomes those moves and supports the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Perhaps the Minister will inform the House how much money will be saved to the  public purse by the reduction in the number of quangos.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the transfer of the  Fisheries Conservancy Board&rsquo;s functions to the Department of Culture, Arts and  Leisure. That said, I want simply to put on record concerns that the FCB  brought to the attention of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is concern about the criminal proceedings involving  fish kills that will not have reached conclusion, and about whether cases that  involve civil claims will be resolved. There is also concern about the  potential loss of the considerable expertise in fishing legislation that  solicitors&rsquo; firms have built up when, after a prosecution file has been  prepared by FCB, alleged fisheries offences are prosecuted through the court,  and the lack of knowledge about whether the Department will continue to  undertake functions such as the provision of a bailiffing service and support  to angling clubs in the training of private-water bailiffs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are some of the concerns that were raised by the FCB  to the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee. I want to put them on record and to  support comments that were made earlier in the debate by my colleague Mr  Molloy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Although I broadly welcome the Bill, I want to raise a few points and questions  from the Alliance Party&rsquo;s perspective. There is concern about the delay in the  process. This is yet another Bill that has emerged from decisions that relate  to the review of public administration (RPA), which were announced in autumn 2005  with respect to health and education, and in March 2006 with respect to a list  of various quangos and boards. Similarly, there is concern about the Bill&rsquo;s  breadth as regards that list. I appreciate that, at that time, the Secretary of  State indicated that 81 boards and quangos were under consideration. Certain  changes, such as those that were made to Land and Property Services (LPS) and  the Driver and Vehicle Agency, have already come into effect. There are  questions about whether OFMDFM and, indeed, all of the Executive have been  comprehensive in their consideration of the entire list.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It would be useful if the junior Minister were able to set  out the work that still needs to be done in following up on that decision or  whether the Executive have taken different views from those that were inherited  from the Secretary of State.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot resist making the point that, in that statement,  the Secretary of State looked forward to the creation of an independent  environmental protection agency. He saw that as being the inevitable outcome of  the review of environmental governance that was being established. It is worth  noting formally that that is not part of the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill proposes a UK-wide approach to DLA. The Alliance  Party supports that, but it is important that the House is clear that to  support the Bill will further entrench parity in social security provision on a  UK-wide basis. At times, comments have been made from the Floor of the House  about trying to do things differently with regard to social security. It is  important that, as a body, we talk through and resolve exactly what we want to  do on that important issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For my part, parity has been an important aspect of social  security provision across the United    Kingdom since the late 1940s. Social  security is formally devolved to the Assembly, but, given our society&rsquo;s  relevant dependency and the number of people who receive benefits, it is in the  interests of the people of Northern    Ireland not only to retain but to further  entrench the principle of parity. It is important that the parties,  particularly those on the Executive, take a collective view on where we are  heading on the issue of parity and that we do not continue to send out mixed  messages. I am sure that the Minister for Social Development will concur with  that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Undoubtedly, the Committee will have detailed comments to  make, which I look forward to hearing. The Alliance Party is broadly supportive  of the legislation, but we note that it is an extremely limited piece of  legislation that has been brought forward after considerable delay. We are not  sure what the justification for that delay has been.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  too welcome the Bill. I am sure that the Minister will accept that angling is a  critical part of the developing tourism industry. Has the enormous power that  has been held by absentee landlords since 1604 been addressed? Will that be a  critical element in the development of tourism and angling in the future?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for the Office  of the First Minister and deputy First Minister <strong>(Mrs Long)</strong>: As the Chairman of the Committee is unable to be  present, I respond to the Second Stage of the Public Authorities (Reform) Bill  on behalf of the Committee.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 12 March 2008, the Committee for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister was briefed by OFMDFM on the proposals for  the draft Public Authorities (Reform) Bill. The proposals for the Bill had been  subject to public consultation in January 2007. It was originally proposed that  the Bill would make changes to a small number of public bodies, either through  dissolution or a transfer of functions, and that it would remove statutory  nomination and consultation rights from several public bodies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Following public consultation, the scope of the Bill was  significantly reduced. In particular, a decision was made to retain the Housing  Council and to leave provisions for statutory nominations as they are. The  Bill, as introduced, simply seeks to transfer the functions of the Fisheries  Conservancy Board to the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and to abolish  the Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board for Northern Ireland, with its  functions being delivered by a UK-wide disability living allowance advisory  board. The Bill also includes several repeals of primary legislation, which  relate to organisations that have already been abolished, such as Enterprise Ulster,  the pig production development committee and Laganside Corporation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the Committee meeting on 12 March, members raised  several issues with officials from OFMDFM. In particular, concern was expressed  at the limited progress that has been made to reduce the number of  quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations (quangos) in Northern Ireland.  The original RPA proposals indicated that the number of quangos would be  reduced from 81 to 53. However, on 31 March 2008, the Committee was advised  that a total of eight decisions to abolish quangos had been reversed and that  decisions are pending on the abolition of another 10 quangos.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee agreed to write to the other Statutory  Committees to seek their views on the draft Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee received a response from the Committee for  Social Development about the abolition of the Disability Living Allowance  Advisory Board for Northern    Ireland. The response advised that the  Committee for Social Development was not opposed to the board&rsquo;s abolition;  however, the Committee wished to highlight its need to continue to receive  quality and timely independent expert advice about disability living allowance  and attendance allowance matters under the proposed new arrangements.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development  requested that the Committee for the Office of First Minister and deputy First  Minister seek to have provisions included in the Bill to abolish the  Agricultural Wages Board.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister considered those responses together with information from  OFMDFM on 23 April, 14 May and 18 June 2008. It noted the Committee for  Agriculture and Rural Development&rsquo;s views and forwarded them to the Office of  the First Minister and deputy First Minister. Furthermore, the Committee sought  information about the matters that it intends to explore during the Bill&rsquo;s  Committee Stage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In particular, the Committee is seeking assurances that  specific and appropriate mechanisms are in place to ensure that the UK-wide  Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board is fully aware of the Northern Ireland  perspective when it develops advice. The Committee will work with the Committee  for Social Development to ensure that the interests of people in Northern Ireland  who are in receipt of disability living allowance are fully protected.  Furthermore, in light of the decision to retain the Housing Council, the  Committee looks forward to receiving details of the more challenging remit that  is to be set for it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has ongoing concerns about matters that are  relevant to, but not directly addressed by, the Bill, and it will pursue those  matters with OFMDFM. We are still some way from delivering the reduced number  of quangos that was proposed in the review of public administration. Therefore,  the Committee has requested details of the cost-benefit analysis that informed  the decision to retain quangos that were previously identified for abolition,  and, as part of its role to scrutinise the implementation of the review of  public administration, the Committee will continue to monitor progress towards  streamlining decision making and improving accountability.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is relatively short and has limited scope, and the  Committee has no objections to it passing Second Stage. However, the Bill  contains some contentious areas and does not address others, and I hope that  the Committee will be able to resolve those matters during the Committee Stage  of the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr G Kelly)</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat ar&iacute;s, a Cheann Comhairle. I am grateful for Members&rsquo;  contributions to the debate. Although the Bill is at an early stage, the  opinions expressed have been valuable and informative. I shall now attempt to  address the points that were raised in the debate; however, if I miss any, I  will write to the relevant Members.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my introductory comments about the benefits of  abolishing the Fisheries Conservancy Board, I referred to concerns about the  services that it provides and its financial position. The board&rsquo;s abolition  will create opportunities to reorganise the conservation and protection of  inland fisheries, which, as I also said, the Assembly previously supported.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">After transferring functions, policy responsibility and  former Fisheries Conservancy Board enforcement personnel will be under a single  management system, which will result in a more integrated and strategic conservation  and protection service. Such rationalisation will enable better utilisation of  Fisheries Conservancy Board and Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure  networks, intelligence and contacts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, transferring functions will provide an  opportunity to streamline regulatory and decision-making processes, and utilising,  when necessary, core departmental operational staff will offer greater  flexibility in the provision of on-the-ground resources. Given that the  Department already has regional out-stations and resources, work will also be  able to be better organised regionally.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Consideration has been given to stakeholder representation  after the transfer of Fisheries Conservancy Board functions to the Department.  Following the issue of the public consultation document in December 2007, about  establishing a stakeholder forum, a panel has been set up to analyse responses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the interim, when required, the Department will continue  to assist the Fisheries Conservancy Board both on the ground and in filling key  vacancies within the organisation. The Department will monitor the board  through monthly meetings and by representation on the board and its executive  committee.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Funding has been secured to ensure that the Fisheries  Conservancy Board remains operational until it is abolished. In all the  circumstances that I outlined, we are confident that the correct course of  action is being taken.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I mentioned earlier, the proposed changes to the  delivery of the functions of the Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board  will bring that area into line with the other two statutory advisory bodies  that exist in the field of social security: the Social Security Advisory  Committee and the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council. Those bodies advise  both the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and the Department for Social  Development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The changes will also go some way towards further reducing  the number of quangos &mdash; and several Members raised that point &mdash; while ensuring  that the Department for Social Development continues to have access to expert  independent advice on disability living allowance and attendance allowance.  There is no evidence that the Social Security Advisory Committee or the  Industrial Injuries Advisory Council have failed to consider the needs of  people here. We believe that there is no reason to suppose that a Disability  Living Allowance Advisory Board with a remit to cover our interests will fail  to address any particular local needs or circumstances.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Francie Molloy mentioned the loss of local input. As I  said, both the Social Security Advisory Committee and the Industrial Injuries  Advisory Council operate throughout Britain  and Ireland  already, and they do so very successfully. Les Allamby, director of the Law  Centre (NI), is the Northern    Ireland representative on the Social  Security Advisory Committee, and he plays a very active role in the committee&rsquo;s  work. We are considering how best the North can be represented when DLAAB takes  on its new role. The issue of individual cases was mentioned, but board members  do not consider individual cases in these circumstances.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mary Bradley asked about the cost-benefit analysis, which  is an issue that the OFMDFM Committee raised recently. The relevant information  on that is being gathered from lead Departments, but that process will take  time. However, we will endeavour to provide the Committee &mdash; and, indeed, Mrs  Bradley &mdash; with that information by the end of June. John Dallat mentioned  absentee landlords, but the Bill, which is a parity piece of legislation, does  not address that issue specifically.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure will continue  to promote angling through its public angling estate and will work for the  improvement and development of angling in general.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members mentioned quangos. Stephen Farry resisted  the temptation to say anything about quangos, so I will resist saying anything  about quangos and the Alliance Party. However, the OFMDFM Committee&rsquo;s interest  in the wider issue of reducing the number of quangos in general is welcome.  OFMDFM officials are working to provide the Committee with the information that  it has requested in order that it may consider the matter fully. However, I  suggest that the purpose of today&rsquo;s debate is to consider the general  principles of the Bill, rather than to speculate on what might have been  included in it. In any case, most of the bodies for which earlier decisions to  abolish or transfer functions were reversed by Ministers would not have been  included in the Public Authorities (Reform) Bill. The Bill&rsquo;s scope did not  extend to bodies where functions were to be transferred to local councils after  devolution. Only the decision to retain the Housing Council affected the  provisions of the original Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Naomi Long mentioned the Agricultural Wages Board, and on  behalf of the Committee, she also mentioned quangos. I am aware of the  Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development&rsquo;s view that provisions that  relate to the Agricultural Wages Board might be included in the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development  has not requested the inclusion of such provisions. Furthermore, it is not the  role of the Office of the First Minister and the deputy First Minister to  sponsor the Bill on behalf of the Executive or to introduce such provisions  unilaterally without the Minister&rsquo;s agreement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In response to Stephen Farry and Naomi Long; each Minister  has a responsibility to review, departmentally, the number of quangos. The  Department welcomes the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and the  deputy First Minister&rsquo;s interest in reducing the number of quangos. We will  consider that suggestion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I think that I have answered all questions; however, if I  have overlooked any, I assure Members that I will respond to them later. I  thank Members for their contributions to the debate on the Public Authorities  (Reform) Bill and for their questions. I am confident that the Bill will  provide greater effectiveness in the delivery of salmon and inland fisheries  and of disability living allowance and attendance allowance advisory functions.  The Executive are conducting the most wide-ranging reform of public services  for a generation. A commitment to world-class public services that meet the  needs of the economy and wider society is at the heart of that reform  programme. The Bill&rsquo;s main provisions are consistent with the Executive&rsquo;s  commitment to the delivery of more efficient and effective public services. I  commend the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Second Stage of the Public Authorities  (Reform) Bill (NIA 19/07) be agreed.</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="6"></a>Charities Bill</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Final Stage</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:2.85pt;"><strong>The Minister for Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Charities Bill (NIA 9/07) do now pass.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that this important Bill has reached its Final  Stage. I introduced it to the Assembly in December 2007, and although its  passage has been lengthy and time-consuming it has been productive. Today, I  want to reiterate the main purpose, aims and objectives of the Charities Bill  and thank the Committee for Social Development and other Members for their  careful and detailed scrutiny. Furthermore, I look forward to future  implementation developments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To date, much of the legislation&rsquo;s focus has been on the  establishment of a proper regulatory framework for charities in Northern Ireland.  That important step will keep us in line with developments in Great Britain and Ireland and help to ensure public  confidence in charitable giving. However, it is equally important that we will  be able to give proper recognition to the unique role and voluntary ethos of  the charitable sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to establish a strong, accessible and supportive  regulatory body in Northern    Ireland. Although its main function will be  to regulate and monitor charitable giving, it will also play a key role in the  development of effective relationships and partnerships with those who serve  the sector. The commission will be required to develop an ethos that promotes  confidence in charitable giving, encourages sharing of best practice and, ultimately,  helps to raise standards.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have been pleased with the universal welcome that the  Bill has received and for the cross-party support in the Committee for Social  Development and in the House. However, despite the widespread acceptance of the  principles of the legislation, there has been detailed and thorough scrutiny of  the 186 clauses and nine schedules. I thank the former Chairperson and members  of the Committee for Social Development for their extensive and considered  evidence taking, their useful suggestions for amendments and for their  comprehensive report, which was published on 13 May 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am confident that the process has produced better legislation  and that it will lead to appropriate regulation for charities in Northern Ireland.  I particularly welcome the engagement with faith-based charities and ethnic  minority groups; their input was invaluable, and I did not hesitate to propose  amendments to the Bill where that was the right thing to do.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the Bill&rsquo;s Consideration Stage on 3 June, I referred  to the progress of the Bill as evidence that local democracy was working. I  reiterate that message today. The passage of the Charities Bill and other  primary legislation shows that Assembly Members and others can influence the  decision-making process. It also shows that politicians listen and take action.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill, as it stands to be voted on by the Assembly,  shows how a Minister and a Committee, working together with the joint aim of  achieving better legislation, can achieve very positive outcomes. I will  continue to work with the Committee as we make proposals for the implementation  of the Charities Bill and the consequent regulations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now proceed with the public appointment process for  the new charity commissioners. I hope to be in a position to announce the names  of the successful candidates by the end of October, and I would like the commission  to be up and running by the end of the year. I have given a public commitment  to locate the body outside the greater Belfast  area. The decentralisation of public-sector jobs can make a significant  contribution to improving the regional economic balance across the North. I  hope to make a decision on the commission&rsquo;s location in the near future. It  will take some time to get the necessary subordinate legislation and other  mechanisms in place, but I trust that we can all look forward to better  regulation of local charities and improved public confidence in charitable  giving. I commend the Charities Bill to the House.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Simpson)</strong>: The Charities Bill  comprises 186 clauses and nine schedules. It has been welcomed by everybody,  including, most importantly, those in the voluntary and community sector. It  creates a modern legal framework to support and encourage a vibrant and diverse  third sector, and it provides robust controls around registration, regulation  and supervision.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill presents a perfect opportunity for the Assembly to  give legislative recognition to the important role that charities play in Northern Ireland.  Without the operation of charities, we would have a very different kind of  civil society. We are indebted to charities for providing vital services,  strengthening communities and representing the marginalised people in our  society. On behalf of the Social Development Committee, I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. As has been said, the Charities Bill is a  long and complex piece of legislation containing 186 clauses and nine  schedules. I thank the departmental officials who went through the Bill clause  by clause and facilitated the Committee in understanding its complexities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will provide a definition of &ldquo;charity&rdquo; and  &ldquo;charitable purpose&rdquo;, and it will establish a charity commission and a charity  tribunal. It will also create a register of charities and deal with the  regulation of charities and public charitable collections.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Initially, there was a lot of discussion around the issues  of designation of religious charities, in relation to the number of years that  they have been established and to the number of members. Evidence was received  from some smaller Churches, and the amendments made seem to have resolved the  situation and satisfied the majority of people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As has been said, evidence was also taken from members of  the voluntary sector. There was a lot of discussion around the make-up of the  commission. The voluntary sector felt that the commission should be a small  body with a chief and deputy chief commissioner, and possibly a staff of five.  That was considered adequate, and the consensus was that if the commission&rsquo;s  staff continued to grow unchecked in the future, its effectiveness would be  negated.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, it has been accepted that staffing levels must be  adequate in order to deal with the workload. The inclusion of one or two  legally qualified persons on the commission is acceptable in the short term  because of the need to interpret the complexities of the legislation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The charities here have recognised that anything that  boosts public confidence in them is important; the fact that charities will  have to submit accounts for scrutiny will reassure the public. Overall, the  Charities Bill can be considered a welcome piece of legislation. Go raibh m&iacute;le  maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Will the Minister tell the House how the charity commission will be staffed?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  wish to add my thanks to the departmental staff and the Committee staff. In  particular, I thank the Minister for Social Development for her open-mindedness  and her willingness to listen to representations from rural communities as well  as ethnic minority communities on the issue of designated religious status. The  staff were very patient with the Committee and helped us to plough through our  scrutiny of the 186 clauses of the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The voluntary sector and the charities certainly welcome  this long-awaited legislation, which has been applicable in other parts of the UK. The  charities see it as a positive Government intervention. We all now look forward  to the establishment of the charity commission, and we hope that the Department  will appoint a body of people with the appropriate knowledge and experience of  charities in Northern    Ireland, and that it will be given the  proper resources to meet its objectives and carry out its many functions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee believes that it is important at the outset  to have an awareness-raising campaign to help charitable bodies to obtain the  proper advice and information on becoming established in Northern Ireland.  Perhaps the Minister will also comment on the timescale for the establishment  of the charity commission.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I welcome this legislation, and congratulate the Minister on the volume of  legislation that she has laid before the House. Has the Minister any thoughts  on where the charity commission will be located?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: First, I wish to thank the Chairperson of the Social  Development Committee and other Committee members, namely, Mr Brady, Ms Lo, Mr  Dallat and Mrs Bradley, for their contributions to the debate. The progress of  the Bill has been greatly assisted by constructive input in the House and in  the Committee.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to working with all Members as we introduce  the necessary Orders and regulations to enact the legislation. I am also  committed to full consultation with the charity sector on important issues,  such as the public benefit test and the proposals for the regulation of charity  fund-raising. It is only by working together that we can ensure that a system  is put in place that meets the requirements of regulators, donors and charities  alike.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to take the opportunity to address the issues that  have been raised in the debate. Mr Brady and Mr Dallat asked about staffing,  and I wish to reassure them about that. The charity commission will have a  board comprising one chief charity commissioner, one deputy chief charity  commissioner and three to five charity commissioners.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have already approved the process for those public  appointments, which will be regulated by the Office of the Commissioner for  Public Appointments for Northern    Ireland. I intend the posts to be publicly  advertised in early July and to have commissioners in place by the end of  October. The charity commission will have up to 16 staff, including a chief  executive, based on comparison with the Office of the Scottish Charity  Regulator.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brady raised the issue of staff numbers. Although I have  said that there will be 16 staff, I will review staff numbers as and when  required. If more staff are required, I will consider further recruitment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have already referred to the location of the charity  commission, but I shall restate my position. My officials have been examining  accommodation options for the commission. They have visited premises throughout  Northern Ireland,  and I hope to make a decision on the location shortly. I will consider a range  of factors, including value for money and accessibility.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that I met Sir George Bain on 12 June,  and I put forward my views on the potential for decentralising public-sector  jobs, because that can make a significant contribution to improving the  regional economic balance across the North of Ireland. I understand that Sir  George will publish the outcome of his review later this year. However, I have  stated publicly that I intend to locate the commission&rsquo;s office and its jobs  outside the greater Belfast  area in order to afford greater accessibility to people, address the current  regional economic imbalance and provide the opportunity for other areas to  become hubs, as the regional development strategy promised.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The charity commission will be responsible for appointing  its own staff, and the legislation provides for staff to be directly recruited  or appointed through secondment. As I mentioned, there will be about 16 staff  members.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ms Lo asked about the timescale. I hope to decide quickly  on the charity commission&rsquo;s location and, when the Bill receives Royal Assent,  to advertise publicly for potential commissioners. I hope to fully implement  the appointment process, in accordance with the appropriate guidelines for  public appointments, by this autumn and to have the commission up and running  by the end of this year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I thank all Members who debated the Bill,  whether in Committee or in the House, for their substantial contributions and  for their considered advice on, and attitude towards, this new departure for  charities in Northern    Ireland. That attitude clearly demonstrates  that Government and local democracy are working, and it shows what can be  achieved when a Minister and Committee &mdash; in this case the Committee for Social  Development &mdash; work together for the common good of the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Charities Bill (NIA 9/07) do now pass.</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="7"></a>Draft Children and Young Persons &nbsp;(Sale  of Tobacco etc.) <br>
	        Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 2008</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Draft Children and Young Persons (Sale of Tobacco etc.) Regulations (Northern Ireland)  2008 be approved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I seek the Assembly&rsquo;s approval to introduce the aforementioned  statutory rule. Subject to the Assembly&rsquo;s approval, that rule will substitute  &ldquo;aged 18&rdquo; for &ldquo;aged 16&rdquo; in the Health and Personal Social Services (Northern  Ireland) Order 1978 and in the Children and Young Persons (Protection from  Tobacco) (Northern Ireland) Order 1991.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The rule&rsquo;s main purpose is to make it illegal to sell  tobacco products to anyone aged under 18, as opposed to under 16, which is the  present limit. It will also require the replacement of existing warning  statements in retail premises and on tobacco vending machines in order to  reflect the change in the law.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department will fund replacement signage. That measure  will bring Northern Ireland  into line with the rest of the United Kingdom  and the Republic   of Ireland on age of  sale, with effect from 1 September this year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Smoking is well recognised as the single greatest cause of  premature death and avoidable illness in Northern Ireland, claiming some  2,300 lives here each year. It is a major risk factor in coronary heart  disease, strokes, cancer and other diseases of the circulatory system, which  kill two in every five men and women here. Those diseases are also leading  causes of disability. A lifetime non-smoker is 60% less likely than a current  smoker to have coronary heart disease and 30% less likely to suffer a stroke.  Smoking is also a major cause of health inequalities and is the principal cause  of the gap in life expectancy between rich and poor. For example, instances of  lung cancer are 71% higher in deprived areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although much work remains to be done, we are having some  success in reducing adult smoking prevalence, which is currently 25% &mdash; the  lowest figure since the continuous household survey began in 1983.  Significantly, 79% of adult smokers in Northern Ireland took up the habit  in their teens, and 11% of children aged between 11 and 15 here are regular  smokers. If we are to achieve a significant reduction in smoking prevalence, we  must deter young people from taking up the habit. That is why I recently agreed  the inclusion of Northern    Ireland in a Department of Health-led  public-consultation exercise on the future of tobacco control. The consultation  seeks views on a range of issues that are likely to impact on children&rsquo;s  smoking, including advertising at point of sale and access to tobacco-vending  machines. I also intend to introduce proposals in due course that will impose  sanctions on retailers who persist in selling tobacco to underage customers.  That is important, because research in England found that 57% of children  obtain their cigarettes from shops.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have no doubt that controls already in place, such as  smoke-free enclosed public places and workplaces, will have a positive impact  on reducing smoking prevalence, especially among young people. My Department  provided resources to facilitate the appointment of additional enforcement  officers to maximise compliance with smoke-free legislation from April 2007.  That funding is continuing and is linked to enhanced enforcement activity on  underage sales. Our &lsquo;A Five Year Tobacco Action Plan 2003-2008&rsquo; identifies  children and young people as a key target group. That will remain an important  element of the plan as my officials begin the review process, with the aim of  rolling out the plan for a further five years. In developing the plan, my  officials will continue to consult the statutory- and voluntary-sector agencies  on how best to discourage young people from adopting the habit.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that I launched a 12-week  consultation exercise on 29 October 2007 to help me to assess the public&rsquo;s view  on the age of sale. I am pleased to say that the consultation elicited 90%  support for increasing the legal age of sale to 18. Members will also recall  that the Assembly debated that issue in November last year and strongly  supported increasing the age of sale to 18. In that debate, I gave a commitment  to bring to the Assembly any proposals to increase the age of sale. The motion  fulfils that commitment, and I believe that I have the Assembly&rsquo;s support for  increasing the age of sale of tobacco to 18.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  The Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety is grateful to  officials from the Department who briefed Members at a meeting on 17 April 2008  on the proposals. The Committee fully recognises that smoking is the greatest  preventable cause of death and illness, and welcomes any measures that will  help to discourage young people from starting to smoke in the first instance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chief Medical Officer&rsquo;s annual report, which was  published just last week, showed that almost 80% of adult smokers started  smoking in their teens and that an alarming 11% of children aged 11 to 15 are  already regular smokers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also supported the introduction of the  smoking ban in public places last year. The draft regulations that are before  the Assembly, which propose to increase the age at which cigarettes may be sold  legally from 16 to 18, were considered and agreed by the Committee at its  meeting on 19 June. As the Minister explained, the aim of the draft regulations  is to make it more difficult for young people to obtain cigarettes and to make  the sale and availability of cigarettes among young people less culturally  acceptable. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am vehemently anti-smoking &mdash; at any age. The Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety explained the detrimental effect that smoking has on  the lives of young and old people, and the rest of society. I realise that in  making such a strong statement, there might be some concern about the 25% of people  who do smoke. It is not my intention to criticise those people, but, as the  Minister and the Committee Chairperson said, one must consider the age at which  people start to smoke. Tobacco smoking is addictive, and many people start to  smoke cigarettes when they are young.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Research carried out by the Health Promotion Agency  revealed that 50% of children in forms 1 to 5 tried smoking cigarettes before  the age of 13. The evidence also confirms that the younger children are when  they first try smoking, the more likely they are to become regular tobacco  users and the less likely they are to quit.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister also stated that the number of deaths in Northern Ireland  that are directly attributable to smoking is somewhere between 2,300 and other  higher estimates. The most common age at which people start to smoke is 12 or  13; at that age, young people do not see themselves as real smokers but as  social smokers. That is the age at which they should be offered some  protection. Retailers also face the difficulty of trying to work out what age  young people actually are.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The emphasis that is placed on alcohol consumption and the  sale of alcohol to minors is astonishing, because tobacco is the one product  that is guaranteed to kill, even if it is used in moderation. That is why the  Assembly must be strong in trying to convey a message that zero tolerance will  be exhibited against those who sell cigarettes to young folk.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s initiatives on this issue, but  I hope that he will consider further measures. Perhaps, in his winding-up  speech, he will comment on the sale of 10-packs of cigarettes &mdash; the purchase of  which are prevalent among children &mdash; and retailers&rsquo; practice of selling  individual cigarettes to children on their way to school. There is a case for  secret shoppers or some other initiative to stamp out such practices, because  their impact on young people is so severe. I thank the Minister for introducing  the proposal, and I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I support the motion, as have other Members. The statistics provided to the  House by the Minister are horrendous, and they affect every member of society.  Smoking is, undoubtedly, a killer, and our Government have come a long way in  tackling the scourge. Cancer is a hellish disease, and, if we can prevent our  young children from smoking, we will have achieved much.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion goes some way to putting tobacco products out of  the reach of children, and I am sure that Members will support the Minister&rsquo;s  proposal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I take this opportunity to say that I support the next item  on the Order Paper, which is also smoking related.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. We will deal with one issue at a time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am grateful to the Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Iris Robinson,  and other Members who participated in the debate for their comments and  support. Basil McCrea mentioned the availability of 10-packs of cigarettes and  the sale of individual cigarettes, and he asked how the Department intended to  stamp out such practices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are doing that through a mixture of public information,  education and enforcement: I am dealing with enforcement in consultation with  colleagues in the rest of the UK,  and I am looking to the next phase of the tobacco action plan, which is under  review.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that raising the age of sale will not, by  itself, solve the problem of children smoking; rather it will compliment  improved enforcement activity and the ongoing prevention work that is being  undertaken by agencies, including health boards and trusts, the Health  Promotion Agency, the education sector and the Ulster Cancer Foundation. It  also represents an important milestone in the construction of what we all hope  will be a solid platform to help us to reach our long-term goal of a  tobacco-free society in Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Draft Children and Young Persons (Sale of Tobacco etc.) Regulations (Northern Ireland)  2008 be approved.</p>

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Draft Smoke-Free (Exemption, Vehicles, Penalties and  Discounted Amounts) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2008 be approved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am seeking the Assembly&rsquo;s approval to introduce the  aforementioned statutory rule, which arises as a consequence of the previous  motion. Subject to the Assembly&rsquo;s approval, the statutory rule will substitute  the words &ldquo;aged 18 years&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;aged 16 years&rdquo; in the Smoke-Free  (Exemptions, Vehicles, Penalties and Discounted Amounts) Regulations (Northern  Ireland) 2007. That means that under the smoke-free legislation, the existing provision  whereby smoking may be permitted in a designated room in specified residential  accommodation used by persons aged 16 years or over, will be amended to read  &ldquo;aged 18 years or over&rdquo;. I commend the motion to Members.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  On 19 June, the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety  considered the draft regulations and strongly supported the provisions. I  support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I want to bring to the attention of the Minister and Members the positive  outcomes that have been achieved since the banning of smoking in public places  of work. On Friday 30 May, I attended a meeting at which the Chartered  Institute of Environmental Health reported that following the introduction of  the smoking ban, there were significant improvements in air quality. Research  by the Ulster Cancer Foundation found that the exposure of bar workers to  second-hand smoke fell by 94%. In the home, and socially, exposure to  second-hand smoke fell by two thirds.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Most importantly, the effects were felt by the people  themselves &mdash; bar workers reported an astounding improvement in their health,  with 33% reporting less eye irritation, runny noses, sore throats, coughs and  other significant improvements in their health. I, therefore, commend the  Minister for his action.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I thank Mrs Robinson and Mr  McCrea for their positive responses. As Mr McCrea said, there are already  positive outcomes flowing from the legislation that we have put through, and I  believe that that can be reinforced by the measures that we have agreed today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  It is obvious that business in the House has moved on faster than some Members  realise. I ask that Members take their ease for a few minutes.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="10"></a>Rising Energy Costs</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to two hours for this debate. The  proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10 minutes for the  winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (Mr Durkan)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes with concern that rising energy  costs are hitting families in Northern Ireland harder than in the rest of the  UK; and calls on the Executive to:</p>
	      <p class="Q1Quote" style="margin-left:13.0pt;text-indent:-13.0pt;">(i) give further priority to measures to promote  energy efficiency and combat fuel poverty;</p>
	      <p class="Q1Quote" style="margin-left:13.0pt;text-indent:-13.0pt;">(ii) drive a coordinated energy policy to diversify  our energy supplies, reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, increase competition  in our energy market and harness the full potential of renewable energy;</p>
	      <p class="Q1Quote" style="margin-left:13.0pt;text-indent:-13.0pt;">(iii) cooperate with other Governments,  including through the British Irish Council, to develop a longer-term strategy  for these islands, and;</p>
	      <p class="Q1Quote" style="margin-left:13.0pt;text-indent:-13.0pt;">(iv) urge the UK  Government to re-direct the windfall VAT revenue from higher energy bills to be  used to mitigate the escalation of fuel poverty in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to debate rising energy costs. It  is the first motion that the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment has tabled  for debate. The Committee has received a substantial amount of evidence from a  number of key stakeholders. It is unanimous in its concern that urgent steps  must be taken by the Executive to address what is fast becoming a critical  situation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">From evidence supplied to the Committee, it is obvious that  the increase in energy prices is a complex issue that touches every family and  business in Northern Ireland.  Today&rsquo;s debate is timely, given the escalation of energy costs and the news  that senior energy industry insiders predict further increases of up to 40%  this year. That, according to figures outlined in Westminster  last week, could plunge an additional 1&middot;6 million people across the UK into fuel  poverty, and the Bank of England has warned consumers to brace themselves for:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the most difficult economic challenge for two  decades.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As recently as last Thursday, the Organization of the  Petrolium Exporting Countries (OPEC) warned that oil prices could soar to as  high as $170 a barrel in the summer, bringing further misery to consumers and  additional stress to businesses. In evidence to the Committee, the utility  regulator warned that the spike in energy prices is not a temporary blip; the  supply-and-demand and political factors that lie behind the crisis will  continue in the long run.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland faces sharp increases in the wholesale  prices of gas, oil, electricity and carbon. Coal prices are also at record  levels, partly influenced by the cold winter in China. Normally, China is a substantial  exporter of coal, but it did not export enough last winter. In the medium to  long term, other global factors must be considered, such as the emergence of  massive new markets in China  and India  and the globalisation of gas prices. Liquefied natural gas will become the  marginal unit, as it can be transported in a way that pipeline gas cannot. Politically,  the EU is tightening its emission limits, and that, coupled with political  uncertainty in the Middle East and Russia, is causing energy prices to  reach boiling point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The utility regulator assured the Committee that only  genuine costs are passed on to consumers and that he will continue to bear down  on monopoly costs. However, he warned that if Northern Ireland is to address the  energy crisis and successfully combat fuel poverty, it must change its ways.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not wish to pre-empt Members from focusing on the  effects of rising energy prices, it is equally important to talk about  promoting energy efficiency as a means of combating fuel poverty, which is a  bigger problem in Northern Ireland  than in other regions of the UK,  partly because of relatively low incomes and the higher cost of fuel. In 2006,  some 34% of people here were deemed to be living in fuel poverty, and the  Consumer Council has warned that the increase in fuel prices will cause that  figure to rise sharply to over 40%.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee acknowledges the work of the fuel poverty  task force and its progress in identifying the fuel poor. Alarmingly, however,  a recent Audit Office report on the warm homes scheme confirmed that 30% of the  grants went to homes that were already energy efficient and to those who were  at little risk of fuel poverty. The report went on to state that significant  numbers of the fuel poor were being excluded from assistance, including the low  paid and those who are eligible for, but do not claim, benefits. The Committee requests  that the task force urgently examine the report&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another energy efficiency issue is that the Reconnect scheme  that provided grants of up to 50% to householders to install renewable energy  systems has ended, and the Committee urges the Executive to undertake an  evaluation of that situation as a matter of urgency.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee unanimously supports a co-ordinated energy  policy. The challenge faces not only Northern Ireland but all people and  Administrations throughout these islands, and a co-ordinated energy policy is  required to diversify energy supplies, increase competition in the energy  market and harness the full potential of renewable energy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on fossil fuels is of  concern: 70% of consumers burn oil as their main source of heat. Northern Ireland uses more carbon-rich fuels  than anywhere else in the UK  and its consumers are, therefore, more exposed to carbon costs than elsewhere  in the UK or Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Importing fossil fuels presents its own risk. There is  increased competition for energy resources in the face of growing global energy  demand. Increasingly, reserves are concentrated in fewer, further away places  and in markets that are neither transparent nor truly competitive. To ensure  security of supply, a co-ordinated energy strategy is needed to maximise the  economic production of our domestic energy sources, which, together with  co-ordinated energy-saving measures, will greatly reduce our dependence on  energy imports.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Only last week in Westminster,  I attended an event that examined fuel poverty throughout the UK. There, a  key player in the energy sector, speaking on UK policies, said that the strategy  of having no strategy was not working and that the whole emphasis of public  policy over the years, which amounted to reliance on market solutions, was not  enough. Other, more active interventions and co-ordinating measures are needed.  That is why the motion raises issues not just at a regional level but at a  British-Irish level.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Increased competition in our energy market is vital. The  Committee welcomes the utility regulator&rsquo;s efforts to address monopoly costs  and his assurance that substantial costs have been removed from the gas  network. However, we urge that measures be taken to encourage greater competition.  Such measures are a necessary vehicle for maintaining efficiency incentives and  ensuring that consumers benefit from any improvements further up the value  chain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">More efficient use of the all-island gas infrastructure is  urgently required. The acceleration of gas roll-out will help to drive out use  of the most carbon-intensive fuels and reduce dependency on oil. Of all the  fossil fuels, natural gas is the cleanest and most environmentally friendly.  Compared with oil, it emits over 30% less carbon dioxide, and compared with  coal, it emits over 50% less. Given those benefits, the Committee was concerned  to hear from Firmus Energy of continued delays in connecting to the gas network  in the public-sector estate and delays in releasing funds to complete the Northern  Ireland Housing Executive&rsquo;s heating-replacement programme. We urge the  Executive to consider that issue, given the significant contribution that gas  can make to reducing Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s CO2 emissions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the longer term, most important may be the need to  harness the full potential of renewable energy. However, great challenges lie  ahead. In the west, the grid is weak and is not currently capable of receiving  the large expansion of wind generation that is likely to be required. Our  planning system is also a worry &mdash; it will make it difficult to respond rapidly  to change. There is only one interconnector with Great Britain, and only one other  is planned. Even with two interconnectors, it is questionable that that will be  sufficient to facilitate the use of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s large  wind-energy resource.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To achieve all that, and in order to develop a longer-term  energy strategy for these islands, it is crucial that greater co-operation with  other Governments takes place. That should include co-operation through the  British-Irish Council and North/South structures.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee urges the Executive to challenge the UK  Government to use the estimated &pound;10&middot;5 million of extra VAT revenue that is  forthcoming as a result of rising fuel prices to help vulnerable households  this winter. The Committee identified those moneys because it did not want the  motion to demand that the Executive make more money available from their  hard-pressed Budget, but to point the Executive in the direction of other  revenues for which they could lobby. The word from the Treasury is that it is  not interested in making that money available. However, the Treasury also  recently insisted that it would not address or revise tax issues but, as a  result of political pressure, it had to do so. Therefore, we urge the Executive  to bring those issues directly to the Treasury.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  As the Chairman said in his opening remarks, this is a big issue. Individual  Members take it seriously and the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment took it  extremely seriously, as is evidenced by the mammoth amount of evidence that it  took over the past few weeks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members have only to go to their constituencies and talk to  folk to realise how important rising energy costs are to people&rsquo;s everyday  lives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The gravity of the problem is demonstrated by the fact  that, in the height of summer &mdash; such as it is in Northern Ireland &mdash; we are  discussing rising fuel costs. Had the debate occurred in a particularly bad,  cold winter, we may have been able to see past the massive percentage increases  that we have been experiencing. For example, the price of gas has increased by  28%, coal by 25%, electricity by 14%, and that, indeed, may increase further  before the end of the year. The price of oil is at a record high. Those  increases are bad at any time, but this time of year only accentuates the  severity of the problem.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion deals quite properly with the problem and  suggests how it could be dealt with in the short and longer term. Similar to  any such difficulty that creeps up and hits us like this, there are short-term  problems that require short-term solutions. However, we should not be foolish  enough not to consider the long-term measures that will be needed to overhaul  our whole approach and attitude towards our energy supply.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Fuel poverty will be raised time and again during the  debate. I represent Strangford, which most perceive to be a fairly well-off  constituency. However, even in a constituency such as that there are, according  to the most recent estimates, some 7,000 households living in fuel poverty.  That is approximately one quarter of the total households in Strangford.  Indeed, that figure can only rise, given what is happening more widely with the  price of fuel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the existence of an Executive subcommittee on  fuel poverty. The Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment mentioned  the Audit Office&rsquo;s criticisms of the warm homes scheme. Those criticisms aside,  I am thankful that that scheme exists and that it has been able to alleviate  some people&rsquo;s problems and take others out of fuel poverty. There is more good  than bad in the scheme, and now that difficulties and issues have been  identified, they can &mdash; and should &mdash; be overcome.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the motion does not specifically mention the  winter fuel allowance, it has not risen in line with the rise in fuel costs. A  windfall levy on VAT should be considered. The Government may argue that  falling prices in the construction industry have resulted in their losing  revenue in areas such as stamp duty. However, it is evident that there is  potential to use the massive amount of VAT that is made on fuel of all kinds in  order to help alleviate fuel poverty.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Longer-term solutions are also required, and we in Northern Ireland  must play our part by taking a longer-term approach to rising fuel costs. As  the Committee Chairperson said, the utility regulator, in a sobering evidence  session before the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, indicated that price rises will not slide away and return  to normal, whatever that means. We will see such price rises time and again  unless action is taken.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Opening the Northern    Ireland market to competition would be a  powerful tool, but in many respects, our energy market is too immature for  that. However, the real potential lies with renewable forms of energy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is almost the set answer when discussing matters such as  this to suggest that renewables are the future and the answer. However, that  point is particularly important in Northern   Ireland, not because renewables have the potential to  ease some of our difficulties, but because of the potentially massive economic  advantages that Northern    Ireland has in renewables. Indeed, we could  be the Saudi Arabia  &mdash; so to speak &mdash; of wind power, and wave energy also has huge potential. I  support the investment that is required to bring our electricity grid up to the  standard that would allow it to deal with some of those renewables. We are  still at a low level, but it will take massive investment to do that. That  investment is certainly required.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for intergovernmental co-operation, which  I support. We are a very small part of the world, and if we cannot solve the  problem on our own, we will need to work with neighbouring Governments, our own  Government in Westminster,  and the European Union.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I speak today in my capacity both  as the Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel and as an  individual MLA.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Committee report and the debate, which is  timely in the context of the spiralling energy costs that have exposed our  heavy reliance on fossil fuels and highlighted the pressing issue of fuel  poverty. The debate also intensifies the focus on climate change and  sustainable development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issues that are encapsulated in the motion are  cross-cutting at governmental and departmental levels. A not-so obvious but  important example relates to building regulations, which were studied in detail  by the Committee for Finance and Personnel, of which I am Chairperson. As part  of its consideration of the Building Regulations (Amendment) Bill, the  Committee published a report, which Members received during the past week. That  report contains recommendations that apply to the themes of this debate, such  as promoting energy efficiency and harnessing the potential of renewable  energy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">While scrutinising the Bill, the Committee took evidence  from stakeholders, including the Energy Savings Trust, Northern Ireland  Environmental Link and the Sustainable Energy Association. Their evidence  highlighted the immediate and longer-term challenges to the Executive that are  posed by our reliance on fossil fuels. As well as climate change and  sustainable development, those challenges include fuel poverty and  cost-of-living increases, which all MLAs are addressing at constituency level.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In its evidence, Northern Ireland Environmental Link  pointed out that energy use in buildings represented 81% of  non-transport-related energy consumption, with oil the primary heating fuel. It  emphasised the importance of diversifying sources of energy and of reducing  energy consumption, particularly in the face of increased oil prices and issues  of security of supply. It is worth noting that only 4% of our electricity comes  from renewable sources. Less than 1% comes from indigenous renewables, to which  Mr Hamilton referred.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Finance and Personnel concluded that  building regulations can play an important part in achieving increased  renewable-energy targets. The Committee wants building regulations to be used  to encourage the take-up of renewable energy technologies. Incentives must be  provided. It is imperative that the relevant industries respond to that demand.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has made proposals on how to stimulate demand  for renewable-energy technologies. Those proposals include developing the  capacity of the local renewables industry to support commercialisation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The evidence also highlighted the critical role of planning  policy in promoting renewable energy through, for example, granting development  rights for small-scale renewable systems and for micro- and macro-generation  schemes, such as community heat networks and larger-scale wind generation for  new housing developments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Economics and environmental concerns are forcing serious  consideration of such issues. The Committee also considered evidence about how  progress is being made on that matter, south of the border. Committee members  welcomed the fact that local planning services were seriously considering those  issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Bearing in mind how important it is to stimulate demand for  renewables and to support the early-adopter market, the Committee called on the  Finance Minister to work with his Executive colleagues to ensure that priority  be given to funding in order to encourage the uptake and development of  renewable-energy technologies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In highlighting the relevance of the work of the Committee  for Finance and Personnel to the matters under debate, I support the call for  windfall VAT revenues from higher energy bills to be returned to the Assembly  and Executive in order to mitigate fuel poverty. The Committee recently raised  a range of measures that the Executive might consider in an effort to help to  ease increases in the costs of living and the hardship imposed on many  households by rising energy and fuel prices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and I look forward to hearing other  contributions to the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: It  is not an exaggeration to say that Northern   Ireland &mdash; indeed, the entire United Kingdom &mdash; is heading towards  an energy crisis that will mean extreme hardship for the most vulnerable people  and families this winter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, increasing energy prices, coupled with increases  in the cost of food and consumer goods, is having a serious impact on all  hard-working families, many of whom will be facing fuel poverty.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been estimated that average bills will have  increased by 61% by the end of this year. That is an unprecedented increase  that will have a crippling effect on many households, who will face stark and  tough choices. Businesses, and even Government services, are also struggling  with the increased costs. The problem is greater in Northern   Ireland as we have lower wages and higher energy costs  than the rest of the United    Kingdom.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is vital that we take steps to reduce the outlay of the  thousands of families and businesses that are struggling with energy costs.  Historically, Northern    Ireland has had a non-competitive energy  market, so I applaud the steps taken towards creating a single electricity  market by the previous Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and that  Department. Equally, steps that have been taken to open up the natural-gas  market should be applauded.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although much of the groundwork for producing a competitive  electricity market in Northern    Ireland has been done, we must ensure that  that work results in genuinely open competition that will give consumers more  choice and make prices more economical. Currently, such competition does not  exist. It is, therefore, vital that we continue to work with our British and  Irish counterparts to ensure the long-term success of our fledgling energy  market and our future energy policies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The more energy efficient that people&rsquo;s homes and  businesses become, the less energy they will have to use, which will therefore  reduce their energy bills. It is thought that, in the UK, a typical  house is using five times the energy that it should. The warm homes scheme  should be commended; however, the delivery of that scheme could be improved. We  must guarantee that those who are most in need benefit from the scheme,  especially in the run-up to winter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is crucial that all households and businesses do what  they can to conserve energy. We must instil an ethos of improving energy  efficiency throughout society. As an Assembly and an Executive, we must set an  example and provide all the necessary information and help to those families  and businesses seeking to improve their energy efficiency. Building regulations  and the planning review have crucial strategic roles, as do sustainable  development strategies, which must ensure that we have the most  energy-efficient and environmentally friendly development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland, we are overwhelmingly reliant on  fossil fuels for our energy needs. As the price of a barrel of oil has now  reached $140, we are all feeling the pain of such reliance. In the long term,  it is crucial that we become less dependent on fuel imports. We must increase  the security of our energy supply. By diversifying into renewable energy  sources, we can simultaneously meet our EU climate change and renewable energy  obligations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As we all know, climate change is one of the most pressing  problems facing the world today and, regardless of anyone&rsquo;s opinion on it,  renewable energy is the direction in which Europe  is looking for a large proportion of its energy supply. Northern Ireland  now has an immense opportunity for the development of that sector; however, to  date, we have been sleepwalking behind the Labour Government on the issue. The  launch of a consultation on the UK  renewable energy strategy is a great opportunity to place Northern Ireland at the forefront of renewable  technology and development in the UK  and Europe. The Executive must ensure that we  are represented in any future renewable strategy and policy. In 10 years&rsquo; time,  for example, we do not want a situation in which the British renewable markets  have developed while we in Northern    Ireland are as reliant as ever on  fossil-fuel energy production.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot simply assume, however, that all our energy needs  can be met by renewable technology and production, because they will not. In  order to reach the EU target of 15% energy production from renewable sources,  we must increase our renewable production tenfold. That is a highly ambitious  target.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The final point in the motion causes some difficulties for  the Ulster Unionist Party. We are currently facing a severe downturn in the  economy, which is affecting Government revenue intake in many areas. It is  estimated that Westminster  is facing a &pound;5 billion annual shortfall on stamp duty alone. Fiscal  responsibility must be shown, and calling for narrow redistribution on a fuel  windfall is, perhaps, not the best way forward.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member bring his remarks to a close?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  will, certainly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, if such a move were to be made, any redirection of  funds must be made to pensioners. With that reservation, I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  support the motion. The recent establishment of the all-party group on energy,  which meets tomorrow, shows the importance of the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have a vested interest in the issue of energy, because  the Kilroot and Ballylumford power stations and the electricity and natural-gas  interconnectors are in my East Antrim  constituency. No issue has caught the imagination of the public as much as the  rising cost of energy &mdash; I hear concerns about the rising cost of energy, petrol  and diesel on a daily basis. Therefore, this is a big issue &mdash; it is not a local  issue, it is a global one and must be tackled as such. A report in &lsquo;The  Independent&rsquo; today states that every household in the country will face a &pound;213  rise in its annual energy bill if the UK is to meet EU emissions targets.  That is just one example of the problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, the Kilroot power station has been installing a  flue gas desulphurisation plant, which costs millions of pounds. However, it is  not widely know that that is funded by the Government rather than the profits  of AES, which is the company that owns the power station. That arrangement was  agreed when the electricity industry was privatised.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment has heard a considerable amount of evidence from a wide  range of sources. Energy has dominated much of the Committee&rsquo;s time since the  return of devolution, and rightly so. In the last mandate, I suggested a six-  to eight-week inquiry into energy, which in fact lasted 10 months. That shows  the complexities involved in the issue. Much of the evidence that the Committee  received focused on the need for a co-ordinated energy policy that promotes  energy efficiency, diversifies our energy supplies and harnesses the full  potential of renewable energy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Consumer Council has provided helpful infor&shy;mation to  the Committee on a range of issues: for example, half of the fuel poor in Northern Ireland  are under 60, and 23% of those people have children. Fuel poverty in Northern Ireland is double the average in GB and  triple the average in England.  Those statistics show the enormity of the problem. However, there are ways to deal  with that. For example, I commend the warm homes schemes to Members, because  they have been active throughout Northern Ireland and made a major  contri&shy;bution towards better energy efficiency in our homes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Energywatch states that rising prices between 2003 and 2006  resulted in a 94% increase in average domestic gas bills and a 60% increase in  electricity bills. The Energy Saving Trust, which makes a major contribution to  the attempts to educate the population of Northern Ireland about energy  efficiency, states that the most effective way to ensure affordable warmth in a  household is to reduce the amount that is spent on heating, hot water and  supplying electrical appliances. Obviously, there is a big education process in  progress.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members have already referred to the development of the  single electricity market, which I welcome. However, the generators have  encountered problems, which will &mdash; hopefully &mdash; be addressed when we return from  recess.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no shortage of coal throughout the world. Speaking  as someone with experience of working in the solid-fuel market, I believe that  coal distributors have taken advantage of the current situation.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  support the motion and I thank the Chairman of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment for tabling it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The background to the debate is that Phoenix Natural Gas  announced a price increase of 28% in April 2008 and NIE announced a price  increase of 14% in May 2008. It is anticipated that an additional increase will  be confirmed shortly and will be implemented in the autumn, which will take the  NIE price increase to around 33% within approximately six months. There may be  further increases.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over many years, the cost of energy in Northern Ireland has been high and has remained  above that paid by our neighbours in the rest of the UK. That has been the case for both  the business community and householders, and, in many ways, the high cost of  energy to manufacturers and the business community in general has driven up  normal living costs for individuals and families. It costs more, in energy  terms, to produce a loaf of bread in Northern   Ireland than in any other part of the UK.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that we are now in a global situation in  which oil and gas are being traded on the high seas, and prices have  significantly increased for end-users over the past 12 months.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Oil has not yet peaked in price, and, when combined with  increasing demand from developing countries, there seems to be no prospect of a  reduction in cost. Local oil users have experienced cost increases of  approximately 75% during the past 12 months.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Gas is tracking the oil price, and, with self-sufficiency  of supply in doubt, there will be a growing dependency on imported gas in the  coming years, with all the potential implications that that may mean.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Neeson was right to say that there is no shortage of  coal in respect of world supply. However, high shipping costs have resulted in  increased prices and there is a high demand from other countries, leading to  uncompetitive prices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls on the Executive to drive a co-ordinated  energy policy to diversify energy supplies. I agree that something must be  urgently done. Difficulties are being experienced by the people of Northern Ireland  now, and they are looking for some action to alleviate their current levels of  hardship. Fuel poverty is a greater problem in this part of the UK than in any  other region. Approximately 144,000 homes have been identified as experiencing  fuel poverty, which is much higher as a percentage than in England, Scotland,  Wales and the Irish Republic.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The answer lies &mdash; I take a different view to that of Mr  Cree &mdash; in the windfall VAT revenue that is derived from increased revenue due  to higher energy prices, which could be used to mitigate increasing fuel  poverty.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Statistics confirm the seriousness of the situation, with  24% of Northern Ireland  households &mdash; including 40% of senior citizens &mdash; in 2004 being identified as  being in fuel poverty. In 2006, 34% of Northern Ireland householders had  been identified as being in the same situation. The increased cost of energy  equates to an increase in domestic energy bills of approximately 94% from 2003  to 2006.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Government are doing nicely out of the increased  taxation that has been raked in as a result of escalating prices, and they hold  the answer by reducing taxation or redistributing the excessive amounts that  they have already clawed in. I ask for that point to be taken on board and  followed up by the Executive, because that is the only prospect that I can  think of to attempt to address the issues within a reasonable timescale.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a growing need for proper consideration of nuclear  energy. French consumers benefit from the right mix of energy generation, and  nuclear energy is part of that. The Prime Minister indicated that he will  upgrade and replace GB nuclear power plants. It is probable that we are already  getting electricity from a nuclear source. The nuclear debate is controversial,  but it is inevitable that that debate that will have to occur.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Questions to the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety will commence at 2.30 pm, so I propose that Members take their ease  until that time. This debate will resume at 4.00 pm, when the first Member to  be called to speak will be Mrs Claire McGill.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenAnswersHeading"><a name="11"></a>Oral Answers to Questions</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading">Health, Social Services And Public Safety</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Containing Infection: Staffing Levels</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Loan </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety what  plans he has to address problems with staffing levels of microbiologists,  antibiotic pharmacists and infection control nurses as highlighted by the  Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority review.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO4219/08>(AQO 4219/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: In recognition of  the growing need for medical microbiologists and infection-control nurses, my  Department has already invested in increasing the number of specialists in  those fields. The package of measures to tackle healthcare-associated  infections that I announced in January 2008 included recurrent funding for five  antibiotic pharmacists &mdash; one for each trust.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department is considering the recommendations in the  interim report of the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (RQIA) and  preparing an action plan. That work will include consideration of the workforce  issues and any resource implications. The review team aims to produce its final  report by the end of July 2008. Before finalising the action plan, the  Department will wish to consider any further recommendations that the RQIA  makes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Will the Minister tell us what the contribution of the three specialisms is to  the solution of the current clostridium difficile outbreak in the Northern  Health and Social Care Trust area? Will he provide a progress report on the  outbreak?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As I reported to the House  recently, the incidence of clostridium difficile in the Northern Trust area and  in Antrim Area Hospital  has reduced greatly. It is anticipated that we will shortly be able to declare  that the outbreak is over.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The three disciplines concerned are antibiotic pharmacists,  infection-control nurses and medical microbiologists. If an elderly, frail  person presents with a severe chest infection that is liable to cause a fatality,  the standard treatment is antibiotics. Unfortunately, clostridium difficile is  a side effect in some cases, which can be just as deadly as the original  infection. Therefore, antibiotics must be targeted. Pharmacists are needed in  each trust area to provide advice to the doctors who treat the patients.  Infection-control nurses must ensure that infections are contained and that  best practice is followed in wards.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. He anticipated one of my questions. I  welcome the announcement that he expects the final report by the end of July  2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister indicate how many of the 30-plus interim  report recommendations are being implemented?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I presume that the Member refers  to the work that was carried out as part of the RQIA review. As he said, I  anticipate that that will be finalised by the end of July 2008. We are drawing  up an action plan to ensure that good practice is achieved in all the trusts.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  My colleague Basil McCrea and I are not wearing pink ties to wind up Mrs Iris  Robinson. We are wearing them for a much more serious reason &mdash; to highlight the  breast cancer campaign. It was great that the Minister visited the group this  morning.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate the Minister on his policy of unannounced  hospital inspections. It has led to the recent RQIA report into cleanliness at Craigavon Area Hospital.  Following the publication of the report, will the Minister indicate what  measures have been put in place to swiftly address the shortcomings that were  identified? Will he continue to give high priority to hospital cleanliness so  that confidence is maintained in the Health Service?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As far as Craigavon Area   Hospital is concerned, an  action plan was immediately put in place by the trust. That is being followed  through as we speak. The RQIA also inspected a number of other hospitals, and  reports will issue in due course.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as continuing work is concerned, I refer to the  previous measures that I announced, which included the changing the culture  action plan, the ward sisters&rsquo; charter and, primarily, the &pound;9 million package  of measures that I announced in January. Those included restrictions on hospital  visiting; dress code; the hand hygiene campaign that I launched last week;  rapid-response units; cleaning teams; and unannounced hospital inspections.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Loch Cuan House,  Newtownards</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Shannon </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to  provide a timescale for the newbuild of Loch Cuan House in Newtownards and  explain what is being done to accommodate the remaining 12 residents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO4213/08>(AQO 4213/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: It is not possible to provide a  timetable for the development of the newbuild at the Loch Cuan site at this  stage. The South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust has indicated that an  equality impact assessment and full public consultation are necessary before  any final decision on the future of Loch Cuan House can be taken. The trust  will then have to develop a business case outlining its proposals for the site  and submit it to my Department for scrutiny and approval. Once the business  case has been approved, it will become clear what the expected timescale for  the newbuild at Loch Cuan will be. Consequently, there are no formal plans or  an associated timescale to move residents out of Loch Cuan House at present.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members to ensure that their mobile phones are switched  off, as there is interference with the transmission.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I am concerned that there is no timescale for the newbuild. However, I am sure  that that is not the Minister&rsquo;s intention, as he will want to reply quickly.  Nevertheless, 12 elderly, frail and disabled residents remain in Loch Cuan  House, and they and their families are concerned and need to know what is  happening. I am aware of the health and well-being of some of the residents.  Will the Minister confirm the date for the business plan and the commencement  of building?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have another supplementary question, Mr Deputy Speaker.  Will part of the building be knocked down and the newbuild erected on site?  Will the 12 residents move into the newbuild, and work then continue on  knocking down the old building? I apologise for being long-winded.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Minister can select any one of those questions. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I refer Mr Shannon to the answer  that I have given. The trust has said that an equality impact assessment and  full public consultation are necessary and, as he is aware, that has not  happened or begun. After that, a business case will have to be developed, and  clearly that has not happened either. The matter is in the hands of the trust.  However, I assure the Member that immediately formal plans or associated  timescales are decided, I will let him, the residents of Loch Cuan House and  their families know.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 3 has been withdrawn; Mr McGlone is not in his place for  question 4; question 5 has been withdrawn; and Mr Dominic Bradley is not in his  place for question 6.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">LGBT Groups: Mental-Health Needs</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Dr Farry </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for his assessment  of the mental-health needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO4240/08>(AQO 4240/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Everyone is valued equally and  is entitled to have his or her mental-health needs assessed and treated in the  most appropriate way. I am aware that anyone who has a lesbian, gay, bisexual  or transgender sexual orientation often has specific and heightened  mental-health needs arising from rejection or hostility from his or her family,  the workplace and the wider community. That stigmatisation and discrimination  can make them reluctant to engage with mainstream mental-health services. I  expect any treatment or support by health and social care staff to be offered  in a way that is sensitive to the issues arising from a patient&rsquo;s sexual  orientation, and to be delivered in a way that leads to the best outcome.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his positive answer. Will he confirm that sexuality is  biological and that it is not accepted practice in either psychiatry or  psychotherapy to try to cure homosexuality? Furthermore, will he confirm that  there is no direct correlation between sexuality and the prevalence of mental  disorders, but that it is environmental stresses, such as the intolerance of  society, that create problems?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I confirm the first part of Mr  Farry&rsquo;s remarks. In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association concluded that  there was no scientific evidence that homosexuality was a disorder and removed  it from its diagnostic glossary of mental disorders.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The World Health Organization followed suit, as did the  British Government. As far as treatments are concerned, the issue is that  although sexual orientations are not mental illnesses, members of lesbian, gay,  bisexual and transgender groups do have specific mental-health needs. They  experience discrimination, homophobic bullying, harassment, family rejection,  and so on, often leading to suicidal behaviour and self-harm.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The evidence suggests that there are higher than average  levels of suicide and substance abuse among those groups. Therefore, their  mental-health needs are commensurate, and they are entitled to be treated  equally, and in a way that best deals with the problems that they encounter,  and their reaction to those problems. In fact, one of the key principles of  treatment is that taking a non-judgmental attitude lies at the heart of much of  the therapeutic activity. Indeed, the Bamford Review made strong  recommendations along those lines.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Over the past few weeks, some people have attempted to suggest that I indicated  that homosexuality is a mental-health issue, and they have twisted everything  that was said on Stephen Nolan&rsquo;s radio show. I have got broad shoulders, and can  take the brickbats that followed from that. However, nothing could be further  from the truth. What I did say was that homosexuality &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Ask a question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I am getting to it. Homosexuality, like all sin, is an abomination. That is  what I said. My point, however, is that there are some people &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Ask a question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member ask the question?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I am getting to the question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  You are reading a statement.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  No, I am not.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Yes, you are.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Who is the Speaker here?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member come to the question?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I certainly will. Does the Minister agree that there are some people who, in  their teenage years, are sexually confused, and that they could do with help  from practitioners to assist them with talking therapies, to help them to  realise exactly what they are &mdash; whether they are heterosexual or homosexual?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am not in a position to talk  about sexual confusion. What I am in a position to do is to reflect what the  American Psychiatric Association concluded. There are cognitive-behaviour  therapies available, and one of the thrusts of the Bamford Review concerned the  need for provision to deal with depression, panic disorder, social phobia,  bulimia, obsessive and compulsive disorders, and so on. That is very much the  thrust of the work that my Department is undertaking, and of the budget allocation  that I am making for the provision of mental-health services.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. To a degree, the Minister has  already answered my question. Does he agree that there is a high incidence of  mental-health problems, including suicide and self-harm, among young gay people  particularly, who are only becoming aware of their sexuality, and does he agree  that there is a need for people to be very sensitive and tolerant in their use  of language &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: A key issue is that those  providing therapies in the health and mental-health services take a  non-judgmental attitude. That lies at the very heart of therapeutic activity  and interventions designed to support people. The Member is right, and I have  made the point that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender groups experience  high levels of discrimination, harassment and social isolation, and that leads  on to &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: That leads to a  higher-than-average incidence of suicidal behaviour and self-harm, which must  be dealt with. I intend to continue to deal with that issue, not least, for example,  because the UK-wide mental-health group Mind is concerned that such prejudice  and discrimination may even extend among health and social care staff. I take  that issue extremely seriously.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Glenside Adult  Training Centre, Strabane</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mr  Bresland </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  what funding has been provided to Glenside Adult Training Centre in Strabane in  each of the last three financial years. <a name=AQO4196/08>(AQO  4196/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Western Health and Social  Care Trust provided Glenside Adult Training Centre in Strabane with the  following funding during the past three financial years: &pound;432,204 in 2008-09;  &pound;404,097 in 2007-08; and &pound;371,001 in 2006-07.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. Glenside Adult Training Centre provides  day-care support to profoundly disabled adults. At present, it has places for a  maximum of 10 adults and a waiting list of six adults who require special-needs  support. The current special-needs facility is a 23-year-old Portakabin. What  action will the Minister take to ensure that adults who have multiple  disabilities in the Strabane area will be provided with a facility that meets  their needs?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Glenside Adult Training  Centre receives funding from the Western Health and Social Care Trust. The  amount of money that is paid to the centre increases each year. The centre uses  those resources to provide valuable support to people in the area. It  facilitates 50 people who are aged between 19 and 70. Capital provision is a  matter for the trust, and I have created a capital priorities group that works  with it. The trust must come forward with capital projects and an ongoing  review to indicate its priorities in each trust area and criteria.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Adult training centres are the only respite available to many carers. Can the  Minister assure the House that those centres will remain in place and will all  be funded?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I agree entirely with Mrs  Bradley that respite care is absolutely essential in the areas of learning  disability and mental health. The Caring for Carers strategy operates to that  end and is kept under review. That is an important piece of work. Members will  recall my struggle to obtain funding for mental health and learning disability  in the Budget allocations. The provision of respite-care packages is a key part  of that. The packages that the Department has been able to add to its  allocation will provide respite for around 800 people.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">NHS Surgery Targets: Private Procedures</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">9. <strong>Mr  Buchanan </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  how many patients referred through the NHS are having their surgical procedures  carried out in private hospitals to meet departmental targets, broken down by  Health and Social Care Trust area.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO4191/08>(AQO  4191/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: A breakdown of health and social  care patients who are treated in private hospitals is not available in the form  that the Member requests. In 2006-07, 5,353 inpatient day-case patients were  managed by the independent sector. A significant proportion of those patients  were managed in health and social care facilities as part of waiting-list  initiatives to improve access to outpatient, diagnostic and surgical  procedures. The use of the independent sector has been essential to allow the  Health Service to tackle the significant backlog of patients who must wait for  prolonged periods for treatment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. What good follow-up practices are in  place for patients should any complications occur following surgery? How much  does it cost the Department each year to carry out that surgery in private  hospitals and clinics?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: In the summer of 2005, 47,000  patients were waiting for surgical procedures, and some of those patients had  been waiting for several years. In April 2006, 110,000 people had been waiting  for more than three months for an outpatient appointment, and some people had  been waiting for more than five years. That position was totally unacceptable,  and a wide range of measures was put in place, including the involvement of the  independent sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In April 2006, 110,000 outpatients were waiting for more  than 13 weeks for a first appointment. That waiting list has now completely  disappeared, and no one is waiting for an appointment. Ten thousand people were  waiting for over 21 weeks for inpatient or day-case treatment, but no one now  waits for over 21 weeks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Tremendous progress has been made on what was a burning  issue for all of Northern    Ireland, which is to the credit of the  service. The Health Service is providing backup and support.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I commend the Minister for ensuring that waiting lists have continued to drop  over the past 12 months since he became Minister. That is a sure sign that the  Ulster Unionist Party is delivering for all the people of Northern Ireland.  Does the Minister agree that, if he had listened to, and taken the advice of,  the whingers on some of the Benches during the Budget discussions in the autumn  of 2007, he would not now be in a position to continue to fund those decreasing  waiting lists? Therefore, I praise him for ignoring such advice and for his  determination in continuing to put patients first through renewed investment in  the Health Service.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I can answer yes, yes and yes to  the Member&rsquo;s question.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We obtained a significant increase in allocation as a  result of the arguments and consultations that I took to the people of Northern Ireland.  I received a huge response and enormous support for those consultations. I am  aware that I have the support of the general public in Northern Ireland  in finding resources for the Health Service. It is the number one priority for  people. Progress on waiting times has been significant, and tens of thousands  of patients have gained from the massive improvements in waiting times over the  past three years. I will continue to work to achieve further improvements.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">After-School Projects</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">10. <strong>Mr B  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for  his assessment of funding for after-school projects after June 2008. <a name=AQO4269/08>(AQO 4269/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: In November 2006, responsibility  for childcare transferred to the Department of Education, leaving my Department  only with statutory responsibility for children in need, as defined under the  Children (Northern Ireland)  Order 1995 and the regulation of certain childcare settings.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department&rsquo;s involvement in the support of after-school  provision has been solely to act as a funding mechanism for centrally earmarked  resources. However, rather than abandoning the schemes at the end of this  month, I have committed over &pound;400,000 from the health budget until the end of  this year to allow time for departmental responsibility to be clarified and to  give the after-school projects time to find other sources of funding or to put  in place a planned timetable for closure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">After-school projects are not, and have never been, the  policy function of my Department. Therefore, I am not in a position to help any  further after the end of this year. My own view is that they sit inside the  definition of extended schools, but that is for others to decide.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer, and I assure him that Mr McCallister&rsquo;s  decision to wear a pink tie is not an attempt to upstage Gerry Adams, but to  raise the important matter of breast cancer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also thank the Minister for putting his hand in his  pocket on two occasions in order to ensure that there was funding for  after-school clubs. Does he agree that it is a disgrace for the Sinn F&eacute;in  Minister of Education to wilfully abandon children in need by refusing to fund  projects that play such a valuable role in local communities?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Of course, Mr McCrea and the  House would not expect me to comment on an Executive colleague; however, I can  restate the position in which I found myself when I was faced by the closure  of, for example, 55 after-school projects.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Having worked in inner South Belfast,  I know how small groups that work on small amounts of money are affected, and,  therefore, I stepped forward. I also supported part of the now-defunct  children&rsquo;s fund, on the understanding that I would have to bid for those  moneys.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Historically, the Health Department did not provide such  funds, but merely acted as a facilitator for the provision of funds &mdash; it acted  as a conduit, or go-between, between the Executive and various applicants. The  Health Department administered applications, but it did not provide money.  Therefore, other Departments must consider how to meet that need. Having worked  on the ground, I concur with the view of many Members that such projects &mdash; some  of which are run on sums as small as &pound;3,000 to &pound;5,000 &mdash; play a vital role in  disadvantaged communities.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 11 has been withdrawn.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Craigavon   Area Hospital:  Unannounced Inspections</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">12. <strong>Mr  Simpson </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to  detail all unannounced inspections that have been carried out at Craigavon Area Hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO4256/08>(AQO 4256/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: In March 2008, the Regulation  and Quality Improvement Authority carried out an unannounced inspection of  hygiene standards, and, in 2006-07, two unannounced audits of environmental  cleanliness standards were carried out by consultants KPMG. In addition, trust  managements undertake regular unannounced audits, as required by the  Cleanliness Matters strategy, and the Southern Health and Social Services  Council conducts Bugwatch surveys.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  I wish to place on record the commitment of everyone at Craigavon Area   Hospital to ensure that  it leads the Province in that and other areas of understandable public concern.  Will the Minister give favourable consideration to the trust&rsquo;s funding bids for  initiatives such as rapid-response cleaning teams?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I announced response packages to  hospital-acquired infections, and rapid-response cleaning is included in one of  those. Craigavon and other hospitals are working on that. As a result of the  RQIA audit and report, Craigavon   Area Hospital  has put in place, and is working through, an action plan.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sharing best practices amongst hospitals and trusts is another  key matter on which we are working. With regard to resources, in January this  year, I made &pound;9 million available for such measures. That was not the first  amount of money that I made available, and I am prepared to provide whatever  funds are necessary to drive hospital-acquired infection rates to as low a  level as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Clostridium difficile and MRSA are in the population, and  it is not possible to eradicate them; however, through the prudent use of  antibiotics, hand hygiene, environment cleaning, isolation nursing, and  personal protection by staff, we intend to maintain infection rates at low  levels.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Review of Regional Development Strategy</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr W  Clarke </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development how he intends to  proceed with the fundamental review of the regional development strategy; and  what involvement those working outside government will have in terms of shaping  the new framework.&nbsp; <a name=AQO4296/08>(AQO 4296/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: In my statement to the Assembly on 9  June, I said that I want the review to be inclusive and that I want to hear,  and benefit from, a wide range of views and opinions. I have set up an external  working group, which includes individuals representing business, trade unions,  the voluntary and community sector and councils, and its first meeting was held  on 4 June. I am also considering how to engage with local groups as the review  develops to ensure that the process is fully inclusive. External involvement  and maximum public participation are central to the fundamental review of the  regional development strategy, and I will continue to keep mechanisms for  maximising that potential under consideration.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I congratulate the Minister on Armagh&rsquo;s win over Down in yesterday&rsquo;s Gaelic football  game. I thank the Minister for his response to my question. What is the role of  the external working group?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Unfortunately, I had no role to play in Armagh&rsquo;s win over Down, other than to turn up and cheer  them on. Nevertheless, I am sure that the people in the county of Armagh  are happy to hear such an acknowledgement from a Down supporter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The purpose of the external working group is to act as a  sounding board as the policy on the 2010 review of the strategy is developed.  That group comprises individuals who represent business; trade unions; the  voluntary and community sector; the environmental sector; rural communities;  house builders; academia; planning professions; social and equality groups;  language organisations; cross-border networks; and local government. A very  constructive first meeting took place on Wednesday 4 June, and the intention is  for subgroups to be set up to consider particular aspects of the review, which  will meet in the early autumn.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for the second part of his response &mdash; I am not so sure  about the first part, but that is by the by.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister confirm that sanctions are in place to  ensure that developers deliver on their commitments to provide new finished  roads and street lighting? Such matters are clearly an essential part of any  new framework and regional development strategy for the Province.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Developers who undertake housing developments, in  particular, have contractual arrangements with Roads Service. Until those  arrangements are fulfilled, Roads Service will not adopt roads, footpaths or  street lighting. In other words, it will not adopt roads if they are not up to  a certain standard. Roads Service can either introduce sanctions to ensure that  the builder delivers to that standard, or withhold the bonds that are paid with  respect to the developing of roads before a project is started.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The regional development strategy is a much broader  strategy that deals with development across the Six Counties and beyond &mdash; there  is a very advanced level of development across the island, and further co-operation  is needed. Rather than deal with individual concerns, the strategy will operate  at a much higher level. We are working to address issues such as compliance  with the regional development strategy. The review will involve an external  working group, a group of very senior civil servants and a ministerial  subcommittee. I will work with ministerial colleagues, particularly the  Minister of the Environment, to ensure that planning and enforcement processes  fit in with what the Executive will eventually conclude to be the regional  development strategy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Ahead of the production of any revised regional development strategy, will the  Minister confirm that the Narrow Water Bridge  project and the proposed motorway to Derry  will proceed as priority projects, irrespective of any future discussions?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: It might help to point out that the regional  development strategy is not about specific projects, so it will not have a  bearing on the two projects that the Member mentions. I can confirm that it is  not in my gift to deliver on the Narrow   Water Bridge  project, as the Member will know from my previous responses to questions on  that subject. Louth County Council has undertaken that project, under the  direction of the Dublin Government. The regional development strategy is about  overall regional policy. It will involve the fundamental rewriting of the  original &lsquo;Shaping our Future&rsquo; document to develop a strategy that takes us up  to 2025, and that takes into account the rapid rate of change over the past  years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not about specific projects. However, I can confirm  that the roads project between Belfast and Derry &mdash; for which I am responsible &mdash; will progress  according to plan and schedule.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Urban Regeneration: Co-operation</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr B  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what co-operation takes  place among Translink, Roads Service and the Department for Social Development  in relation to urban regeneration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO4307/08>(AQO  4307/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Roads Service has worked closely with the Department  for Social Development officials and other interested parties on a number of  projects associated with urban regeneration. For example, Roads Service was  recently involved with the Department for Social Development and Translink in  implementing environmental improvements in lower Chichester Street, Belfast.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service also contributed professional and technical  expertise to the selection process and negotiations with prospective developers  on proposed development schemes in Coleraine, Enniskillen and Holywood. In  addition, Roads Service manages the implementation of a significant proportion  of the environmental improvement and public-realm schemes, which the Department  for Social Development (DSD) funds in towns in the North. Roads Service is  currently a consultee in the Belfast  public-realm Streets Ahead project, on which it is represented at different  levels to ensure that the project is designed and implemented to conform to the  required specifications for road safety, street-lighting materials, drainage  and construction. Translink is also involved in that project, because the  proposals have significant implications for city-centre bus operations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members may be aware that the Belfast metropolitan transport plan identifies  several key projects for the city centre. Moreover, a working-group structure  is operating with representation from all key stakeholders, including Roads  Service, DSD, Translink and Belfast City Council, to co-ordinate the proposals  and ensure best practice. That is an ongoing process, and I assure Members that  Roads Service will continue to work with all parties to ensure that the best  service is provided to the public, with minimal disruption during the delivery  of public-realm improvements.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his explanation of best practice. Will he undertake to  raise with his Executive colleagues how valuable the Laganside Corporation is  as a role model for the Maze regeneration project in an attempt to break  Ministers&rsquo; inaction, which is currently preventing the development of that  important site?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: That area is not my responsibility. The Department  for Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) and the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) are responsible for those projects. However, I  assure the Member that, if and when that important project is brought to the  Executive for discussion, Roads Service will play its part in its development.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 4 has been withdrawn.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Gortcorbies Climbing Lane</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr G  Robinson </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what progress has been  made on the Gortcorbies climbing lane.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO4194/08>(AQO  4194/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Gortcorbies climbing-lane scheme, on the A37  Limavady to Coleraine road, is part of the Northern Ireland road safety  strategy, which allocates &pound;374 million to deliver local road improvements and  road safety schemes between 2002 and 2012. The scheme will improve overtaking  opportunities for Coleraine-bound traffic.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, Roads Service has advised that it has encountered  substantial environmental issues around the disposal of 100,000 cu m of surplus  material from the construction scheme. As a result, Roads Service is examining  an alternative design &mdash; widening the embankment parts of the scheme &mdash; to reduce  the amount of surplus material that is used. It is also examining the best  method to connect a local road to the new design. Therefore, I am currently  unable to provide a date for the commencement of the scheme.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Given that it is a major transport corridor for the north-west, will the  Minister give assurances that the scheme, and the Dungiven bypass, will  progress with haste, unlike the traffic in those areas?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The amount of surplus material requiring disposal  from the climbing-lane scheme presented Roads Service with a particular  problem, which it is working hard to overcome in order to get the scheme back  on track. On several occasions, I have said in the House that Roads Service  recognises the congestion and pollution that the through traffic from Belfast to Derry causes  in Dungiven. We intend to deal with that issue through the construction of a  bypass as soon as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister provide an update  on the bypass at Ballykelly?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Several possible corridors are being examined, and,  this summer, I hope to announce the selection of a preferred corridor.  Subsequently, Roads Service will examine a range of possible routes in the  preferred corridor in order to select a preferred route for the new road.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  Has the Minister conducted any investigations across the Province on how  improvements to the configuration of roads could reduce accidents and road  deaths? Furthermore, will he comment further on the Frosses Road near Ballymoney?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s original question referred to a road  which is part of a road safety scheme. A key element of investing in roads is  to improve road safety and to reduce the all-too-frequent deaths on our roads.  Roads Service has responsibility for that issue; however, it cuts across the  Department of the Environment and the Department of Education. Enforcement  issues are also a key part of the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the Frosses Road, not so long ago I had a  meeting with some Members from North Antrim  and told them that we were moving towards the idea of a preferred route option.  I hope to make an announcement on that in the near future.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Emerald Fund: Motorway Infrastructure</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  Burnside </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development if he is making any  bids for additional moneys from the Emerald Fund to construct motorway  infrastructural links at key economic locations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO4199/08>(AQO 4199/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I will not make any bids for additional resources  from the Emerald Fund to construct motorway infrastructural links at key  economic locations.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  That is a very disappointing response. I am not clear how much money has been  invested in the Emerald Fund, but the Minister could bid for some moneys as a  way of dealing with his Department&rsquo;s problems. He comes to the House time and  time again and says that his budget allocation is not sufficient. For instance,  we are way behind spending in comparable terms with England. Surely the Minister and  his Department should take the initiative and request millions of pounds from  the Emerald Fund for cross-border strategic motorway dualling or simply for  improving the roads between the North and South. I find it amazing that he is  not participating in bidding for those available moneys.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I welcome the Emerald Fund&rsquo;s commitment to invest in  the development of public and private infrastructure across Ireland. The  Emerald Fund will provide further financing options for the private sector to  develop infrastructure, and that may include public sector infrastructure  projects, such as contracts to construct motorway infrastructural links at key  economic locations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the Department&rsquo;s ability to tap into the  Emerald Fund, the provisions of the budgeting framework mean that borrowing  from the fund will result in a reduction in the capital funding that the  Executive receive from the Treasury. Therefore, the overall net spending power  will not be enhanced. Borrowing from organisations such as the Emerald Fund and  the European Investment Bank are not free, as the loans must be repaid with  interest. Therefore, even if the borrowing did not result in a reduction of  funding received from the Treasury, the Executive still need to consider the  longer-term implications for public finances.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  The Minister will be aware of the successful economic hub that is being  generated around Tesco and IKEA at the Holywood Exchange, where planning  permission has just been granted. What plans does the Minister have to  alleviate the traffic congestion that occurs as a result of the successful  trading in that area?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: There are plans to try to improve the flow of traffic  around the Sydenham bypass to take account of the significant developments in  the area, including the expansion of the airport. There is a significant  developer-led element to those plans. We have considered the early plans, and  we hope to implement some of them in the near future.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Could an application be made to any fund, other than the Emerald Fund, to help  the development of the Dungiven bypass, as the problem seem to be worsening  every day?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: As I said in an earlier reply to George Robinson, it  is our intention to start work on that scheme as soon as possible using our own  resources. The problem is not that there are no funds to carry out the work &mdash;  it is that one must go through the relevant statutory processes to design a  major roads project. The people who live in and around Dungiven have rights, as  do the people whose land will be acquired to construct the bypass. Furthermore,  the environment must be considered. Those issues take time to go through the  relevant statutory processes, but work will begin as soon as possible.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  On the subject of the Emerald Fund, what is the Minister&rsquo;s assessment of the  impact that the Republic&rsquo;s unfortunate decreasing tax receipts will have on the  Irish Government&rsquo;s intention to fund road projects in Northern Ireland? I had  hoped that Southern funding would make its way into the road network in the  Strangford constituency.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I suppose that one way of pursuing that is to bring  about constitutional change so that we can have one budget for all our roads. I  welcome any support that the Member might give me in that regard.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Dublin Government has committed funds to two roads  projects &mdash; the A5 Derry to Aughnacloy road and the A8 Belfast to Larne road.  That commitment still stands, and there has been no reduction in that  commitment. We have not discussed support for any further roads projects with  the Dublin Government, but I assure the Member that if there is any possibility  of such support, we will certainly avail of it.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">School Buses: Road Safety Features</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  Dallat </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to detail the revised  plans in place to allocate &pound;3&middot;4 million to Translink to enhance road safety  features on school buses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO4230/08>(AQO  4230/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: My Department was allocated &pound;3&middot;4 million to enable  Translink to introduce signage and lighting in school buses in 2007-08 on the  understanding that new legislation for signage and lighting on buses would be  in place. However, the regulations, which fall within the remit of the  Department of the Environment, have not yet been introduced. In accordance with  the guidelines, the money was surrendered to DFP for reallocation. My  Department will bid for the required funding to be available for use in  2009-10, when the regulations will come into effect.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Without blaming the Minister, does he agree that it is an absolute disgrace  that &pound;3&middot;4 million for signage on school buses was lost at a time when there  have been so many fatal accidents involving school buses? Will he assure the  House that, in future, he will insist that the Department of the Environment  has the legislation and the technical data in place to ensure that when money  is available to improve road safety for schoolchildren, it will be used for  that purpose?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I assure the Member that, having made a bid for the  money, we are keen to carry out the project. The Minister of the Environment  has advised me that the regulations are novel and technically complex, and, as  a result, drafting has taken longer than anticipated. Under the guidelines, we  had to surrender the money to the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP).  However, we will make a bid for that money in order to carry out the project in  2009-10.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister give details of  what Translink is doing in the meantime to increase safety features on school  buses? Is he able to give the House a sense of the degree of co-operation  between his Department and the Department of Education on safety measures for  the fleet of buses that are used by the Department of Education?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Translink has introduced measures to improve safety  on buses used for school transport. Those include the fitting of large yellow  warning signs to the rear of buses, and the installation of bumper cameras,  which allow the driver to view the front of the vehicle on his monitor for up  to 30 seconds after the door of the bus has closed. Furthermore, all buses  recently purchased by Translink have been fitted with a reflective rear strip.  A retrofit programme for that strip has also been put in place.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is correct when he says that co-operation is  required, not just between my Department and Translink, but with the Department  of Education, and, in this case, as the original question suggested, with the  Department of the Environment on the subject of regulations. Safety on school  buses, and on buses in general, is an issue that cuts across several  Departments. There is a good degree of co-operation with other Departments in  order to ensure that we achieve the highest standards of safety on buses, and  particularly on buses that carry schoolchildren.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Has the Minister given any consider&shy;ation to reducing speed limits on roads  outside schools? Furthermore, does he agree that not only the work that has  been done with Translink, but the installation of flashing signs at schools by  Roads Service, has improved safety for schoolchildren?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Road safety outside schools is a key issue, and  several pilot projects are in place to examine reductions in speed limits  outside schools for that purpose. The current thinking on such matters is that  permanent speed limits outside schools tend to be disregarded in the summer  months when the schools are closed, and that that becomes a pattern of  behaviour. Pilot projects are under way at several schools; I believe that  there is one in rural Antrim and one in rural Derry,  in Articlave. In those pilots, the traffic is limited to a speed of 20 mph at  peak times outside the school, but is not a permanent speed reduction.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We will examine closely the results of that pilot scheme to  establish whether it will provide an additional safety measure that we can roll  out for other schools. As the Member rightly said, there are other ways of  enhancing the safety of children outside schools.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answers to questions on road safety and buses. Will  he introduce a traffic regulation that forbids vehicles from overtaking school  buses that are temporarily stationary at bus stops?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: We will consider any measures that will improve road  safety, particularly those that concern buses. Bus safety is a sensitive issue,  particularly as Members will recall the fatal accident that happened on the A4  several months ago, in which a young girl was killed. Some measures stray into  areas that are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment. We wish  to improve safety progressively, not only on buses and outside schools but also  when children are being transported to and from school.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 8 has been withdrawn.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Water Charges</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">9. <strong>Mr  Gallagher </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what sectors and  groups have been liable for water charges since April 2008.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO4303/08>(AQO 4303/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I have been advised by Northern Ireland Water that,  from 1 April 2008, all non-domestic customers have been subject to water and  sewerage charges and to trade-effluent charges, where applicable. Non-domestic  customers include farms; small, medium and large businesses; industrial users;  voluntary organisations; charities; public bodies; places of worship; and any property  that is not intended for permanent household use.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Does the Minister accept that although churches and church properties are  exempt from rates, there is much concern that they have to pay water charges?  Does he agree that there is a much better system in Scotland, where such properties do  not pay water charges? As the Minister knows, water charges will be passed on  to parishioners by parish and church committees. Will he look again at water  charges with a view to introducing exemptions for church properties?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Executive accepted the independent water review panel&rsquo;s  recommendation that billing for water and sewerage services should be extended  to all non-domestic properties from 1 April 2008, and they decided that that  should be phased in over two years, with customers paying 50% of the full  amount in 2008-09 and 100% of it from 2009-10. Accordingly, all non-domestic  premises have been billed for water and sewerage services since April 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Places of worship are classed as non-domestic, and many  have been paying metered water charges for many years. Before the extension of  non-domestic payments, Northern Ireland Water was already billing some 1,200  church properties. It remains company policy to extend metering for billing  purposes throughout the non-domestic sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To answer the Member&rsquo;s question, the Executive considered  the independent water review panel&rsquo;s recommendations. I note that when the  panel&rsquo;s report was published, his party colleague said that it represented the  central plank of SDLP policy on the issue. Therefore, I am surprised that  members of that party have difficulty with it. Nonetheless, the Executive  considered &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  That is absolutely wrong.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The comment was made that it was the central plank of  SDLP policy. I am afraid that it is a matter of public record. Either the party  did not read &mdash; or did not understand &mdash; the independent panel&rsquo;s report, or else,  as seems to be the case, it is trying to distance itself from decisions that it  has already signed up to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The independent panel&rsquo;s report was carefully scrutinised by  the Committee for Regional Development, and the church issue was not raised at  the time, nor was it raised at the Executive when the matter was voted on and  agreed last October.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I say again that the Executive decided the policy; it has  been through all the processes. I saw a press release that was issued by the  Member&rsquo;s colleague Mr Dallat in which he complained that the issue was not  debated. I made a statement to the Assembly on the implications of the panel&rsquo;s  report, and we had a full debate on the matter; again, the church issue was not  raised.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, either people have not read or understood the  report, or perhaps it is more likely that they are being disingenuous and  trying to distance themselves from decisions to which they signed up earlier.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  The word of God tells us that we should:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are  Caesar&rsquo;s&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If the Minister continues down the path that he is  on, it is most likely that he will become known as the Minister who put a tax  on baptism, whether by sprinkling or total immersion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that many small rural congregations work within very  tight budgets and that their facilities are used for community activities such  as mother-and-toddler groups, does the Minister agree that the negative impact  of the imposition of water charges on such communities will be greater than any  direct positive benefit that might be accrued by the additional revenue?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I appreciate the Member&rsquo;s concerns. I would not dare  try to specify how much water should be used in baptism &mdash; that is not my field  at all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the Executive unanimously signed up to the  introduction of billing to all non-domestic properties, we were aware that the  decision would create hardship for some sectors. Nonetheless &mdash; as I said to Mr  Gallagher &mdash; 1,200 church properties were already being billed and had been for  many years. If, as Mr Gallagher argued should happen, one particular sector is  exempted from the charge, the rest of the non-domestic sector will carry the  cost. The panel recommended, and the Executive concluded, that the fairest way  forward was to charge all non-domestic customers.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>:  What is the Department&rsquo;s position on charging country churches for mains  drainage even when they do not have any sewerage facilities?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: If a property is not connected to the mains sewerage  system, it should not be billed for sewerage services. I do not doubt that  mistakes will be made in the first run of this process. People will, perhaps,  receive bills that they have no requirement to pay. We have provided a hotline  that MLAs can use if people have been in contact to say that they have got a  bill that does not reflect the services that they receive. If people receive  incorrect bills &mdash; and I am aware of one or two such cases &mdash; they can challenge  them, and the water company will move to correct the problem.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">10. <strong>Mr  Brolly </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what action his  Department, non-departmental public bodies and agencies are taking under the  European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO4316/08>(AQO 4316/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I have recently reviewed compliance by my Department  and its agency, Roads Service, with the European Charter for Regional or  Minority Languages. I have implemented the following changes to promote the use  of the Irish language: the translation into Irish of all ministerial forewords  to plans, reports and consultation documents; a translation of all new or  revised information leaflets into Irish; the development of a multilingual  website for the Department; the publication of significant announcements in an  appropriate Irish-language newspaper; the use of bilingual headings in the  advertising of all public notices; the identification of Irish speakers in DRD  to help handle telephone calls in Irish; and a revised code of courtesy on  Irish and Ulster Scots for all staff.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, my Department has prepared a draft policy for  the introduction of a range of bilingual road signs in response to the European  Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. NITHCo, Translink, the Port of Belfast,  Derry Port and Harbour Commissioners,  Warrenpoint Harbour Authority and Northern Ireland Water all fulfil their  requirements under the charter. Those organisations allow users of regional or  minority languages to submit requests in those languages and provide  translation or interpretation as may be required. They also allow the use or  adoption of family names in the regional or minority languages at the request  of those concerned. Translink is reviewing what information may be most  usefully provided in Irish, including educational material for schoolchildren.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  What Irish-language groups has the Minister met, and what was the nature of  that engagement? What is his assessment of Armagh&rsquo;s  chances in its future encounter with Fermanagh?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Minister may answer any of those questions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I will deal with the questions that I know something  about. I have met representatives from Irish-language groups Pobal, Conradh na  Gaeilge and Comhaltas Uladh in February and June to discuss issues relating to  the charter. Their views helped to inform the review. As the Member will know,  we have an obligation under the European Charter for Regional or Minority  Languages to make provision for those languages and to ascertain where such  provision can be made within the Department. In my discussions with those  groups, it was useful to see where we provide good support and where we can do  better. I am more than willing to improve our service wherever we can.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Regarding the latter part of the Member&rsquo;s question, all  that we can do is hope.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Social Housing: Community Heating Projects</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  Gardiner </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development whether she will review  the provision of community heating projects in all new social housing schemes,  particularly those based on willow burning technology.&nbsp; <a name=AQO4205/08>(AQO 4205/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: Recent increases in fuel costs, together  with our desire to promote more environmentally friendly and sustainable forms  of energy, mean that it is imperative that we keep the issue of renewable  energy under constant review. Although no community heating scheme using willow  burning is planned, I am aware of the work that is ongoing on that technology  in the private sector, and I will monitor developments closely to identify the  potential for the social-housing rented sector.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her reply. Given the recent rise in oil and gas  prices, which are likely to escalate further, has the Minister assessed the  potential for developing such community heating schemes on existing housing  estates?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: As recently as last Saturday, I visited an established  housing estate in Ballynahinch &mdash; in my constituency of South Down &mdash; in which  wood pellet boilers were installed recently. I talked to some local residents  and to the person who installed the boilers on behalf of the Housing Executive.  Those people were content with the heating system; they said that the boilers  were cost-effective, and they found the heat that flowed from them to be  beneficial.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gardiner raised another important issue &mdash; fuel poverty &mdash;  and I welcome the opportunity to address it, although several Departments have  cross-cutting responsibility for the matter. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment has  responsibility for energy policy and prices; the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister has responsibility for poverty; and my Department has  responsibility for energy efficiency in the home. I was so concerned about the  effect of fuel costs on vulnerable households that I took the lead and  established a task force on fuel poverty to find short-term measures to keep  people warm this winter. That work falls into four main areas, and I want the  four groups that are dealing with each area to report to me soon. That will  enable me to present a paper to the Executive, and it is hoped that they will support  me in my request for further financial resources.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  What action is the Minister taking to encourage the Northern Ireland Housing  Executive to introduce renewable energy &mdash; particularly wood-burning technology  &mdash; in its properties?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I assure the Member that the Northern Ireland Housing  Executive has been encouraged and supported by myself and the Department to  implement renewable technologies. As I explained, I saw a good example on  Saturday of its implementation through the installation of wood-pellet boilers.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her comments; I am sure that her constituents in  Ballynahinch feel that they have done well &mdash; despite the fuel poverty that  others are suffering. She mentioned the task force that has been established to  find measures that will assist the vulnerable in the short term. Are the  Executive doing anything to look at the longer term? The Minister listed the  Departments that have short-term respons&shy;ibilities, but to what extent is the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development involved in the growing of  biomass, which could be developed for the good of areas beyond Ballynahinch?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Several Departments have responsibilities. The fuel  poverty task force has representatives from various Departments &mdash; including  DETI and DARD &mdash; the industry regulator, and representatives from the Consumer  Council and the industry. I want them to propose short-term measures that will  deal with the problems that will confront everyone this winter, but especially  those in the low- to medium-income groups and the elderly and disabled. That is  our most immediate challenge.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the task force&rsquo;s findings will benefit people  across Northern Ireland,  and I want to ensure that it has the full support of everybody. However, I  think that it does have the support of all, because the Executive and Members  recognise how important it is to have schemes that will enable people to keep  warm in the short term. Long-term measures will be considered in the next three  years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth noting that I have invested &pound;35 million over  the next three years in the warm homes scheme to deal specifically with that.  Taking on board the Audit Office report, I have already refocused the warm  homes scheme to look at the issue of need and to target resources at it.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Social and Affordable Housing: West Tyrone</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  McElduff </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development to detail the additional  social and affordable housing projects she has planned for the West Tyrone  constituency, given the acute need for social and affordable housing in both  the Omagh and Strabane districts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO4312/08>(AQO  4312/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Having visited Omagh last year after the flooding that  affected the area, I am aware of the housing need in the Member&rsquo;s constituency.  I also visited Lisanelly and St    Lucia, and, after the summer break, I plan  to launch our next shared-future housing development in Sion Mills. West  Tyrone&rsquo;s housing problems are well known to me.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We will build 160 new homes in West Tyrone in response to  that need, and those homes are planned over the next five years. Those homes  will complement the re-letting of the area&rsquo;s existing homes, which last year  alone resulted in 305 families being allocated houses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I could have told Mr McElduff about that when I met him at  the epic Down v Tyrone game on 14 June at P&aacute;irc Esler. As the Member will  recall, that game resulted in a magnificent victory for Down. Given yesterday&rsquo;s  events in Clones, however, I do not wish to labour that point.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Will the Minister withdraw that remark, please? <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My question will not be derailed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  You have no railway either.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  That is a very good point from Mitchel McLaughlin.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister detail how much additional money for  social- and affordable-housing projects the Executive Budget has allocated her  Department? Is it the case that all that money has been, or is being, used to  provide additional social and affordable housing? I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s  visits to West Tyrone, but, nonetheless, that figure of 160 houses is a mere  drop in the ocean.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: As Mr McElduff will be aware, when the draft Budget was  originally presented, the Department for Social Development received a very  light budget from the then Minister of Finance and Personnel. In spite of  barbed comments from across the House that I should accept the budget that I  had been allocated, I was unwilling to do so. After research, analysis and a  considerable weight of negotiations, very strong representations were made, and  the Department received an additional &pound;203 million.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am determined to deliver the new housing agenda and see  its impact across the North, irrespective of geographical or constituency  location.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer to the previous question. Building 160  houses in West Tyrone over five years is around 32 houses a year, which is not  an exorbitant number of houses for those in need. What plans does the Minister  have to bring the vacant housing stock in West Tyrone into circulation? If she  did that, the acute social- and affordable-housing need in the Omagh and  Strabane council areas would be quickly addressed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: As the Member will be aware, on assuming my ministerial  post in May 2007, I established an empty-homes unit. At that stage, the survey  that the Housing Executive undertook on my behalf, and that of my Department,  identified around 39,000 vacant homes. Further in-depth drilling-down and  analysis identified that around 5,000 of those houses could be allocated.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have worked with Land and Property Services over a  considerable period to identify the ownership of those particular houses, some  of which are in West Tyrone. I will continue to pursue that issue, and I will  ensure that those available houses in West Tyrone and in other constituencies  can be used for the purpose that the Member suggests.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>:  Everyone in the House appreciates how hard the Minister has worked to secure social  housing. I am sure that she is as disappointed as the rest of us to see that  housing receipts are down almost 95%.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister provide an update on the progress of the  rehabilitation of empty homes in the Province, and how many of them she expects  to bring into service during this financial year?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I refer the Member to my previous answer. Originally,  39,000 empty homes were identified by the survey that was undertaken by the  Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Further analysis has identified that 5,000  of those are capable of being restored. Land and Property Services has been  working with the Housing Executive to identify the ownership of those  properties. The first pilot exercise on that matter was undertaken in Banbridge,  and further pilot exercises are under way. That has taken a little longer than  expected.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that we will be able to utilise some of those  houses, particularly at interface areas in north Belfast. Last year, I had an opportunity to  visit houses at interface areas, and saw some that were around 10 years old. I  saw some houses that could be restored when visiting Tiger&rsquo;s Bay with Mr Cobain  several weeks ago. This matter should be finalised shortly.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Programme for Government Commitments: Update</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Ms Lo </strong>asked  the Minister for Social Development to provide an update on her Department&rsquo;s  commitments under the Programme for Government.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO4290/08>(AQO  4290/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am committed to ensuring that my Department meets its  obligations as set out in the Programme for Government. Procedures are in place  to monitor quarterly how we are progressing against the targets that have been  published in our corporate plan. The Programme for Government reporting period  started only in April, so monitoring information has not yet been collated.  That information will not be available until the end of August. I assure the  Member that I will be happy to provide her with a more detailed update at that  time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her reply. Under public service agreement 12, objective  2, the Department for Social Development holds lead responsibility for  delivering the neighbourhood renewal strategy, in co-operation with other  Departments. The Minister recently announced that she intends to transfer that  responsibility to local councils. How will the Minister ensure that councils  have overall responsibility across departmental bodies to enable the delivery  of all of the actions in the neighbourhood renewal plans?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Neighbourhood renewal is the Executive&rsquo;s flagship strategy  for addressing deprivation in local communities. If that strategy is supported  across Departments, there is a chance of success. If it is not adequately  supported by other Departments, it has a poor chance of delivering on its  objectives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As for transferring neighbourhood renewal to local  government, community development and local economic regeneration are being  transferred to local government under the review of public administration. That  makes perfect sense &mdash; decisions about targeting responses at local level should  be taken locally, not centrally. The equivalent scheme in the South of Ireland  is firmly entrusted to local government, through Revitalising Areas by  Planning, Investment and Development (RAPID).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no suggestion that the aim is to pass a problem to  local government. The policy lead will still remain with the Department for  Social Development, but the money &mdash; along with some staff resources and local  decision-making &mdash; will pass to the councils. I am aware that there are some  Members who are opposed to transferring neighbourhood renewal to local  government. Frankly, that is a nonsensical position.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Will the Minister clarify that there is nothing in the Programme for Government  that precludes spending on urban regeneration outside the cities of Belfast and Londonderry,  and that there is nothing in the Programme for Government that states that  every other town and city will receive only crumbs?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The Member is referring specifically to Lisburn, which  is in his constituency.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member will recall, I visited Lisburn in August or  early September 2007, and I saw the need and opportunities for vital regeneration  there. Regeneration proposals are already being implemented not only in Belfast and Derry but in other urban towns throughout Northern Ireland.  If the Member wants me to revisit Lisburn to consider specific examples of  where environmental improvement and public realm schemes could act as a lever  for investment, I would be happy to do so.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The warm homes scheme has been a useful method of alleviating fuel poverty,  which is one of the targets in the Programme for Government. However, the  Northern Ireland Audit Office (NIAO) recently criticised the scheme and  highlighted room for improvement. Will the Minister update the House on her  plans for, and the timescale involved in, a possible review of the scheme to  ensure that additional assistance can be provided to vulnerable families and  individuals?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Some months ago, I recognised how successful the warm  homes scheme had been in tackling fuel poverty throughout Northern Ireland  by insulating properties, and I decided, therefore, to refocus the scheme on  the fuel poor who are in most need. I also took the opportunity to establish  the fuel poverty task force. It comprises not only cross-departmental  officials, but representatives from the industry regulator, the General  Consumer Council and the fuel industry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is tasked with four specific areas of work: dealing with  the Government in London  to increase and refocus winter fuel payments; to ensure that my Department and  others make the best use of money; to secure a greater contribution from the  energy sector, and to ensure that the households that need help the most are  identified and targeted. The task force will report to me shortly, after which  I will take a paper to the Executive to ensure the buy-in of other Departments  that have a direct responsibility for energy tariffs.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 4 has been withdrawn.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Social and Affordable Housing: North   Belfast</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Ms N&iacute;  Chuil&iacute;n </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what action she was  taking to ensure equality of approach when addressing difficulties in the  provision of social and affordable housing in North   Belfast.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO4309/08>(AQO 4309/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: In considering the provision of housing, not only in  north Belfast  but throughout the North of Ireland, the level of need is my highest priority.  The Housing Executive is responsible for implementing the social housing  development programme and ensuring that investment is targeted at areas of  greatest need. I assure the Member that, in recent years, there has been more  investment in housing in North Belfast than in  any other constituency. However, I am conscious that there is more to be done.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her response. I know that she is aware of the housing stress  in North Belfast. However, having met several  housing associations and residents&rsquo; groups, I am concerned that the only  response to the housing problem in North Belfast  seems to be the construction of high-rise flats or apartments. Surely the  Minister accepts the need for mixed-tenure housing. I am concerned that more  housing inequality may be created in North Belfast.  Will the Minister respond to my concern?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am aware of the many housing issues in North Belfast because I have met various groups in the  area. I met the &ldquo;seven towers&rdquo; group, which has specific concerns about  high-rise housing and maintenance problems, and I met groups from St Patrick&rsquo;s  and St Joseph&rsquo;s, the &ldquo;long streets&rdquo;, Fortwilliam and Parkmount. I am conscious  of the need to address housing inequalities, and I want to ensure that everyone  in the House also rises to that challenge.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Girdwood site on the Crumlin Road has the potential to have a  major, positive impact on North Belfast, and  my Department&rsquo;s objective is to maximise the benefits for the people of that  constituency.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that all community, business, political and religious  leaders in the area will work together to help achieve that objective. I will  not allow those who oppose much-needed new housing on the Girdwood site for  sectarian or territorial reasons to stand in the way.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Will the Minister update the House on the situation regarding former Ministry  of Defence accommodation and its transfer to her Department?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: That question would be better directed to the Member&rsquo;s  party colleague, the First Minister. The Member may not be aware that following  my visit to the St Lucia and Lisanelly sites last year, I made strong  representations to the then First Minister and deputy First Minister and to the  Minister of Finance and Personnel and met with them to discuss the gift-aiding  of military sites to the Executive. Various representations were made by those  individuals to the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I  presume that those representations formed a part of the discussions held by the  Member&rsquo;s own party, and by the First Minister and deputy First Minister, with  the UK Government prior to the vote at Westminster  on detention of terrorist suspects for 42 days.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  The Minister has spoken of her approach to equality considerations. In the  context of the regeneration of the Crumlin Road Gaol and Girdwood sites in North Belfast, does she believe that all the political  interests are working together to that end?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Mrs Hanna for her question. I am conscious of  the need to address all the equality issues to which the proposals for the  regeneration of the site give rise. I recently re-opened the Crumlin Road Gaol  to visitors on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from 13 June to 12 September and  I urge all Members to avail of the opportunity to visit the site.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the Girdwood Barracks site, an equality  impact assessment is being carried out. My Department has written to 530  organisations and has embarked on a series of meetings with a range of groups  across North Belfast and further afield. On  foot of Mrs Hanna&rsquo;s question, I take the opportunity to encourage the elected  representatives of North Belfast &mdash; the MP, the  MLAs and city councillors &mdash; to work with us to achieve an outcome that benefits  all the people of the constituency. Again, I stress that I will not allow those  who oppose much-needed housing on the Girdwood site for sectarian or  territorial reasons to stand in the way. The issue is crucial to the people of North Belfast, and it must be speedily resolved.</p>

	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  Burnside </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development if funding allocated by  her Department will be linked to adherence by voluntary and community  organizations to her Department&rsquo;s code of governance for the voluntary and  community sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO4210/08>(AQO 4210/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The funding procedures applied by my Department  incorporate the principles and practice of good governance, espoused in my  Department&rsquo;s manual, &lsquo;Setting Standards, Improving Performance; Best Practice  in Finance and Governance in the Voluntary and Community Sector&rsquo;. My Department  seeks evidence of good governance from organisations throughout the funding  process. All funding proposals are subject to economic appraisal and evaluation  of their effectiveness and impact.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  The Minister will agree that the vast majority of voluntary and community  groups are doing a good job in difficult circumstances. She will also agree  that many groups have been, and still are, fronts for former republican and  loyalist terrorist organisations that are still heavily involved in  criminality.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does she believe that her Department&rsquo;s code of governance  and standards on the funding of local community groups is strong enough, strict  enough and can be sufficiently policed to prevent criminal organi&shy;sations from  extracting money through such groups?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I assure Mr Burnside that all voluntary and community  groups that receive funding from the Department for Social Development must  sign up to the terms and conditions of the grant. Naturally, however, I share  Mr Burnside&rsquo;s concerns about the matter. If he wishes to provide me with  specific details about a particular voluntary or community group in his  constituency or further afield, I would be very happy to consider them.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  As always, I thank the Minister for her response. Will she confirm that the  community and voluntary sectors are essential ingredients in social  development? Will she also confirm that a community charter and its aims need  not necessarily be those of DSD? Rather, the sector should be entitled to do  what is best for the community that it represents, and DSD should subsequently  evaluate each case individually to ascertain the merit of any plans and the  depth of the Department&rsquo;s involvement in that community aim, as opposed to each  community group simply being an extension of DSD, which is not their function.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I apologise to the Minister for asking a long-winded  question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: There are 4,500 groups in the community and voluntary  sector in Northern Ireland.  Some of those groups receive funding via neighbourhood renewal, which probably  requires buy-in from other Departments, or through the local community fund,  which comes directly from the Department for Social Development. However, some  groups also receive funding from local councils, and in Mr Shannon&rsquo;s case, that  is Ards Borough Council.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The community and voluntary sector is a large industry in Northern Ireland,  and I emphasise that it is very important that we focus resources where there  is most need.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Will the Minister address the wider question of the overall financial outlook  for the community and voluntary sector for the next three years? We are in the  midst of an economic downturn, groups are experiencing decreases in European  funding, and efficiency savings mean that other Departments are not stepping up  to the plate when it comes to neighbourhood renewal and making commitments to the  community and voluntary sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, what can the Minister do to ensure that DSD  funding has maximum impact on the ground? Additionally, what can be done to  gain more commitment and support from other Departments for the community and  voluntary sectors?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: My Department has the lead responsibility for the  voluntary and community sector. However, as the Member rightly points out,  funding to that sector is an issue for all Departments, which must work within  the terms of the Budget that the Executive set in the recent Programme for  Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Durkan is also correct to say that, after many years of  growth, we are entering a period of change and uncertainty for both sectors.  Sources of short-term funding, such as EU funding, on which the voluntary and  community sector in Northern    Ireland have come to rely, are decreasing.  It is difficult for all Ministers to strike the correct balance between finding  the funds that can be made available, to meet the requirements of the 4,500  voluntary and community groups in Northern Ireland, and to ascertain  the services that should be retained and developed. However, I assure my  colleague Mr Durkan that whatever refocusing may occur in neighbourhood renewal  in Derry, overall levels of DSD funding there  will be maintained or increased.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I know that some groups have lost out as a result of other  Departments&rsquo; choosing not to mainstream their projects. However, I can say only  that DSD will make every effort to support good work where it meets the  criteria for DSD-funded programmes. I will ensure &mdash; and I assure all Members of  this &mdash; that I will refocus the limited DSD funds that are available so that our  interventions and support have the maximum impact on the ground. Alongside  refocusing funding, I also hope to promote the spirit of volunteering and build  a stronger sense of self-reliance and social responsibility.</p>

	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes with concern that rising energy  costs are hitting families in Northern Ireland harder than in the rest of the  UK; and calls on the Executive to:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">(i) give further priority to measures to promote energy  efficiency and combat fuel poverty;</p>

	      <p class="Q3Motion">(iv) urge the UK Government to re-direct the windfall VAT  revenue from higher energy bills to be used to mitigate the escalation of fuel  poverty in Northern Ireland.  &mdash; <span class="Italic">[The Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mr  Durkan).]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the motion and commend  the Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment for tabling it. The motion provides Members with an  opportunity to reiterate their concerns about rising energy costs and other  issues, such as renewable energy and fossil fuels.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier in the debate, Simon Hamilton said that Members  must examine long-term and short-term solutions. I will focus on short-term  measures that the Executive and the Assembly must introduce.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion raises a number of points. First, it states  that, compared with elsewhere, in the North:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;rising energy costs are hitting families &hellip; harder&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is the starting point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls on the Executive to do certain things, one  of which, in point iv, urges:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the UK  Government to re-direct the windfall VAT revenue from higher energy bills to be  used to mitigate the escalation of fuel poverty&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">in the North of Ireland. The media have reported  that rising energy costs have led to the collection of an additional &pound;10  million in VAT. I want to make a connection between that extra &pound;10 million in  VAT revenue and the fact that, for all sorts of reasons, low-income families  here are hit harder, and are worse off, than those elsewhere.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want rising energy prices and the issues raised in point  iv of the motion to be put on the agenda for the Executive&rsquo;s next meeting &mdash; and  every meeting thereafter &mdash; until a result is achieved. The Executive must  inform the Assembly about the nature of their discussions on the motion. I hope  that they yield something positive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to raise the situation regarding oil companies,  which, I assume, the Executive will discuss. What is the situation with the oil  companies? Are they suffering now, or will they suffer in the future? We have  no control over what is happening globally, but we must question whether oil  companies&rsquo; profits will continue to soar while low-income families continue to  suffer. Will the disadvantaged become more disadvantaged?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Assembly Research and Library Service, and the  Committee, for providing Members with briefing papers, which state that the  trade union UNISON:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;condemned the blatant profiteering within the energy  industry&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That issue must be explored, even if we have no  control over the global situation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, we must also consider the regulator&rsquo;s role. Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  My contribution to the debate is hopefully more of a housekeeping issue because  of the severe rising costs of energy. Recently, we debated child poverty, and I  observed then that rising bills have meant that every family now has less  disposable income. I also highlighted the fact that energy costs in Northern Ireland are greater than those in the  rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was struck by two important points when reading the  motion. The first is the need to promote energy efficiency. I am sure that, in  our daily constituency work, many Members pass houses that have lights on in  every room. I often ponder whether all those rooms are occupied. A simple  message to pass on to our constituents is to switch off the lights when they  leave a room. Given the present circumstances, that message &mdash; and other similar  ideas &mdash; must be conveyed to every household in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is time for a co-ordinated campaign urging households to  be energy sensible and to help themselves to reduce their bills. Such an  approach would not only be a cost-effective means by which the Assembly could  promote and advise on careful energy use, but would have a real impact on those  people who are in fuel poverty or are at risk of it, by showing them how to  reduce their fuel bills. On 13 May, in the Assembly, my colleague from  Strangford Mr Shannon said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Those who most need that information are not getting  it, and it must be made available to help people to save money and to eradicate  fuel poverty, which is the aim of the Assembly.&rdquo; &mdash;<span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; "> [Official Report, Vol 30,  No 5, p303, col 1].</span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that Mr Shannon will be pleased to know that I  agree with those sentiments wholeheartedly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was also struck by the need to develop alternative and  renewable sources of energy. The Executive are in no doubt of the challenges  that they face, and are rising to those challenges:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Securing our future energy supply is high on the  Government&rsquo;s agenda as we seek to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.&rdquo; &mdash;<span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; "> [Official Report, Vol 30, No 5, p309, col 2].</span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those were the words of another colleague, the then  Minister of the Environment &mdash; it is ironic that, on that occasion, she was  filling in for the then Enterprise, Trade and Investment Minister, Mr Dodds. I  believe that the Executive are working positively towards achieving the target  of having 15% of energy production from renewable sources, and Minister  Foster&rsquo;s comments are proof of that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will save my energy and say nothing more than that I  support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I now call Dr Alasdair McDonnell.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  Thank you very much indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker &mdash; it is always a pleasure to be  invited to speak by your good self. I want to use the time allocated to me to  make a few points and to welcome the Minister to what I believe is the first  debate of this nature in the Chamber &mdash; I wish her well as Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and hope that we Back-Benchers can be helpful  and supportive to her in her new role.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome this debate, because rising energy costs are,  literally &mdash; if Members will excuse the pun &mdash; a burning issue for every  household in Northern    Ireland and beyond. It is an issue for  people across the island of Ireland and across the UK. We are facing an energy crisis,  which is being felt by every single business, household, school, church and  organisation in our society, because they all consume energy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As well as that, we are in the grip of a credit crunch, so  households are being hit in every direction. The cost of gas has risen by 28%  and the average bill is now close to &pound;600, which means an extra &pound;130 or &pound;140  being squeezed out of people&rsquo;s already tight budgets. The cost of electricity  has risen by 14% and we are told that, before the winter, it will increase  again by a further 15%. Diesel and petrol are at record high prices at the  pumps, and the price of home heating oil is scary &mdash; it is now 65% to 70% more  expensive than it was a year ago. On top of all that, people are facing a  credit crisis, rising rate bills, and the potential for water charges.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is against that backdrop that I warmly welcome the  motion. The Executive must take every possible action to address the energy  crisis, because all people are dealing with the same problems. I meet people in  my constituency every day &mdash; in my constituency office and on the streets &mdash; who  can no longer afford to fill their oil tanks. Some people, particularly the  elderly, are concerned, because usually they have a cushion &mdash; for example, a  half a tank of oil left over &mdash; but that will not happen next year. Instead,  many people let their tanks go empty in May and will try to leave them empty  for as long as possible so that they do not have to fork out &pound;600 or &pound;700 to  fill them. If we have a bad winter, the consequences will be horrific: people  will die because they will not be able to afford to heat their homes. Fuel  poverty, which is a nice clich&eacute;, will rise, and we will be faced with misery on  all fronts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the current problems are happening when oil is  $140 and $150 a barrel, we must be prepared for the price of oil to hit $250 a  barrel. It is unacceptable that major oil companies are making massive profits  at a time when people are being forced into misery and have to make a choice  between buying food and heating their homes. The oil market must be regulated.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In evidence from Phoenix Natural Gas, the Committee for  Enterprise, Trade and Investment heard that gas in the British market &mdash; which  we feed off &mdash; is traded six times before it is consumed. Therefore, four people  get a slice of profit before the gas reaches the consumer &mdash; there are four  people between the producer and the consumer. On the Continent, gas is traded  0&middot;6 times, because the process has been reduced to the point where there is no  trading in between the producer and the consumer. Regulation is essential &mdash; there  must be state control over, if not full state ownership of, the gas market.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although there is some control over the gas market, a  barrel of oil is traded 12 times before it is used, which means that there are  10 speculators. In the past few months, oil has become the favourite commodity  for traders, because the price keeps increasing &mdash; many people know that, if  they trade in oil, the price will continue to rise. My party leader, Mark  Durkan, and I, among others, have tabled an early-day motion at Westminster to highlight  that problem and to call for action at the G8 summit.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  There are many other points that I want to make. The Assembly and the Executive  must do all that they can to develop the use of renewables and other  alternative sources of energy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  I support the motion. My constituency, like those of other Members of the  House, has suffered because of the increase in fuel costs. That has been  brought home to me by several constituents, many of whom cannot afford to buy  oil for their central heating. I am extremely concerned about the impact that  rising fuel costs will have on elderly people this winter. All fuel prices &mdash;  including those for oil, electricity and gas &mdash; are increasing, which is  imposing considerable strain on families, particularly those on lower incomes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural  Development, I am aware of the impact that the increase in fuel costs is having  on the farming community. Higher oil prices have resulted in fertiliser prices  increasing by over 100%, and fuel costs have increased by over 50% in the same  period. Such rises in the cost of inputs explains why food prices are rising  and putting further pressure on people with low incomes. Increases in food  prices are having a serious impact on the household budget, especially for  families on low incomes and pensioners &mdash; the same people who face fuel poverty.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At a later date, the Assembly will debate renewable energy,  alternative land use and the impact that renewable energy will have on our  energy policy.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I believe firmly that oil prices will remain high, and,  regrettably, they will almost certainly increase further. It is vital that we  explore a way of developing an effective energy policy. That will require a  change in attitude across Departments, including in the Planning Service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In order to establish renewable energy projects, planning  policy must be changed significantly. Many farmers who have sought to develop  renewable energy projects have found the system to be fraught with  difficulties. Change in planning policy is required, but that need not have a  negative impact on the countryside.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for an effective energy policy, and it is  vital that we explore every opportunity to assist families during what are  challenging times. The Northern    Ireland energy market is almost totally  dependent on imported energy, and it is vital that a clear strategy is  developed &mdash; especially in the promotion of renewable energies &mdash; to enable us to  address our dependence on oil.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must also continue our pursuit of energy efficiency, which  could commence with the introduction of energy-efficiency certificates.  Although I am opposed to further red tape, I hope that the introduction of such  certificates would have a positive impact. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Given the increase in the price of oil and the impact that that is having  across the community, the motion is certainly topical. In conjunction with the  credit crunch and falling house prices, that increase is having a dramatic  effect on the economy, and it is being felt particularly badly in rural areas.  There is real decline in rural businesses, which are suffering, and, as a  consequence, people have been laid off. Given current levels of business, there  will be more layoffs in the near future because those employers cannot sustain  keeping all their employees.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Energy prices have an impact across the economy and on all  commodities. Unfortunately, that is demonstrated adequately by food prices in  supermarkets. As a consequence of high energy costs, more crops are being  diverted into energy crops as opposed to food crops, which then drives up the  price of food. Increases in the price of haulage also drive up the price of  food, given the number of vehicles that haul up and down the length and breadth  of the United Kingdom to move food from a to b. As a consequence, consumers pay  more for groceries, energy costs, keeping a warm home and travelling to work,  school, and so on. In all those areas, increasing fuel costs have negative  consequences on the average person on the street.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What can the Government and the Assembly do about that? A  policy can be set here and another at Westminster,  but other issues are outside the control of any Government. Dr McDonnell  referred to market-makers, and much of the increases in energy prices are to do  with market-making, as opposed to the regular bases of supply and demand.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We do not know when energy prices will stop rising. The  housing market has been in a similar situation: prices rose phenomenally over  the past three years, but they are now coming back down. I believe that the  same will happen with energy, but no one knows when the turning point will be.  In the meantime, the average punter on the street suffers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What can Government do to ease the situation? Reference has  been made to the VAT issue. For every 10p increase in energy prices, the  Government receive 1&middot;75p, which gives them approximately 6p more for each litre  of fuel than was the case just over one year ago. Clearly, without taking any  hit whatever, the Government could take 6p a litre off the price of fuel, which  would reduce the cost of haulage and travel, and, in a small way, would help to  alleviate some of the problems that consumers face. I lay that on the line: we  should press the Westminster Government to act immediately on the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the longer term, we must look at how we produce energy,  and there have been some innovative ideas. We must look at how the agriculture  industry uses willow biomass, not only for the production of electricity but  for heat and power exchange plants, the benefits of which &mdash; the supply of hot  water to hospitals, schools and leisure facilities or a newbuild town or  village &mdash; are clear. Recently, the first eco-village was opened in the  Brokerstown area of Lisburn. Houses in that development are bucking the trend  by selling well, which demonstrates that people recognise that energy issues  will continue to be a problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a Government, we must act to encourage the production of  more sustainable forms of energy. The island  of Ireland could produce enough  coastal wind power to serve all the United Kingdom. We must address  that. We should seek to ensure that the United Kingdom has a more reliable  source of energy &mdash; one that does not rely on areas where there can be political  turmoil or other problems &mdash; that will benefit our children.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  The causes of fuel poverty and rising energy costs are complex, multilayered  and interrelated. A downturn in the economy, which threatens to turn into  recession; the growing insecurity associated with the reliance on oil and  fossil fuels and their long-term sustainability; and environmental goals for  reducing climate change and changing greenhouse gas initiatives, are aspects  that must considered in the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Thousands of people in Northern Ireland are suffering from  the effects of rising energy costs. In the last year alone, oil customers have  paid &pound;532 more on average; Phoenix Natural Gas customers have paid &pound;132 more;  and NIE customers have paid &pound;69 more. One in three households is now suffering  fuel poverty, which means that families and individuals are either unable to  heat their homes or are forced to divert money for necessary items, such as  food and clothing, to pay for heating. The elderly and low-income families are  affected most. In a modern, democratic society, that is not acceptable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Governor of the Bank of England recently warned that  those price hikes are not temporary and that customers should brace themselves  for the most difficult economic conditions in two decades. Although this is a  complex issue, I welcome today&rsquo;s debate and hope that it produces the needed  momentum to stimulate action to address those issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Social Development is developing  strategies and taking steps to alleviate fuel poverty. Through the warm homes  scheme, the measures to increase heat retention and energy efficiency in homes  are extremely welcome. We should encourage people across society to implement  energy saving methods, including changing their behaviour. Society needs to  learn the necessity of conserving and retaining energy, and many people need  support to achieve that. We must ensure that the Executive give all the assistance  and information possible to those who wish to improve the efficiency of their  homes and businesses. It is crucial that as energy prices rise, we enable and  encourage people to use less energy for the same benefit. That will have  economic and environmental benefits.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to develop some of the issues that Dr McDonnell  raised to try to understand what has caused the present situation. There is a  world demand for fuels; India  and China  are rapidly expanding and, therefore, demand more of the fuels that used to  come to us. However, speculation is an issue that we must understand. Dr  McDonnell talked about gas being traded six times and oil 12 times, from the  time that it leaves the gas or oil field until it gets to our homes. The  present situation is not being caused by the speculators who normally operate  in that market; from evidence to the Committee, we understand that 50% to 60 %  of the speculation is being done by banks after they were hammered by the  American sub-prime mortgage market.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That has an effect in Europe and in the UK. As far as I  understand it, the banks are trying to make their money back through  speculation. All of that is in serious danger of wrecking our economy. In Great Britain,  83% of homes have access to natural gas. In Northern   Ireland, the figure is 25% in the greater Belfast area, and &mdash; lo and behold &mdash; 1% outside greater Belfast. The rest of Northern Ireland  is reliant on oil that is 12-times-traded by the time it gets here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are further confused by the fact that the energy  industry in the UK  is privatised. The rest of Europe and America have had much more sense  and have kept their energy industries in Government control in order to have  some control over them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have a major problem because fuel prices are rising,  which causes the costs of transport and food to rise. The biofuel issue has  further exacerbated the rise in the cost of food. In America, great swathes of the maize  crop have gone towards biofuel, which has caused a shortage for raising  animals. That also causes the price of food to rise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is also the issue of climate change. We are encouraging  people to make their homes more efficient. Wind power is an option, but &mdash; as I  have said previously in the House &mdash; our tourist trade will falter if we cover Northern Ireland  with windmills. My guess is that wave power is a good option. As Mr Newton  mentioned earlier, we must consider the nuclear option. We cannot close our  eyes and ears to something that everyone else is doing.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is almost up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  I commend the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Although the Assembly has limited scope to address such issues, rising fuel  costs are causing a considerable degree of anxiety for families and businesses  across the United Kingdom, the repercussions of which are being felt in all  aspects of our lives. There is tangible panic in the public domain, as well as  real despair, because, everywhere we turn, prices are rising faster than one  can say &ldquo;Jack Robinson&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The price of oil recently hit a new record of more than  $142 a barrel, after stock markets across the globe fell as a result of fears  regarding food and fuel costs. London Brent crude has now reached a record high  of $142&middot;13 a barrel, while US  light crude for August delivery has reached $142&middot;26 a barrel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a result, petrol prices have surged in the past year.  Diesel is 35% more expensive than one year ago, at 131&middot;94p a litre &mdash; nearly &pound;6  a gallon. Unleaded petrol has increased by 22%, at an average of 118&middot;57p a  litre. Each day at the pump, motorists are spending a colossal &pound;14&middot;3 million  more than they were one year ago. I am sure that everyone will agree that that  is a staggering increase.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Transport is an integral part of the delivery of goods and  services, so costs have inevitably filtered down to the high street, where each  and every family now feels the pinch. Farming food production is a major  contributor to the Northern Ireland  economy, more so than in any other region of the United Kingdom. Where agriculture  contributes 0&middot;5% towards the total GVA across the UK,  the figure is 1&middot;3% for Northern    Ireland. It, therefore, follows that  pressures in agriculture are felt twice as much in Northern   Ireland as they are across the United Kingdom as a whole.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland farmers also experience twice the  degree of hardship when it comes to the costs of feeds and grain. Across the United Kingdom, 28% of gross output is down to  the cattle, sheep, pig and poultry industries, while the same figure for Northern Ireland  is 43%. As a result, Northern    Ireland farmers have to purchase over twice  the amount of feedstuff as their mainland counterparts and must, therefore,  bear the costs of grain prices, which have exploded in recent months.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The prospects for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s fishing industry  are also very bleak. Successive Administrations have failed, on a colossal  level, to provide that industry with effective representation. It has now  declined to the point of collapse. Those are not empty words of woe but a  starkly honest picture of where the fishing industry currently stands.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Northern Ireland  fishermen observe their industry&rsquo;s decline, they must also witness the stark  contrast with which the Governments of France, Spain  and the Republic   of Ireland treat their  fishing industries. The cost of fuel and other overheads for some boats is as  much as &pound;2,700 a week, and that is before any wages are paid &mdash; in fact, I am  aware of owners who have to subsidise their vessels. Although that issue is not  specifically related to this debate; if the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development continues to fail to devote sufficient time to the matter, there  will not be a fishing industry to speak of come the next election.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past year, Northern Ireland has seen price  increases of 19% for electricity, 28% for natural gas and coal and 75% for oil  and, combined with other increases to household bills, that gives rise to  greater urgency to tackle fuel poverty. Ultimately, as long as the UK continues to depend on fossil fuels, we will  be at the mercy of Russia  and the Middle East. Northern Ireland  imports 96% of its energy needs &mdash; the highest in the European Union &mdash; and yet  the EU has said that no other country has more potential to produce alternative  energy on its farms.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Government may not have any control over the  level of oil production by OPEC, they do have control over the amount of  taxation levied on fuel. The United    Kingdom has the greatest tax burden on fuel  of any of the EU countries. The tax on of a litre of petrol in Britain is around 57p, compared to 31p in Spain, 45p in Italy,  48p in France and 52p in Germany. The Exchequer  has the power to reduce the cost of fuel. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the motion. Despite the attempted spin of the Labour Government,  no-one is in any doubt that times are hard and that the average person is  finding it difficult to make ends meet. First-time buyers and families with  young children are finding it particularly difficult to cope with housing  issues, and single-parent families are finding it hard to make ends meet. The  elderly are trying out retirement careers as contortionists &mdash; twisting and  stretching themselves to meet the ever-rising cost of living with small, and  seemingly shrinking, state pensions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Every day, headlines scream of rising bills and price  hikes. People have to tighten their belts that little bit more; and it is  becoming clear that there are no more notches on the belts of many people in  the Province. Bread has risen from 69p to &pound;1&middot;29, and diesel is at an all-time  high of 131&middot;99p a litre, which comes on top of bigger taxes on all incoming and  outgoing money. The hikes would be understandable if wages and incomes were  increasing at the same rate, but that is not the case. Older people are faced  with the choice of eating or heating &mdash; as has been said already &mdash; and that will  include more people who will put on extra blankets and jumpers to enable them  to spend money on meat.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland  has the highest rate of fuel poverty in the United Kingdom. The most up-to-date  figures show that in 2006, 34% of the population here was living in fuel  poverty. How much higher is that figure today? The mind boggles. The definition  of fuel poverty is not being able to keep a home adequately warm at reasonable  cost and that as a result more than 10% of household income is being spent on  fuel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alleviating fuel poverty has been identified by Government  as an important issue in tackling disadvantage in communities, and it is a  priority for the Assembly. &lsquo;Ending Fuel Poverty: A Strategy for Northern Ireland&rsquo;  published by the Department for Social Development in 2004, stated that the  Government intends:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to eliminate fuel poverty in vulnerable households by  2010, and in non-vulnerable households by 2016.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Is that possible today?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members have said already, in the past year Northern Ireland  has seen price increases of 19% for electricity, 28% for natural gas and coal,  and 75% for oil. Moreover, we have been told that electricity and gas will  increase by another 15% before the end of the year. God forbid that Alasdair  McDonnell is right and that oil prices will rise to $250 a barrel &mdash; that would  be horrendous.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There should be a greater urgency to tackle fuel poverty,  because of other increases in household bills. Margaret Ritchie has set up a  task force to examine fuel poverty and report to her by the end of the summer.  However, a strategy should be put in place as soon as is humanly possible. It  is admirable that our Ministers are playing their parts, but it is clear that  something must happen at the next level as a matter of urgency.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have reached the stage at which only action by the Prime  Minister, Gordon Brown, and the Labour Party can bring about a great enough  change to make a difference to the every-day lives of the people of the  Province, and the United Kingdom as a whole.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I shall focus on the last point of the motion, which reflects  my own contribution to a possible way forward, namely that the best option is  to charge the oil companies with windfall taxes. Those companies increase the  price of fuel every day, and yet, during the first three months of this year,  their profits rose by record amounts. To cite examples, in the first three  months of this year, Shell posted a profit of &pound;3&middot;9 billion; and British  Petroleum profits rose by 48% to &pound;3&middot;31 billion during the same period.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A 40% increase in profits for vital service provision is  nothing less than extortion, and price-gouging tactics should not be used  against the United Kingdom,  which is what is happening at the moment. The large oil companies need to be  penalised, and Gordon Brown could do more by hitting those companies with a  windfall tax, which could then be used to reduce the price of fuel by 12p or  15p a litre.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am all for free enterprise, but it is wrong that  companies are affecting the health and well-being of entire nations. It would  not be the first time that Gordon Brown has introduced a windfall tax. When the  Labour Party came to power in 1997, it imposed a one-off windfall tax on  utilities, and raised &pound;5 billion to fund the New Deal programme to get the  unemployed into work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Surely, 11 years later, the large oil companies, which are  boasting unbelievable profit margins, can be taxed in the same way. That could  make a difference to the constituents whom I represent, and to the constituents  of all Members. It is absurd that families with two incomes can no longer get  by comfortably, and I urge Gordon Brown to make it clear that the interests and  health of the people of the United    Kingdom are of the utmost importance. That  step is the first of many that must be taken. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I thank the Committee for bringing its first sponsored motion  before the House. The motion deals with a critical matter for the entire  community. Members&rsquo; contributions to the debate demonstrate just how  wide-ranging this issue is. We have heard about transport costs, the effects on  fishermen, rural enterprises and the agricultural industry, and, obviously,  those suffering from fuel poverty. A number of statistics have been provided  that illustrate how rising fuel prices have a disproportionate effect on those  with lower incomes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The increase in wholesale fuel costs are driving up the  costs of power generation and, therefore, the retail price of electricity to  consumers is also rising. Generation costs amount to over 50% of the final cost  of electricity, and around 60% of the final price of gas to consumers. Rising  energy costs are obviously of particular concern for the less well off, whether  they are pensioners, those on benefits or people on low incomes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The interdepartmental group on fuel poverty, which has been  mentioned during the debate &mdash; chaired by my Executive colleague Margaret  Ritchie &mdash; is charged with ensuring effective co-ordination of policies and  action to address fuel poverty. My Department is represented on that group,  which has been meeting representatives from other key Departments, and which  examines ways in which Departments can make a priority of addressing poverty,  income and health. I understand that the Minister for Social Development is  expecting to report to the Executive in the autumn with an action plan to  address fuel poverty.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the House will know, my Department has no direct role in  setting energy prices, but attempts, in co-operation with the Northern Ireland  Authority for Utility Regulation and the energy industry, to create market  conditions that will exert a downward pressure on prices. It is important to  recognise that we have our own regulator, and I am sure that the House will  acknowledge that that is important. We are fortunate to have such a regulator.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs McGill made a comment about regulation of the oil  industry, but I am sure that she will agree with me that, to have any effect,  regulation would have to be worldwide, and that is certainly not within the  power of a devolved region such as our own. However, that does not detract from  the work that the Department is doing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Throughout the years, the Department has supported several  initiatives. There has been much discussion during the debate about the  establishment of the single electricity market. That is a positive step  forward, upon which progress can be built. As Members are aware, the single  electricity market was introduced in November 2007. Although it will be some  time before people see the benefits of that in their bills, those benefits will  come eventually.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department has been involved in the mutualisation of  key energy assets, and lobbied for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s exemption from  the climate change levy until 2011. The Department was also able to offer a  grant to help to defray the cost to the industry of the energy efficiency levy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department continues to support Invest NI&rsquo;s delivery of  energy-efficiency programmes to industry. Those programmes provide valuable  support to industry and the wider business community. They are targeted at the  reduction of energy usage and, therefore, energy costs for business. Although  the Assembly is right to discuss the fuel poor in the House, it must also, as  several Members have reflected, support indigenous industries. That must be  kept in mind.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Invest NI has also funded the Carbon Trust programme, which  promotes more efficient energy use and uptake of renewable technologies. Since  2002, potential energy savings of some &pound;84 million have been identified, and  annually recurring savings of &pound;23&middot;9 million have been achieved in Northern Ireland.  Those are not insignificant sums.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland  also contributes to the UK&rsquo;s  member state energy-saving targets under the EU directive on energy end-use  efficiency and energy services, which is a natty little directive. DETI  currently works with energy suppliers to develop agreements to promote energy  efficiency, as required under that directive. That work continues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been much discussion about the Reconnect scheme.  Certainly, many people have lobbied their Members because they were not able to  avail of the scheme. Ultimately, not enough money was available to deal with  the applications that were before the Department. The scheme is currently being  evaluated. The Committee Chairperson said that he hoped that the evaluation  would happen quickly. I hope so too. A targeted programme to encourage the use  of renewable sources of energy must be examined. I hope that that will happen  in the near future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A co-ordinated energy policy that includes diversification  of energy supplies is important, not only to provide fuel choice, but for  security of supply. In recent years, power generation in Northern Ireland  has been provided by two gas-fired power stations and a coal-fired generator.  Since November 2007, the single electricity market has enhanced the security of  the electricity power supply for Northern Ireland consumers. The  natural gas network has been extended to 10 main urban areas outside greater Belfast. I accept  Members&rsquo; comments that the network is not wide enough throughout Northern Ireland.  Coming from County   Fermanagh, I certainly  agree. However, both business and domestic consumers in Northern Ireland,  albeit not enough of them, are being provided with a choice of energy supply.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Significant work is ongoing to establish how renewable energy  can contribute further to power generation in order to improve diversity and  security of supply and to help to shelter Northern Ireland from global oil  price fluctuations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland can become a leader in the use of renewable  energies. I believe that Mr Poots commented on wind power. Mr McFarland  discussed tidal energy. Tremendous, world-class engineering work has been  undertaken on the marine-current turbine in Strangford Lough. Much can be  learned from that work. I hope that other offshore areas can also become  involved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Cree mentioned that the UK  consultation should be used to place Northern Ireland at the heart of  renewable energy. I strongly welcome his comments. My Department is actively  involved with its UK counterpart on the renewable-energy consultation because  it believes that it can play a significant role, particularly on  renewable-energy schemes, such as the marine-current turbine project in  Strangford Lough, which are at the cutting edge of technology.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The electricity grid was mentioned, and, as Members will be  aware, a study was carried out towards the end of last year on how much the  grid could absorb because of higher levels of renewable electricity generation  and a movement away from the dependence on fossil fuels. There is some capacity  for doing that, but Members will also acknowledge the need to strengthen the  grid, which will have cost and environmental implications. Members commented on  the Planning Service&rsquo;s role, and work is under way on permitted developments.  Mr McLaughlin talked about micro-renewables. Under planning policy statement  18, the policy context is being developed for renewable energy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The increasing competition in energy supply markets  elsewhere has generally resulted in lower prices and higher levels of customer  service; however, Northern    Ireland is a small energy market, with only  790,000 electricity consumers. It is important to recognise that, because links  are needed, and the third part of the motion refers to that. North/South and  east-west links are needed; however, I would also like to see regional linkages  &mdash; perhaps as far as France.  That may be far in the future, but there are already links between the British  Isles and France,  and that could bring about the competition that does not yet exist.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Little can be done about the global pressures that affect  energy costs worldwide. However, I hear the call for a co-ordinated policy, and  I take into account the work that has been done in the Department since 2004.  This year, my Department will bring forward for consultation a revised  framework, which will reflect on the changing European   Union, United Kingdom  and Republic of Ireland policy context. It is important to  reflect on the changes &mdash; not least the global changes &mdash; from the point of view  of the British Isles and to produce a new  policy in that context.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure how much time I have left, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: You have 20 minutes in total.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: In that case I should slow down. I should be finished before my  time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will continue to speak about co-operation with other  Governments. My Department continues to co-operate on energy matters with the  Department for Business, Enterprise &amp; Regulatory Reform in London,  the other UK  regional Assemblies and Parliaments, particularly the Scottish Parliament and  the Irish Government. Evidence of that can be seen in the single electricity  market, which provides a single market for wholesale electricity. It combines  markets North and South into a much larger market, providing for economies of  scale. The benefits of that will be seen in future, but, as Mr Newton pointed  out, people want to see benefits now. It will take some time before the  benefits of the single electricity market are felt, but I will talk more about  immediate plans later.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am also considering common arrangements for natural gas  between Northern Ireland and  the Republic of Ireland. The aim of such a project would  be to harmonise gas transmission arrangements, particularly between North and  South to minimise transaction charges and reduce final gas prices for  consumers. The costs and benefits of any future arrangement are being  considered by regulators in both jurisdictions. A decision on whether to  progress the work further will be taken by the Department when the details of  the full economic assessment become available in the autumn of this year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is also in discussions with Scottish  Executive officials on the development of an offshore electricity grid, which  could absorb renewable energy such as wind and marine energy, which were mentioned  earlier.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am committed to working to advance regional co-operation  on energy matters with the British-Irish Council, which is keen to develop an  energy work stream. A strategic review is under way in the British-Irish  Council, and it will bring forward a proposed work programme in September 2008.  I hope that, for our benefit, energy is one of those work streams because Northern Ireland  has good news to tell, and I hope that we can be leaders in the field of  renewable energy. Energy infrastructure links, particularly through Scotland&rsquo;s  under-sea gas and electricity connectors, are strategically vital to us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since 2006, we have also had gas interconnection with the Republic of Ireland, and we are co-operating on  plans to build a second cross-border electricity interconnector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland  may be small; however, it has great connections with the Republic  of Ireland and the rest of the British  Isles, and there is potential to consider connections with other regions, such  as France.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members spoke about redirecting windfall VAT revenue  in order to mitigate fuel poverty. That is a reserved matter, to be determined  by the Chancellor of the Exchequer; however, I note that, on the 25 June, at the  Joint Ministerial Committee meeting, my colleagues the First Minister and the  deputy First Minister raised the matter of escalating fuel costs with the Prime  Minister. My colleague the First Minister said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The deputy First Minister and I recently raised the  issue of rising fuel prices and the impact they are having here directly with  the Prime Minister.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Therefore, that matter has been raised at the  highest level.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the Minister for Social Development confirmed  that she and the fuel poverty task force will lobby the Chancellor of the  Exchequer to increase the winter fuel payment. A comment was made that it is  not rising at the desired rate. Furthermore, the Minister for Social  Development will make representations about VAT.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, Mr Cree and Mr Hamilton pointed out that, although  the Treasury will benefit from higher-than-planned receipts from fuel-related  VAT, it will face shortfalls in other VAT and indirect tax receipts as  consumers rein in their spending. The level of stamp-duty receipts will also  deteriorate as the housing market contracts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland has little scope to be sheltered  from the significant rise in global energy costs. We recently moved to a new  energy-cost platform, with impacts on domestic and business consumers  throughout Northern Ireland,  and, although we will do what we can within our limits to alleviate that, the  House is fully aware of the impact of such increases and will wish to ensure  that there is no negative impact on industry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I fully support my Department&rsquo;s input to the  interdepartmental group on fuel poverty, which is considering how best to  alleviate the burden of rising energy costs on the most vulnerable in society,  and I am keen to identify the best energy solutions for Northern Ireland to  enhance security of supply, reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels,  help reduce our carbon footprint and, importantly, minimise consumer costs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said when I spoke about industry versus households,  that is not an easy balancing act, and concerted efforts with key stakeholders  &mdash; especially the Utility Regulator &mdash; will be necessary, particularly to  minimise the effects of rising energy prices on the most vulnerable. That will  require the engagement of all Northern Ireland Departments and their Ministers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members commented about social tariffs, and, we must  discuss such matters with the utility regulator to gauge their impact on Northern Ireland  industry and society. Frankly, there is not much point in giving a social  tariff to people with low incomes if we then put those people out of jobs by  penalising industry in Northern    Ireland. Those are the sort of matters that  we must discuss with the regulator, and we stand ready to do so. Furthermore, I  can assure the House about my Department&rsquo;s willingness to play its part in  attempts to alleviate the burden faced by the fuel poor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The debate was informative, and  many Members contributed. Therefore, if I fail to mention anything, it will be  because I have not been able to write everything down. The fact that so many  Members wished to speak &mdash; and that all Members who did spoke in favour of the  motion &mdash; is good.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Having proposed the motion, the Chairman of the Committee  for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Mark Durkan, highlighted the real  problems facing an ever-increasing number of businesses and people in our  communities. He emphasised the timeliness of the debate, given the recent news  that energy-industry insiders are predicting even further price rises this year  of up to 40%, which could plunge an extra 1&middot;6 million people into fuel poverty.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Robin Newton warned that oil prices have not yet peaked.  Like other Members, he highlighted the fact that consumers are facing higher  energy bills but that wages are not increasing to reflect those higher costs&mdash;  rather they are staying the same.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alan McFarland said that we must understand energy-market  speculation, particularly the role of banks; we heard that oil, for instance,  is being traded 12 times before it reaches the consumer. People should not try  to make money from those who face financial difficulties. Speculators are in  danger of wrecking the whole economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some members of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment recently visited credit unions in the Waterside in Derry. The staff  there said that oil has become so expensive that some people are applying for  loans to fill up their tank at home, which is worrying. Some people say that  households need to switch on their heating in summer; whether or not people  switch on their heating now, come autumn the crisis will worsen. Members agree  that we must take action now. Longer-term measures must be put in place, but  something must be done in the short term as well.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As several Members said, there is substantial evidence of  the effects of rising energy prices. Jim Shannon defined fuel poverty as being  when people have to spend more than 10% of their household income on fuel; many  people have already reached that point. Simon Hamilton described the evidence  as sobering; he pointed out that even in Strangford, which many might describe  as an affluent area, some 7,000 households are living in fuel poverty. We are  most concerned about elderly, disabled and disadvantaged people, but many  families are finding it difficult to make ends meet, even when two family  members are working. Thus the rise in fuel costs affects everybody.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Leslie Cree said that stark choices will have to be made by  hardworking consumers and businesses in the months ahead. The prediction was  that at the end of 2008, household bills will have increased by 61%. We again  heard the slogan, &ldquo;Eat or heat&rdquo;, and that will be the choice for many people in  the months to come.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alasdair McDonnell warned that people will die if there is  a hard winter. That is a great concern, particularly for the elderly. All the  members of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment welcomed the warm  homes schemes, and Sean Neeson noted that it had made a major contribution to  greater energy efficiency. Many Members mentioned the need to make homes more  energy-efficient. Those efforts cannot be made in isolation; a package of  measures is needed. We must encourage people to think about how they can use  energy more efficiently. George Robinson said that leaving lights on in rooms when  they are not being used can add to fuel bills.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mitchel McLaughlin quoted some interesting figures from  Environment Link, which claims that 80% of the energy consumption in buildings  is for heating, generally oil heating. He highlighted the important role that  building regulations and planning policy play in encouraging energy efficiency.  Leslie Cree said that the typical household uses five times more energy than it  should and that greater energy efficiency could reduce household bills by  almost a fifth.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee Chairperson and others highlighted the  complexity of energy issues. Sean Neeson noted that those issues have rightly  dominated the Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee&rsquo;s proceedings. Several  Members called for a co-ordinated energy strategy. As Sean Neeson said, much of  the evidence to the Committee has focused on the need to introduce a  co-ordinated policy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that several matters, including action  plans, would be presented to the Executive for their consideration in an effort  to adopt a more joined-up approach to energy issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">She mentioned the single electricity market and  acknowledged that although we encounter problems with regulation, the fact that  we have a regulator is positive. However, we must consider a more strategic  approach to the development of energy programmes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members supported the use of renewable sources,  such as wind and waves, to generate electricity. Claire McGill mentioned oil  companies&rsquo; profiteering, while disadvantaged people remain disadvantaged.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister outlined her concerns about the social tariff,  which have been mentioned in the House previously. However, we must work with  energy companies to develop that social-tariff system for the benefit of  industry and local consumers.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many contributors discussed renewable energy. Alan  McFarland and Robin Newton mentioned nuclear energy, and, although that debate  is in its infancy, it is a matter that is worth discussing. Some Members &mdash;  perhaps most &mdash; have difficulties with that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have tried to cover most of the points that were raised  during the debate, and I apologise if I have missed anything. The motion  outlines four proposals with a view to establishing a co-ordinated energy  policy. Short- and long-term measures are available. The Minister mentioned the  North/South and east-west connections and stated her desire to establish links  further afield in countries such as France. That is positive, and we must  consider extending those linkages. All Members called for a co-ordinated energy  policy. As the Minister said, we must construct a revised energy framework and  work together to reap the benefits.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to remember that this debate concerns real  people. As MLAs, we all bear responsibility. However, energy companies must  ensure that people can heat their homes and put food on their tables. No one  should be forced to choose between heating their home and buying food.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In low-income families who live in disadvantaged areas,  young children will, perhaps, go to school hungry in September, wake up in the  morning in a cold home or do their homework in the cold. They will not have the  same opportunities as children who do their homework in warm homes and,  therefore, this is a social issue. All Members outlined their concerns about  that matter. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes with concern, that rising energy  costs are hitting families in Northern Ireland harder than in the rest of the  UK; and calls on the Executive to:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">(i) give further priority to measures to promote energy  efficiency and combat fuel poverty;</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">(ii) drive a coordinated energy policy to diversify our  energy supplies, reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, increase competition in  our energy market and harness the full potential of renewable energy;</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">(iii) cooperate with other Governments, including through the  British Irish Council, to develop a longer-term strategy for these islands,  and;</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">(iv) urge the UK Government to re-direct the windfall VAT  revenue from higher energy bills to be used to mitigate the escalation of fuel  poverty in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="15"></a>Authority to Amend the Assembly Members&rsquo; Pension Scheme<br>
	        (Northern Ireland) 2000</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour for the  debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10  minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to speak will  have five minutes. Bearing in mind the subject matter of the motion, I expect  every Member who speaks during the debate to declare an interest.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly resolves that, in accordance with section  48 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, the Assembly Commission may make provision  for the payment of pensions, gratuities or allowances to, or in respect of, any  person who (a) has ceased to be a Member of the Assembly, or (b) has ceased to  hold such an office as is mentioned in section 47(3)(a) of the Northern Ireland  Act 1998 but continues to be a Member of the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I rise on behalf of the Assembly Commission to support the  motion, and I declare an interest as a member of the Assembly Members&rsquo; pension  scheme. Section 48 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 granted the Assembly the  power to make provision for the payment of pensions in respect of Members of  the Northern Ireland Assembly. Due to the suspension of the Assembly in 1999,  the draft Assembly Members&rsquo; Pensions Bill did not progress further than Second  Stage. Following a request by the then Speaker, Lord Alderdice, the Assembly  Members&rsquo; pension scheme was introduced by determination of the Secretary of  State on 13 November 2000, by virtue of powers granted to him under the Northern  Ireland Act 2000.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Finance Act 2004 and the Pensions Act 2004, effective  from 6 April 2006, have since transformed the tax and legal environment in  which pension schemes operate in the UK, necessitating changes to the scheme  rules. Those changes, which were deemed compulsory, have been applied to the  scheme by determination of the Secretary of State on 3 April 2006 and 2 March  2007.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the compulsory changes, the 2004 Acts have  simplified the tax regime, allowing schemes to introduce more flexibility for  their members. The trustees of the Assembly Members&rsquo; Pension Scheme (NI) 2000,  appointed by resolution of the Assembly under article B2 of the pension scheme  rules are responsible for administering the scheme and the fund. The trustees, in  consultation with their actuary, that is, the Government Actuary&rsquo;s Department,  considered the optional changes possible under the new tax regime and  recommended that the following amendments should be applied to the scheme in  relation to the following areas: earnings cap; retained benefits; scope for  commutation; trivial commutation; added years; voluntary early retirement; and  additional voluntary contributions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly Commission copied details of the proposed  amended scheme to all Members on 18 June 2008, together with a question and  answer brief, which provided further details on the proposed changes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">By adopting the motion today, Members will provide the  Assembly Commission with the necessary authority to amend the existing scheme,  taking on board the changes that I outlined earlier. That will also allow for  further changes in future years. I would expect that the Assembly Commission  would not make any further changes without consultation with Members in  advance.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Neeson to make his winding-up speech.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  The amendments will streamline the Assembly Members&rsquo; pension scheme and bring  it into line with other devolved institutions in Scotland and Wales.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Given that the motion for debate is the authority to amend the  Assembly Members&rsquo; Pension Scheme (NI) 2000, one would have expected the Chamber  to be full, but it is not. Therefore, no one can accuse this Assembly of being  self-interested.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Notice taken that 10 Members were not present.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">House counted, and there being fewer than 10 Members  present, the Speaker ordered the Division Bells to be rung.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Upon 10 Members being present &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Now that we have a quorum, I will put the question.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly resolves that, in accordance with section  48 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, the Assembly Commission may make provision  for the payment of pensions, gratuities or allowances to, or in respect of, any  person who (a) has ceased to be a Member of the Assembly, or (b) has ceased to  hold such an office as is mentioned in section 47(3)(a) of the Northern Ireland  Act 1998 but continues to be a Member of the Assembly.</p>
