                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I
                submitted an amendment to the motion. I have received no word
                from the Speaker’s Office of its being rejected, and I contend
                that it is perfectly in order. We are here for an important
                debate on agriculture. The motion before the House clearly
                states that the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
                should take a more proactive role in furthering the interests of
                the agriculture industry. I wanted to add certain things that
                the Department could do while taking a proactive role. The
                Speaker’s Office should have some respect for Back-Benchers.
                We should be told.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker, I was also amazed that you
                did not even know that the amendment had been rejected. We
                should at least have some procedure whereby the Speaker informs
                the appropriate people when he is not accepting an amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have plenty of time today, but we shall
                not be able to table an amendment that would highlight two or
                three issues that even the Ulster Farmers’ Union and other
                agriculture organisations have been raising.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You were kind enough to tell me your concerns
                about the amendment. I have made some enquiries in the past few
                seconds and found that the Speaker — as is within his powers
                — has chosen two amendments, but yours is not one of them. I
                do not know what the explanation for that is, but I hope that
                during the debate you will be able to make the points that you
                would have made in your amendment.</p>

                Standing Order does the Speaker refer?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly recognises the
                difficulties facing the agricultural industry and the importance
                of the agricultural sector to the Northern Ireland economy and
                asks that the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
                take a more proactive role in furthering the interests of the
                agricultural industry.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are meeting at a time of crisis. Although
                that is hardly an unusual statement in this place, the crisis to
                which I refer is not a political one. It is the crisis that has
                ravaged Northern Ireland agriculture over the past decade. The
                depth and seriousness of the depression in agriculture is
                sometimes hard to comprehend. It is almost biblical in
                proportion. The disaster seems almost endless: BSE, the pig
                crisis, bad weather and consequent bad harvests, the crash in
                farmgate prices and farm incomes, and the chronic debt levels in
                farming.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to emphasise from the outset that what
                I wish to say is meant to be constructive. Negativity,
                criticisms and blame-apportionment will not solve the crisis. We
                have had too much of that in this place already. It is time to
                put that behind us and behave as responsible people whose duty
                now must be to save one of Northern Ireland’s key industries.
                I tabled the motion on behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party to
                help chart a way forward that will help Northern Ireland’s
                agriculture industry not merely survive, but thrive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland farmers owe approximately
                £490 million to the banks. That figure does not even include
                what they owe to the animal feed manufacturers. Normally, that
                seemingly enormous level of debt would not be a problem, as it
                equals only 5% of the total capital asset value of Northern
                Ireland’s farms, which stands at £10·63 billion. Debt and
                debt servicing have become a problem because of the collapse of
                farm incomes. How can farmers service debts when they are losing
                money?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The figures speak for themselves. Of Northern
                Ireland farmers, 46% earn less than zero. Only 10% earn over
                £10,000 a year. Year after year, decline in farm incomes makes
                for depressing reading. In the past four years, they have fallen
                by 23%, 15%, 25% and 54% respectively. That means that farm
                income today stands at only 22% of its 1995 level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pig and poultry farmers lose an average of
                £20,100 a year. The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development estimates that not a single agriculture sector will
                break even in the present year — all will lose money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation is twice as bad here as in the
                rest of the United Kingdom because of last year’s chronic
                harvest. Farm incomes stand at slightly more than 20% of the
                1995 levels, whereas the UK figure is 40%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the Assembly express its
                sympathy to the farming industry. However, we must do much more
                than that. Assembly Members must act. They must be seen to act,
                and they must act now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Agriculture remains a key sector of Northern
                Ireland’s economy. Some 59,251 people are directly employed on
                farms. Another 19,490 work in food processing, 4,560 in animal
                feed and 1,100 in sales. The total number employed in the
                agrifood industry is 84,401. That compares to only 31,840 jobs
                in construction. Even manufacturing has only 20,000 more
                employees than agriculture. As a significant employer,
                agriculture must be the Assembly’s major and pressing concern.
                However, there have been more than 5,000 job losses in the
                sector in the past five years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two interrelated problems co-exist at the
                heart of the agriculture sector — drastically declining farm
                incomes and debt servicing. The scale of the problem calls for a
                major broad-based and sector-wide structural reform of the
                entire agriculture industry, and not merely piecemeal measures
                that tinker with minor details on the margins of the problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To begin with, it is a question of attitude.
                We must see a &quot;can-do&quot; attitude develop quickly, both
                in the Departments of State and in the Assembly. The whole point
                of devolution is empowerment. It is not good enough to poodle
                along with the failed policies of direct rule. A whole raft of
                proactive, imaginative and new policies are needed to make a
                real difference and to tackle one of the greatest economic
                crises to hit the Province. Making a difference is what the
                Assembly should be all about. I propose action, and action now.
                Agriculture needs what amounts to a new deal, just as that great
                President, Roosevelt, introduced a new deal to tackle America’s
                economic ills during the Great Depression. Therefore, we must
                develop new policies fit for this hour of crisis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have always believed that sensible people
                learn from the good practice of others. Existing methods for
                agriculture have been demonstrably ineffective. Now is the time
                for new initiatives. There is much that we can learn from our
                European partners. Structures exist in Denmark and France that,
                if implemented here, could go a long way towards alleviating and
                even resolving our present crisis. For example, Danish
                agricultural law, of which I have a copy here, could, in a new
                and imaginative way, resolve the problem of farmers’ assets
                being locked up in land, farm stock and buildings. The release
                of those assets would perform two important functions. First, it
                would provide an exit strategy for older farmers who want to
                retire. Secondly, it would provide a mechanism for new entrants
                who seek a farming career.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Danish law stipulates that farmers do not
                simply pass their farms on to a son or a family member. Instead,
                the farm must be sold either to a son at 85% of the market value
                or to a stranger at the full market price if the son does not
                want to farm. That money then becomes a farmer’s retirement
                lump sum. It enables the farmer to retire with dignity after a
                lifetime of hard work. It can be used to service a retirement
                pension or be passed on to some of his children. By that method,
                the capital asset value, which is locked up and untouchable in
                our country unless the farmer sells up, is released. It ceases
                to be dead money and becomes economically active money. It is an
                imaginative and constructive way to ease up the movement of
                capital. Moreover, there are all sorts of spin-offs from it in
                the banking, insurance, pension and other service sectors, and
                it enables new blood to enter the farming sector, bringing with
                it new methods, new ideas and innovations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Denmark, the son or the buyer funds his
                purchase from three sources: establishment savings accounts,
                state guaranteed loans, and borrowing. There is a much better
                lending climate for farmers in the Danish banking system.
                Establishment savings accounts permit a new entrant to save up
                to almost £11,000 a year in order to establish himself as a
                farmer, with one third rated as tax-free. Beyond that, he can
                borrow a further 12% of the purchase price through a state
                guaranteed loan — typically up to £115,000. The key point is
                that that is a loan, not a grant. It must be repaid.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a loan, it does not infringe European
                Union Agenda 2000 competition regulations, as it does not
                constitute unfair competition or state aid. I have a copy of the
                regulations here, and they are quite specific that that is
                permitted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As part of the Agenda 2000 reforms,
                regulations governing agriculture have been greatly simplified
                into what EU Agriculture Commissioner, Franz Fischler, calls</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a simple and coherent framework.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aids for investment in farms are permitted up
                to 40% of eligible expenses, and up to 50% in less favoured
                areas. A raft of aids is also permitted in the 40% and 50%
                objective areas specifically to set up young farmers. Therefore
                the Danish scheme is perfectly within, and consistent with, the
                European guidelines, as one would expect it to be and, indeed,
                as it would have to be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Repayments by the farmer are subsidised in
                the first years — interest-free in the first four years, with
                a 75% reduction in the second four-year period, and thereafter
                on a gradually reducing sliding scale until the farmer has paid
                off the full amount. That is the equivalent of front-loading a
                mortgage, which is already a common financial device in this
                country. Such a loan structure would not be unknown to our
                banks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, there is no reason why that
                scheme, or a local form of it, could not be introduced in
                Northern Ireland. All we need is the will to implement it. I
                have had a copy the Danish agricultural law translated. We could
                use that legislative framework to draw up our own legislation,
                adapting it where necessary to reflect local circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The better lending climate in Danish banks is
                largely due to two factors. First, the banks have confidence
                that the Government know where they are going with a well-
                thought-out policy. Banking is about confidence. Secondly, the
                young farmer who applies for a loan comes armed with an
                impressive 10-year business plan, designed at his college of
                agriculture and written specifically for the farm that he wishes
                to buy. He also comes armed with a practically-based and
                business-orientated agriculture qualification — the so-called
                green certificate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Danish scheme is not unique on the
                continent. France has a similar scheme called young farmer
                installation loans. Again, there are low-interest rates in the
                first years of repayment, and the five big French banks
                underwrite the whole system.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. There are about four conversations
                going on. This is an important debate, and I strongly recommend
                that Members should have their conversations outside the
                Chamber.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In France, the loans are used to buy out all
                the inheritors who have an interest in the property. The
                borrowing limit is higher than it is in Denmark — as much as
                £150,000. However, the principle is the same — it is a loan
                and not a grant, and it is administered by the big banks and the
                financial institutions. That France and Denmark have similar
                schemes is more evidence that such schemes are widely accepted
                in the European Union.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Should the Assembly adopt a similar scheme,
                it would be opportune to open up negotiations at the earliest
                possible moment with our major banks and financial institutions
                in order to have them on board from the outset. The financial
                mechanisms would be better administered by private enterprise,
                or by a partnership that involves private enterprise and the
                Northern Ireland Executive, than by the creation of some clumsy
                state institution such as a land bank. We do not want to create
                any more &quot;big government&quot; or yet another quango.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To reduce interest rate repayments,
                especially in the early years of repayment, and to extend the
                duration of loans to periods more consistent with the working
                lives of farmers — typically, 20 years, roughly the same as
                for the average house mortgage — are simple fiscal mechanisms
                that would ease the cash-flow problems of many farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If rescheduling of debt is to be the World
                Bank’s recommended course of action for Third-World countries,
                surely the same measure of tolerance needs to be extended to our
                own agriculture sector, even for reasons of self- interest. We
                cannot afford to permit the agriculture sector to crash. If we
                do, the knock-on effect on other sectors will be enormous. It
                will have a serious impact on the service sector of the economy.
                Many jobs in the service sector rely on the agriculture and
                manufacturing sectors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The mechanisms and changes that I propose
                would have profound consequences for restructuring the farming
                sector. I have tried to outline the ways forward, and to flesh
                out those plans with some detail and worked examples. If adopted
                in broad principle by the Assembly, the proposals would need to
                be worked out in operational detail in a constructive and
                co-operative way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the ongoing talks with the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. By putting
                agriculture on a new footing, we can help to lift that critical
                sector of the economy out of deepening recession and into
                profitability and a well grounded success.</p>

                minutes for each Member who wishes to speak, 30 minutes for the

                speech.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Agriculture and Rural
                Development Committee (Rev&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Ian&nbsp;Paisley):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that none of the amendments tabled
                by Back-Benchers were accepted by the Speaker. I shall take up
                that matter with him. The debate is limited in time, and it
                would have been good to have extra time for those Members who
                wished to table amendments. That would not have diminished the
                motion but strengthened it. I agree with Mr Savage. His
                proposals need to be considered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our farmers need to be defended against
                Europe. Too often, Ministers, the Department and others say that
                they can do nothing because Europe does not allow it. However,
                ‘Environmental Regulations and Farmers’, a document
                published by a quango — the Better Regulation Task Force —
                set up by the British Government, makes it clear that a stand
                must be taken against Europe. One of its proposals is that we
                need</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;to ensure that European Commission (EC)
                directives properly reflect the interests of British farmers and
                are practical and enforceable.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That body has discovered that agriculture
                Directives do not express the best interests of farmers in the
                United Kingdom, especially in Northern Ireland. The task force
                also recommends that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;as a general rule, the UK should not
                implement EC directives ahead of other Member States.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister assure us that none of
                those orders from Europe will be implemented here until they are
                implemented in the other member states of the EU? Why should we
                hang ourselves with a rope manufactured by the French and
                Germans, and why should we hang the farming community? If the
                Minister wants to be proactive, she should take a firm stand
                along the lines of that document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister needs to face up to the terrible
                threat that will develop as BSE spreads on the continent. Some
                time ago, I said that the continent would get what we were
                passing through, but people laughed. All the signs are that BSE
                will be a threat throughout Europe. Meat from countries in the
                European Union whose beef is not up to the standards of the beef
                produced by our farmers must be banned from our country. Why
                should meat that does not meet the standards demanded of our
                farmers come into the country? The Minister should take a firm
                stand on that. France is already violating the law on that
                matter. However, I do not want anyone to misrepresent what I
                say: I am not saying that we should ban all meat from the
                continent, merely that we should ban all meat that is not up to
                the standards that our farmers have to meet. That is reasonable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the banning of meat-and-bone meal.
                At the last session of the European Parliament, there was great
                opposition to that ban, and it has been introduced only because
                European countries have been forced to agree to it by the spread
                of BSE. I remember when the European Parliament wanted us to
                kill off as many cattle as we could, but this time I did not
                hear a single Member from any European country talking about
                slaughtering cattle. It seems that there are different rules for
                the farming community in the United&nbsp;Kingdom, which includes
                the farmers in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also need a farm restructuring scheme. I
                hope that the Minister will spend a few minutes on the crisis in
                the pig industry during her allocated 30 minutes. The money that
                has been offered to farmers who have left the pig industry is
                not substantial — £200 for a sow is by no means adequate
                compensation and will not help farmers much. However, I suppose
                that it is something, and we must welcome it. None the less, at
                present, we have only a promise from the United&nbsp;Kingdom
                Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, on which he has not
                yet delivered. He has not delivered on his second promise to
                those who are still involved in the pig industry. We should be
                clear about those two situations. There must be a farm
                restructuring scheme. We must encourage new entrants into
                farming or the industry will perish, and there must be
                compensation for those currently involved in farming who want to
                get out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the material on the Danish scheme;
                such schemes should be carefully studied. I would also like the
                Minister to comment on the report that was submitted to the
                Strasbourg Parliament last month. The introduction of a single
                enhanced environment scheme is essential. The Minister and the
                Department should be proactive about that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, although I regret that
                the amendments to it were not permitted. I do not believe that
                the mover would have opposed them.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I first saw the motion I was tempted to
                table an amendment to include words such as &quot;inherit&quot;.
                I also wondered about the use of the word &quot;more&quot;.
                Having said that, I support the motion in principle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a reminder — and Mr Savage used the
                word repeatedly — of the crisis that agriculture was and is
                still in. It is the same crisis that first surfaced in the
                mid-1990s. It was the responsibility of other Ministers then,
                but we have now inherited that responsibility.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In fairness to everyone, when we got the
                Assembly up and running, that nightmare was taken on board
                immediately. When recovery looked almost impossible — and
                perhaps to some it still does — the different groupings rolled
                up their sleeves and took it seriously. We adopted a proactive
                approach. I refer to both the Minister’s and the Department’s
                proactive role to date, as well as to the Agriculture Committee.
                There has also been support from external bodies such as the
                Ulster Farmers’ Union and the Northern Ireland Agricultural
                Producers’ Association. Everyone who wanted the Assembly to
                get up and running made genuine efforts to take an in-depth look
                at where we were.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP recently held its conference in
                Newcastle, where there was an item on the agenda on a proactive
                agriculture programme. I am not giving away any party secrets
                when I say that the item was placed on the agenda by none other
                than the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development. It was
                her thinking and her intentions that brought about that
                proactive programme. The word &quot;proactive&quot; is not
                completely new, but it recognises that the situation still has
                to be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Agriculture is our largest industry, and it
                must be saved for a multitude of reasons. A proactive role is
                the only way forward. It is not simply a Northern Ireland
                problem, but, as the Chairperson of the Agriculture and Rural
                Development Committee said, it is also a European problem,
                although those countries deal with it in different ways, and
                some do not deal with it at all. Who should deal with it? Again,
                I suppose we have to start with the Minister and officials from
                the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and the
                Agricultural and Rural Development Committee. Other Ministers
                could slot in to assist the industry, such as the Minister of
                the Environment, Mr Foster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many farmers would benefit from having their
                building sites approved for sale, as they can fetch around
                £40,000 to £45,000 if they are in the right location. That
                money could prove a lifeline to many farmers; it could save
                their farms. The problem is that those sites are often in an
                environmentally sensitive area or in an area of outstanding
                natural beauty. Those are beautiful environmental titles, but
                they still prevent farmers from selling the sites. Some
                consideration should be given to that matter, and Mr Foster did
                express a degree of sympathy with my views. He recognised that
                the lifeline to which I refer could be given to some farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Departments such as the Department of
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment could also help, as could the
                Department for Regional Development. Rural proofing is inbuilt
                in all Departments now, which most Members welcome. We could
                perhaps expand on rural proofing and make it even more
                rural-conscious, with each Department being more proactive in
                rural matters to assist the economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nick Brown and his team in Westminster have a
                role to play. I often wonder whether they know where Northern
                Ireland is and how seriously they take the Northern Ireland
                issue. However, recently we have been led to believe that they
                are taking the matter seriously, and we can challenge that. The
                Council of Ministers in Europe also has a role to play. Last,
                but by no means least, the farmers themselves have a proactive
                role to play.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the Committee’s in-depth research
                into debt and all aspects of the crisis, millions of words were
                said and recorded, and some stick out in my memory —
                &quot;quality produce&quot;, &quot;good husbandry&quot; and
                &quot;selective breeding&quot;. Those fit into the proactive
                role that everyone will have to play. I make no apology for
                including the farmer. The surviving farmer is the willing
                farmer, the farmer who is willing to adopt a proactive role.
                Farmers are still crying out for help, and they have expressed
                their willingness to join us to promote and save the industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                First, I would like to say that seven minutes is not long enough
                to deliver the speech that I had in mind, but I will make an
                attempt. I support this very timely motion, particularly as it
                comes in a week in which we face the onslaught of BSE
                repercussions from mainland Europe due to the situation that it
                now finds itself in. There are a number of reasons why farmers
                find themselves in this debt situation — BSE, market failure,
                and the state of sterling and the euro are all part of it. Some
                people would not like to admit that there is market failure, but
                there has to be a quality product before there will be a market.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People in shops and supermarkets up and down
                the country are in the business of selling quality food because
                they know they have a ready market week on week. Farmers are not
                in that position, and have not been for years. That started, as
                far as we are concerned, because the British Government were
                never prepared to take responsibility for their part in the BSE
                situation and the fact that meat-and-bone meal was allowed to be
                put into cattle food without being properly processed. They
                should have taken responsibility for that, but they did not.
                Neither did they compensate farmers accordingly. Since then, our
                markets have been lost, and farmers have had to suffer the
                effects of the European ban and increased costs as a result of
                regulations. We have been anchored to the very high incidence of
                BSE in the main part of England, leaving out Scotland and part
                of Wales. The Government have anchored us with them for a very
                long time. We could have gone into new markets long ago if it
                had not been for the British insisting that we stay part of the
                so-called GB. In this area we have, and always have had, a very
                low incidence of BSE, and we should have entered those markets
                long ago. We are now locked in yet again, probably for several
                years, as a result of the difficulties emanating from Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The British Government and ourselves have to
                look to the future, for there will be a future after BSE. We
                should be saying that there is a future for farmers if they have
                quality produce and if they tap those markets in years to come.
                We need to work towards that, but our Programme for Government
                does not prepare us for that. There is nothing there to bring
                new people into the industry or let people leave it in a
                dignified way. Payments will be made to those in marketing and
                those who want to leave farming, but there is nothing to
                encourage people into the industry, which is wrong. That has to
                be addressed — if not now, in future years. There should be
                some type of retirement scheme — tailored, perhaps, so that it
                is not as expensive as the Minister mentioned. It should be
                tailored to suit our needs. That would be a proactive move. We
                also need an environmental scheme, for which the farm
                organisations have pushed strongly, and I believe that that can
                be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have witnessed £15 million being taken
                away with the Sub-Programme for Agriculture and Rural
                Development (SPARD) scheme, under which, as farmers know, grants
                were paid out during the last few years. That was taken away,
                but we were never told where it went. If we look at other areas,
                such as the South and France, and their commitment to the
                farmers and to what they see as farming in the future, we see
                that they all expect to have a food farming industry in years to
                come. That does not seem to be coming across from our
                Governments; they point to training as being the way out.
                However, that would encourage people to move away from farming
                altogether and away from the countryside, which is not what we
                are trying to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the payment system here,
                farmers need localised payments to be paid out properly and on
                time. That is not happening. The Minister told us yesterday that
                180 complaints was a very small number, but if all the
                complaints that go to the farm organisations were to go to the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development daily, staff
                there would get very little work done. What is the format for
                payments to farmers in relation to the suckler cow payments? Is
                someone who submitted an application form in October being paid
                before a person who submitted a form in July? That seems to be
                the case at the moment. Those are small issues, but they are
                important to local farmers.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not propose to list a detailed catalogue
                of the existing problems in the agriculture industry. If we did
                not know them already, the mover has set them down in the
                motion. However, I would like to add my voice to the comments
                made by Dr Paisley. The motion, although acceptable, is much
                weaker than it might have been. It could have been considerably
                improved by amendment. An amendment to the motion would have
                beefed it up and added more detail to it. My amendment would
                have been slightly better than Dr Paisley’s, but that is the
                way the world goes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to highlight some specific areas
                in which the Minister needs to act in the near future.
                Undoubtedly, deep within the bowels of Dundonald House, her
                officials are looking into the issues raised by the Better
                Regulation Task Force — the Haskins report, in other words —
                which principally applied to England but which clearly has
                lessons for the whole of the UK. I ask the Minister, in her
                response, to tell us where Northern Ireland stands in regards to
                Lord Haskins’s recommendations and how she proposes to deal
                with them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first and most obvious problem, which Dr
                Paisley has already highlighted, is that the Haskins report has
                left no room for doubt that EU Directives, when applied in the
                UK, are being gold-plated. I have no problem with the concept of
                seeking to achieve the highest possible standards, but I want to
                see such standards being implemented across Europe. I do not
                simply wish to see British farmers producing top-quality goods
                while others get the markets because their produce is cheaper.
                That benefits neither farmers nor consumers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us ensure that the issue of gold-plating
                is taken on board and, insofar as the Department of Agriculture
                and Rural Development has a separate role from the Ministry of
                Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), let us ask the Minister
                to do something about it. A full impact assessment of the
                implementation of new regulations is needed. That has not
                happened in the past and if it is not done in the future it will
                continue to weaken our domestic industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of proper compensation for animal
                welfare measures needs to be addressed. We can make a case for
                saying that high standards of animal welfare are beneficial to
                the image of our industry and our consumers, but only if it
                means that people get the benefit of a higher standard of
                product. When supermarket chains import chickens from Thailand
                because they can get them for half a penny a kilo less than
                chickens produced to a higher standard at home, we clearly have
                a problem. We need to demand that it be dealt with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Haskins report highlighted a huge problem
                on the issue of record-keeping and bureaucracy, and there must
                be a way to address those issues. Again, it is part of the
                joined-up government issue that our Executive have talked so
                much about, but which is clearly not a feature of life across
                the UK in general. If we are to have joined-up government, let
                us see Government agencies, or even separate sectors within the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, start to share
                information and reduce the number of times that farmers must
                fill in the same form.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us make greater use of the Internet for
                the small but increasing number of farmers capable of using it
                in order to reduce their pen and paper exercises, which no one
                looks forward to after a long day working outside. If people can
                enter information on the computer once, and not have to enter it
                six times using pen and ink, that surely would be beneficial.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that even Dr Paisley would agree
                with me on one example of gold-plating. The standard UK
                integrated administration and control system (IACS) form
                requires 18 pages but the Irish form deals with the same
                information needed to satisfy the EU Directive in two pages. I
                am sure that we could all agree on that regardless of our party.
                I see that Dr Paisley is smiling and Mr McHugh is nodding, so
                perhaps we have established a consensus on that cross-border
                issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A secondary issue is that complaints need to
                be dealt with, as Mr McHugh highlighted yesterday and today. It
                is long past the time that a proper ombudsman scheme be set up
                so that the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
                would no longer act — as MAFF does — as judge and jury in
                its own cases. Whatever people say about the amount of formal
                complaints that get through, there is a huge level of
                dissatisfaction among farmers about the way that those issues
                are dealt with. In Scotland, there is already an ombudsman
                scheme in place. I could go through the detail of the three
                stages, but I suspect that, given the time that I have, I had
                better not attempt to do so. In Wales, there is an agreement in
                the new partnership Government, and consultation is taking place
                as to how exactly that will operate.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have the consultation document, although I
                shall not read the Welsh language version. The schemes mentioned
                in the Welsh document that could be considered by an ombudsman
                include arable area payments, beef special premiums, suckler cow
                premiums, extensification payments, sheep annual premiums and
                hill livestock compensatory allowances (HLCAs), as well as Tir
                Mynydd, the replacement for the HLCA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such matters must account for a huge
                proportion of dissatisfaction among farmers because of the
                extremely fine detail involved in our bureaucratic procedures.
                The people who must fill in the forms spend sleepless nights
                wondering whether they have completed them correctly. Some
                people risk losing large sums of grant money as a result of
                relatively minor mistakes in the paperwork. If Scotland and
                Wales can do something about bureaucracy, we should also do
                something.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that the Minister appears
                to have moved away from the bureaucratic opposition in the four
                UK Agriculture Departments and is considering a new entrant or
                restructuring scheme. Such a scheme would help to build a viable
                industry in Northern Ireland for future generations, who, at
                present, are reluctant to consider a farming career.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Minister said, it is not so long ago
                that, as a result of a vote in the Agriculture Committee of the
                National Assembly for Wales, Mr Carwyn Jones, the Minister for
                Rural Affairs, was forced to change his position and ask his
                officials to draw up a scheme. When the Minister submits her
                impartial report on the schemes she can be assured that the
                Agriculture and Rural Development Committee is likely to
                maintain its belief in the need for a retirement scheme that
                will lead to restructuring and give new entrants confidence
                about the future. We should try to encourage such confidence.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard about the problems faced by the
                agriculture industry in the Province, so I shall not address
                them at great length. However, I must draw the House’s
                attention to low — in some cases non-existent — incomes. The
                problems are due to many factors; we have no control over some
                of them, but we do have responsibility for others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of the factors that are beyond our control,
                the most important is the strength of sterling and the weakness
                of the euro. That affects export and import trade. Imported
                goods are produced in conditions that are not as regulated as
                ours and are not produced to the same high standards of welfare
                that apply to Northern Ireland produce. A prime example is the
                importation of meat from pigs that are housed in stalls, where
                they are tethered. That practice is outlawed in Northern
                Ireland, but our farmers are not compensated for that. The
                regulation and expense faced by our producers do not apply in
                neighbouring European countries. That is grossly unfair. The pig
                industry has been decimated, and farmers throughout the country
                are disappointed that the rescue scheme announced earlier this
                year has not yet appeared.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arable sector prices have been very poor in
                the past year. Despite that, the arable payments timetable has
                been put back another month. That is within the remit of
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, and should not
                have happened. In the beef sector, prices are constantly
                decreasing. There is still no low-incidence BSE status, which is
                imperative for the Northern Ireland beef industry. That matter
                must be pursued vigorously. We often hear that the problem with
                helping our producers is that any grants would be construed as
                state aid. However, such measures are within our remit and would
                not breach the regulations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We could reopen the enhancement section of
                our Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) scheme and ensure that
                enhancements are included when the countryside management scheme
                eventually opens. That would provide jobs and diversification
                for farmers and related industries. Many nurseries have produced
                quickthorns; local engineers can produce the gates; local
                builders can repair the buildings. All those measures would
                provide a boost for the farmers and the rural economy that would
                enhance the countryside and tourism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should also ensure that rural development
                measures are directed at farmers and that moneys taken through
                modulation are put back into farmers’ businesses. The money
                should be spent in the rural communities, which would support
                small industries and businesses. An expanded pollution control
                scheme, of which all farmers can avail themselves, is needed. At
                present, farmers do not have the finance to use such facilities,
                and struggle to survive. That would help the industry and would
                also cut pollution and enhance the environment. We must be
                proactive, not reactive — use the carrot, not the stick. Over
                the years, that method has been shown to work best.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although there has been discussion about a
                retirement scheme — and that may have its merits — I urge
                the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to
                investigate the possibility of helping young farmers at the
                other end of the chain. The Minister must investigate the
                systems of our European neighbours, many of which offer low-cost
                loans or interest relief schemes to young farmers who have
                agricultural qualifications and a good business plan. We
                recently missed the opportunity to offer a milk quota to the
                young farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must cut red tape in the Department and
                ensure that money goes directly to those who need it.
                Dr&nbsp;Paisley referred to a document from the Better
                Regulation Task Force, which was set up to make recommendations
                to the Government on how the environment can be protected
                without placing a burden on the farming community. I agree with
                many of its recommendations. The UK should not implement EC
                Directives ahead of other member states. The Ministry of
                Agriculture, Fisheries and Food should re-examine ways to
                compensate farmers — especially small farmers — for the
                additional costs imposed by certain UK welfare regulations. The
                UK Government should resist demands for further animal welfare
                regulations and should lobby to raise standards in other EU
                member states to match those that currently obtain in the UK.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley’s document also suggests an
                increase in the level of grants to improve slurry storage
                systems. That is important and would improve the environment. We
                need to ensure that information on grants and best practice in
                slurry disposal is effectively publicised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The demand for record-keeping by farmers
                should be reduced. The various statutory authorities should co-
                ordinate their visits to farms where possible, with a view to
                saving farmers’ time and money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
                Food should take on board those points and those of my
                Colleagues, as they are mostly items that can be administered by
                our own Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, and
                that can only impact for the good of agriculture in Northern
                Ireland. In the past, agriculture has been able to change with
                the times. Now is a time of change. Agriculture can change for
                the future, but that level of change must be such that we can
                reinvest and survive in rural areas.</p>

                points made by the Member. In fairness to the Speaker, I should
                point out that he had two people searching for the Member and
                myself to inform us of the situation. Efforts were made but they
                were not successful.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is our third debate on the agriculture
                industry’s problems. It seems to me that those problems have
                not been alleviated during all that time but have probably
                worsened.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problems are best summed up by a
                70-year-old farmer in my own constituency who thought that he
                had retired two years ago before realising that he would have to
                continue to work. He said to me that sheep used to keep him, but
                now he keeps sheep. That sums up the problems fairly well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At their core lies the policy of malign
                neglect by MAFF. That Ministry well knows that market forces
                will sort out the industry ruthlessly. That is what is happening
                at the moment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is shocking how Mr Nick Brown, the current
                Agriculture Minister, listens kindly and expresses great
                sympathy to the farmers but does not seem to ever address the
                root of the problem. The Ministry needs to start by spelling out
                the truth. I note that our own Minister has moved in that
                direction, and I commend her for that. When Ms Rodgers answered
                a question in the House yesterday she acknowledged difficulties
                that will affect businesses, dependent on production subsidies,
                as a result of European Union enlargement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to be aware that, whereas in England
                the tenant farming system has had the effect of stopping levels
                of agriculture debt getting too high because the farmer has no
                equity in the land to set against the debt, that is not the
                situation here. That needs to be taken into account when one is
                trying to negotiate packages that apply to the whole of the UK.
                We have to be aware that the problem is far worse in Northern
                Ireland than in England.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fully support and practise the eating of
                our own produce. I cannot understand why anyone would want to
                eat imported meat, but that is another matter. However, we
                cannot eat all our own produce. We need to get back into the
                export markets. Even if we could get over the problem of BSE and
                the export ban, the situation would still be difficult on price
                grounds because of the strength of sterling. That is entirely a
                matter of market forces; the Government cannot influence it,
                although they could soften the blow by pulling down some of the
                agrimonetary compensation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Realistically we are competing against other
                producers. In the case of beef, we compete against Australia and
                Argentina, and in the case of lamb we compete against New
                Zealand. Those countries manage to get their product to our
                market at a lower cost than we can.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">EU enlargement is relevant, although the
                situation has nothing to do with EU enlargement — it has to do
                with improved production by eastern European countries. Those
                countries are now in the same position as Australia, New Zealand
                and Argentina in that they can attempt to sell their product to
                our market provided that they meet the relevant criteria, which
                would not be difficult. Even if enlargement does not take place,
                if those countries improve their production, a further problem
                will arise with increased competition in the foodstuffs market.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must take all those factors into account,
                and it is likely that the effect of market forces will force a
                fall in production from our industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have some £160 million of production
                subsidies coming into our industry. The Minister should go to
                Brussels and point out that the problem is pretty much the same
                throughout Europe. She should say that subsidy should be
                redirected, as was attempted under parts of Agenda 2000. That
                has been started in a small way, but it should be much greater
                and more concerted in order to redirect subsidies towards
                lowering production. Money should also be spent on environmental
                improvement projects. By doing that, she would draw the rural
                development part of her brief into play.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall give a simple example. At the moment,
                the river system is, to a large extent, an industrial sewer for
                agricultural produce. The run-off from slurry, for example,
                contributes heavily to the contamination of the river system.
                Therefore, we do not have anything like the fish stocks that we
                could have, and we do not have that alternative source of
                activity in the countryside.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Denmark, the problem is dealt with by
                using a system of anaerobic digesters, which is effectively a
                method of industrialising the storage, reprocessing and
                recycling of slurry. The Danes are able to do that in a way
                that, first, is more efficient for the land and, secondly,
                causes almost no environmental damage — certainly much less
                than our own systems causes. Those more radical measures must be
                addressed. I am afraid that that involves the people in the
                industry and the Department all being much more brutally
                realistic about where the industry is going. It is clear to me
                that it is going to go in that direction, whether we do anything
                about it or not. Therefore, we had better move in the direction
                in which the market is moving. Mrs Thatcher once said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;You can’t buck the market.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That very much applies to the state of the
                agriculture industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An accurate parallel can be drawn with the
                textile industry. Northern Ireland found itself with an industry
                that had already moved out of the rest of the UK. The textile
                industry targeted by the IDB as a way to get investment into
                Northern Ireland and to preserve jobs. I do not criticise it in
                that respect. Where the IDB has got it right is that in the past
                two years it has effectively changed its policy. It has said
                that it is moving on and that the industrial base has to be
                moved more towards the new economy. It has not rushed in with
                more subsidies for problem areas in the textile industry.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I compliment Mr Savage for introducing the
                motion. It enables us, once again, to address the sequential
                problems faced by the farming industry and to seek a solution.
                The words &quot;more proactive&quot; should not be taken as
                criticism of the activities of the Minister of Agriculture and
                Rural Development and her Department. I do not think that that
                was the mover of the motion’s intention. However, if it was,
                the motion takes no account of initiatives such as the
                interdepartmental vision group set up by the Minister; the
                emphasis on the primacy of rural development and rural
                sustenance; and the detailed negotiations to try to get a
                breakthrough in the BSE crisis, vis-à-vis Northern Ireland and
                the European market. Last, but not least, there has been the
                huge and unparalleled 9·6% increase in the agriculture budget
                in this year’s Estimates — an increase regarded by the
                Ulster Farmers’ Union as a major breakthrough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not believe that criticism was intended
                in the motion, but the wording may have indicated a lack of
                activity. In fact, the proactivity has been remarkable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I forgot to mention that arable agrimonetary
                programme, to the tune of £700,000, has also been implemented.
                That again is very welcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the contributions to the debate have
                addressed the terrible problems that affect the farming
                industry. All sectors of the industry have suffered a sequence
                of almost deathly body blows. As other Members have said,
                problems include the strength of sterling, the weakening of
                international markets and the loss of some of our traditional
                markets, from which it will be difficult to recover.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is easy to examine the problems but
                difficult to suggest solutions. Each cost incurred in the food
                chain is another bite along the way, but farmers are not getting
                a fair wage from that price structure. We must adopt new
                mechanisms to ensure that the farmgate price is a greater
                proportion of the price we pay for produce across the counter. A
                farmer, like any other industrial worker or manufacturer, is
                entitled to a decent wage, and we must address this issue on
                that basis. That is particularly so, given that the cost of our
                electricity, fuel and transport is rapidly increasing because we
                are peripheral to the markets of north-western Europe and
                beyond.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Greater emphasis must be put on producing
                quality goods rather than on quantity. Some subsidy structures
                tend to support quantity rather than quality. However, in this
                day and age, it is quality that penetrates a market, not
                quality. The overemphasis on diversification as a panacea for
                farming ills is ill conceived and based on misplaced faith.
                Diversification can address a limited number of farmers’
                problems, but that is not a blanket solution to the problem in
                rural communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are now in a period of virtual trade war
                in Europe, with countries banning other countries’ beef amid
                fears of a further spread of BSE. It now appears that the United
                Kingdom is looking for a pan-European eradication programme in
                response to BSE. That will not increase the chances of success
                for our Minister and her Department as they try to penetrate the
                ban on account of our special circumstances. Our produce would
                have been quite marketable if only the crisis had not erupted
                once again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Minister said in her report yesterday,
                the application for the removal of the BSE ban is on short- term
                hold at the moment. She was criticised for that, but farmers’
                unions agree totally with the position that she has taken. They
                recognise that it is not the best time to make such an
                application and that, until the dust settles in this trade war,
                there is little point in trying to get a special deal for
                Northern Ireland’s beef.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Members touched on the matter of
                subsidy payments and the structures that would enable such
                payments to be made more rapidly and effectively than at
                present. The Minister dealt with that in response to a question,
                and I hope that that will resolve the problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the problems in farming, which if we
                put our hand on our hearts we will admit to, is the need for
                massive restructuring. Mr Savage, who moved the motion, and
                other Members have hinted at a possible means of restructuring.
                I fear that part of Mr Savage’s suggestion could give rise to
                a financiers’ and bankers’ paradise, but perhaps that could
                be restricted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farming incomes must be addressed as a matter
                of a social concern, separate from the question of farm
                production. We must treat farmers as the custodians of our
                countryside and give them the funding that they need to sustain
                our rural environment, not only for themselves but for us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am convinced of two particular
                requirements: the need to address the matter properly and the
                need for a structured social concern for the farmer, his family
                and the protection of the environment, which will give him a new
                source of income and support the countryside.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this debate, and I congratulate the
                Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural
                Development for moving the motion. I can identify with many of
                the comments that have been made across the Chamber by Members
                from a number of parties. The notable exception is Sinn Féin,
                which seems to be stuck in an all-Ireland time warp. That is not
                the answer to our problems. We need to get our heads out of that
                sandpit and look at our problems and at the practical measures
                that can be taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate comes at a crucial time. It is
                unfortunate that the Speaker took such a very narrow
                interpretation of Standing Order 15(3). A much fuller debate on
                the amendments that my party and the Alliance Party sought to
                put down would have been helpful. None the less, that is his
                ruling, and it will be raised in another place. Our party would
                have liked to amend the motion to give it more teeth because we
                must show the leadership that is required and give direction
                both to the industry and to the Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In spite of its best intentions, the
                Department will, by and large, ignore this debate. That is what
                Governments do. Governments listen to debates but essentially
                ignore them unless they are given firm direction and precise
                proposals, and in the absence of such precise proposals, which
                the amendments to the motion would have made, the Minister will
                be able to agree with many of the sentiments that are expressed
                in the Chamber while continuing with her Department’s
                policies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The policies that she has pursued have not
                resolved the crisis within the industry, and her Department has
                to be face up to that. That is not a personal criticism; it is a
                reality, and that is why this debate is helpful. The industry
                and the Department must pull up their socks so that the industry
                can move in a new direction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Department has difficulties in
                furthering the proposals, perhaps it is about time that the
                Agriculture and Rural Development Committee introduced a Bill to
                address those issues. I have already mentioned that to the
                Chairperson and the Deputy Chairperson. If the Department cannot
                or will not address them, we should introduce a Bill that
                contains the Members’ proposals on restructuring and other
                matters. We shall then see the colour of the Department’s
                money, and also the colour of party money. Will people put their
                money where their mouth is on those important matters?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Analysis is all well and good, and most
                commendable, but the industry in Northern Ireland requires a
                prescription. Because there is a crisis, we cannot allow the
                Department to continue with the policies that it has adopted.
                Everyone has said so. Even Members from the Minister’s party
                have accepted that there is a crisis. Therefore, we need a
                prescription, and it is essential that we prescribe in a helpful
                manner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party would like the Department to take
                three specific actions immediately. First, the import and sale
                of farm beef should be banned until our competitors are
                producing to the same rigorous standards as local producers. I
                noted that Mr Leslie enjoys eating Ulster produce and adheres
                strictly to an Ulster diet. I commend him and any other such
                discerning Member for that. I hope that Mount Charles ensures
                that it uses Ulster products in the Basement Restaurant, and I
                suggest that we ensure that our schools and colleges buy Ulster
                produce. That is essential to ensure that our produce be given
                every possible assistance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The introduction of a farm restructuring
                scheme is also essential, as is the introduction of a single
                enhanced environment scheme. Several Members have referred to
                the task force report on European regulation. It is critical
                that that form a significant part of Government thinking in
                Northern Ireland. Such measures, taken together, would give the
                industry hope for a brighter future, and we should make every
                effort to give the industry that hope.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All our past efforts to tackle BSE have been
                in vain. We could not have done more, but the BSE storm that now
                rages across Europe means that all the efforts we made to ensure
                that our produce was the safest and most scrutinised have been
                in vain because we shall not achieve low-incidence BSE status
                this year, and possibly not next year either.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Department has to look at other
                measures. To be masters of our farming destiny, we must take
                some control over shaping the industry in the next five to 10
                years. Only by embarking on a strategic farm restructuring
                scheme that will address farming debt, farm retirement, farm
                size, new entrants, production and strategy shall we become the
                masters. If we slavishly implement a regulation-based industry,
                the crisis will only deepen. I appeal to the Minister to address
                the problem and not the symptoms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We recently had a Budget that was hailed as a
                farmers’ Budget, but it gave a false impression. A figure of
                £6 million goes directly to in-house Department of Agriculture
                and Rural Development schemes, and £5&nbsp;million goes towards
                training, education and employment. An argument could be made
                that the Minister’s colleague, Dr Farren, should fork out some
                money for education and training if there is to be genuine
                cross- cutting by the Government. That way, more money could go
                into farming schemes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fishermen received absolutely nothing from
                the Budget. They have been sunk as a result of it. Their crisis
                continues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome what the Minister said yesterday
                about pig restructuring. However, will the Minister tell us
                about the small print, and what it will mean in pounds and pence
                for the farming community?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, much has been said about rural
                proofing. Although I welcome the concept of rural proofing, it
                is rather vague. I hope that the Minister will tell us about the
                &quot;whens&quot;, &quot;hows&quot; and &quot;whos&quot; of
                rural proofing. Perhaps we should move from rural proofing to
                farmer proofing, because that is the real issue. We wish to see
                rural development programmes that are farmer proof.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I support the motion and welcome the opportunity to debate it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie stated that this is the third time
                we have debated agriculture, yet agriculture continues to be in
                decline. There is an unprecedented flight from the land.
                Traditional farmers travel from rural areas to Belfast to do
                labouring work as bricklayers, plasterers and carpenters because
                they cannot survive on the land from which they used to be able
                to make a living. As Mr Leslie said, sheep used to keep them and
                now they keep sheep.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The decline in farming has been in the offing
                for a long time. The BSE crisis points to the problem of
                concentrating on beef production alone. It has left farmers in a
                very weak position. Whatever happens in future with BSE, a
                culture is growing among young people of not eating meat, and
                for as long as the threat and fear of BSE continues, that
                growing anti-beef culture will become more prevalent in the
                younger population.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ian Paisley Jnr is quite wrong when he says
                that farming does not have an all-Ireland dimension. I am making
                not a political point but the rational economic point that we
                live on one island and if we are looking for a market of five
                million people as opposed to one of one and a half million we
                must sell our produce to other parts of the island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is interesting that in the rest of Ireland
                one of the ways in which farmers have been able to earn an
                alternative income is by going into organic farming. In various
                areas in the west of Ireland FÁS has initiated schemes to
                enable farmers to learn about organic farming. Moreover, looking
                at the all-Ireland dimension, the rest of Ireland — the
                Free&nbsp;State or the Twenty-six Counties if one likes — at
                the last count was importing around £280&nbsp;million of
                foodstuffs per year from England, Scotland, Wales and mainland
                Europe. It imports produce such as carrots and parsnips from
                Holland and other parts of the continent, as well as potatoes
                from Cyprus and elsewhere. A previously untried opening exists
                for farming to diversify.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister should encourage farmers to find
                other means of generating income by using land that they do not
                traditionally use in this part of Ireland because of a
                dependence on beef production. The Minister should encourage
                that and give incentives to farmers to make better use of their
                land. Afforestation also needs to be looked at, especially on
                mountain farms. Grants are available, and those alternatives
                should be examined.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The planning issue arises again and again.
                Farmers are not trying to spot the landscape with unregulated
                dwellings. However, building houses is one way in which farmers
                can earn an income from land that is otherwise useless. House
                building can help farmers to survive on the land in the short
                term. The Minister should take up the issue with the Department
                of the Environment, look at in a structured way and, together
                with the Department of the Environment and the farmers, see
                where such planning applications could be granted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The farming community should be encouraged to
                look at tourism and be given incentives to become involved with
                it. Tourism is one area that has a future in this part of
                Ireland. One can get involved without spending a great deal of
                money, yet it can provide an income and bring people to this
                part of Ireland who have stayed away in the past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been a flight from the land. It is
                frightening in many ways to see those people who have no other
                way to earn an income, who are attached to the land, having to
                leave their farms to travel in the morning to places like
                Belfast, Lisburn and elsewhere to work on a building site. It is
                heart-rending in many ways for people to find themselves in that
                situation. I support the motion and I ask the Minister to be
                proactive in helping the farming community and the agriculture
                sector.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Armstrong:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this
                important subject. Agriculture is the backbone of Northern
                Ireland industry. It has been one of Northern Ireland’s
                principal industries for generations. Will Members stand idly by
                and allow our heritage to diminish? Our farming industry, and
                all that it represents, is slipping away from us through a lack
                of effort and financial support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report of the Better Regulation Task
                Force — ‘Environmental Regulations and Farmers’ —
                released on 15 November 2000, recognised the speed at which the
                United Kingdom Government implemented EU regulations compared
                with other EU countries. The United Kingdom Government has not
                been backward in coming forward to implement regulations at
                immense cost to our farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every sector in agriculture is in decline. I
                do not have to inform the Assembly of the facts and figures of
                each depressing commodity. We think of the pig farmers — those
                who have left the industry, and those who have struggled on. We
                think of the beef farmer and his harrowing life as a result of
                the ongoing BSE crisis. We think of the poultry farmer who finds
                it more difficult to squeeze out a profit and the dairy farmer
                who was treated undemocratically during the distribution of the
                additional milk quota. They all provide cause for concern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regrettably, we must realise that, at
                present, farming communities are heavily dependent on grant aid.
                Therefore, the Government must make payments on time to assist
                with cash flow difficulties and to minimise bank overdrafts and
                associated charges. They must apply for all agrifunding that may
                become available via the EU. Every effort must also be made to
                minimise the administration costs of agriculture grants and
                schemes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All too often, financial aids for the
                agriculture industry are only &quot;pain relievers&quot;. Real
                treatment is needed to improve the situation of Northern Ireland
                farmers. Measures are needed to put a real bottom in the
                agriculture industry. That would create a sound foundation for
                revival in the sector that would make the industry more
                profitable and provide a decent income for the farmer and his
                family.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government should engage in ongoing
                research instead of waiting for crisis situations, such as the
                present one, to arise. A vision group has been set up — I ask
                the Minister whether there is the need for such a group? Most
                farmers have a vision of the future. Why not ask them? Some
                people wonder what departmental officials have been doing while
                they have been using up any extra financial help received. Does
                the Minister have so little faith in the Agriculture and Rural
                Development Committee, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NIAPA and
                her departmental officials that a separate vision group is
                necessary? It is just more expense.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should encourage our young people to
                become more involved in the agriculture industry. That would
                create a more viable industry that would contribute to the
                economic well-being and culture of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In January, I proposed to the Minister the
                implementation of a farm regeneration scheme that would
                encourage young people into farming and agriculture and would
                take the elderly farmer into retirement. The young farmer and
                the father, or farm owner, would form a partnership for five
                years. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, and
                the EU, would fund the farm for the first few years. During that
                time, negotiations would begin for the farmer’s son or
                daughter to take over the farm with the help of low-interest
                loans from European banks. It would not be necessary to transfer
                the farm at its full market value. At the end of the take-over
                period, ownership would transfer to the young farmer. The older
                farmer would retire on the money that he received, and he could
                let the young person get on with the task of running the farm.
                If that scheme were implemented, we would have new generations
                of farmers for a new millennium, full of enthusiasm and new
                ideas for a brighter agriculture industry for Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, the reply that I received from
                the Minister supported my belief that the Department is negative
                when it comes to changing policies or pursuing new ideas for the
                betterment of Northern Ireland farmers. Departmental officials
                are unwilling to rock the boat. A vision group has been
                introduced that thinks along similar lines as those officials.
                Similarly, the Minister and the Department are not listening to
                the Agriculture Committee or farmers, nor are they introducing
                new ideas.</p>
                <i>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, but I cannot resist
                saying that it would have been nice if more Members had attended
                for the debate. I understand that they are involved in other
                important aspects of Assembly work, but I cannot help thinking
                that had the motion been on flags we would have had a packed
                House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the debate and wish to contribute
                positively to it, but at this stage it is clear to me that
                crisis management is not the answer to our problems. While
                recognising the need to support and maintain the industry in the
                short term, we need a long-term strategy to enable farmers and
                the industry as a whole to survive and thrive. We must enable
                farmers to manage those changes that are beyond our control and
                turn them to their advantage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Programme for Government clearly
                shows, local Ministers responding to local needs can make a
                difference — and are doing so. The commitment to the rural
                proofing of Government policies — already referred to several
                times — and to the setting up of an Executive working group to
                oversee its implementation are proof of the importance that the
                Executive place on maintaining a vibrant rural community. That
                should be welcomed by all in the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tackling inequality in our society has been,
                and must continue to be, a priority for the Assembly. I welcome
                the decision to allocate the additional milk quota progressively
                to those who would benefit most — the smaller farmers. No one
                can doubt the hardship farming families face. Therefore, I
                welcome any measure to improve the way that farmers relate to
                Government, especially the Minister’s decision to prepare a
                protocol, for publication during 2001, that will provide a
                comprehensive and clear explanation to farmers of how their
                subsidy claims will be handled. I also welcome yesterday’s
                announcement on the pig industry restructuring scheme and
                congratulate the Minister on her successful lobbying.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some things are beyond our control. For
                example, the Assembly cannot do anything about the strength of
                sterling except to highlight its impact on the agriculture
                industry. The United Kingdom opt-out from the euro is hitting
                our farmers harder than most. The SDLP has never believed in the
                opt-out, and today I call on the British Government to face down
                the Conservative Euro-sceptics and bring the United Kingdom into
                the euro as soon as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where we have the power to act, we should do
                our best, as I believe we are. The Assembly has a part to play
                in enabling change and supporting the industry through that
                change. We need to be responsible in our approach. The
                agriculture industry’s problems are our collective problems,
                so let us remember that it does not exist in isolation.
                Agriculture and rural development are integral parts of the
                rural community, and when we speak of agriculture we must speak
                of a holistic approach to the special needs of rural dwellers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Government Departments must develop joined-up
                government that involves planning, the environment, agriculture,
                rural tourism and all the support services that a rural
                community needs to survive. Rural dwellers in general must
                understand that the plight of the farmer is also their plight.
                Business people in rural towns know only too well, and to their
                cost, that when the agriculture industry is in trouble the
                entire rural economy is in crisis. Unfortunately, that is not
                always fully appreciated by everyone, and it must be understood.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I repeat that we have, for the first time,
                our own Agriculture Minister. She has shown a willingness to
                listen to farmers and understand the current crisis. She has
                gone to the ends of the earth to tell our story, and she
                deserves our support. Farmers expect us to sing from the same
                hymn sheet. They will not thank us for making their plight an
                excuse for political point-scoring. They expect us to approach
                their difficulties with maturity and responsibility, and I hope
                that we shall. There has been an indication in the Assembly this
                morning that we shall do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let the message go out from the Assembly that
                all parties are united in their determination to stand by the
                farming industry in its hour of need. Do not let this debate be
                a one-day wonder, with speeches written for the sound bites and
                then filed away to be dusted down later, perhaps at the time of
                an election.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let the work continue day and daily. That is
                how the Minister deals with the problem, and we can do no better
                than support her — not only in the interests of the farmers,
                but of everyone in rural communities. As I have said, the crisis
                is affecting everyone, not only the farmers.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this debate. The Assembly could not
                fail to recognise the difficulties facing agriculture, nor,
                indeed, its importance to the economy. However, the farmers
                wonder if the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
                has yet realised that. In the space of one year, there are 2,500
                fewer farmers, 7% fewer lamb producers and inestimably fewer pig
                producers. How do we begin to estimate the impact on the rural
                economy?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House must be mindful of the source of
                funding for rural development modulation. Many farmers must
                wonder when there is to be a return on the moneys taken from
                their premiums. Rural development policies now appear to have to
                satisfy the interests of more than the farmer. Rural
                development, once heralded as the second pillar of agriculture,
                is now perceived to have undergone a change of emphasis. Rural
                development and agriculture have to some extent diverged, with
                little overlap, and agriculture is the loser.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Changes in funding for agriculture seem to be
                limited to scant funding for some of the vision group’s
                recommendations. Other aspects of indirect funding for the
                industry, such as IT literacy, would be both welcome and
                valuable in a vibrant economic agricultural environment. To
                offer such training skills and technology upgrading, while
                disregarding the plight of the industry, is like issuing new
                lamps to miners after the pits have closed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to targeting social need (TSN),
                the state of farming throughout the length and breadth of this
                Province dictates that if that novel catchphrase is to mean
                anything, there must be an acceptance of the social and, more
                importantly, economic needs of the farming community. Are pig
                farmers no longer part of that society? It seems not, since they
                are still waiting for assistance. Are the beef and sheep farmers
                included less in the social make-up, since they seem to have
                been abandoned as prey to the processors? Are the dairy farmers,
                with their valueless Holstein bull calves, any less worthy of
                being targeted? How much in need must the farmer be for him to
                be targeted as being in need of the Department’s assistance?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is increasingly at play here is a
                Department with a singular role of implementing European
                policies, with no regard for the regional requirements of the
                industry that it is supposed to serve. The common agricultural
                policy (CAP) is supposed to be the bible of agriculture, its
                policies absolute. Given that, and disregarding the fact that
                agriculture may never recover as a consequence, can someone
                explain why we require a Department of Agriculture? If the
                Department’s function is to enforce EU policy without
                question, while the rest of Europe cherry- picks the rules, and
                our industry continues to crumble as a result, it is nothing
                more than an exercise in job creation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farmers are in no mood to accept a continued
                denial of their needs or of the burden of demands placed upon
                them as acceptable practice simply because some Eurocrat says
                so. I support the motion.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, I noticed that myself. If it goes to
                eight, I will not mind.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support my Colleague Mr&nbsp;Savage’s
                motion. I wish to emphasise the Ulster Unionist Party’s
                commitment to Northern Ireland’s farmers — a commitment that
                I am sure every party in the Assembly has. The scale and scope
                of the crisis — I use that word again — in agriculture
                require the sort of initiative and imaginative new measures to
                which Mr&nbsp;Savage referred.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as I am concerned, the most
                devastating statistic quoted was that 46% of Northern Ireland
                farmers have an income of less than zero. Nearly half of our
                farmers are not only earning nothing, but losing substantial
                amounts of money. Mr&nbsp;Savage said that debts are owed to the
                banks and to the feed suppliers, and Mr&nbsp;Douglas referred to
                the underlying causes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an important debate. Although I am
                not a farmer, I realise that people in the farming community
                will be watching us closely today. Mr&nbsp;Dallat is correct. We
                are not only talking about farmers; we are talking about the
                entire rural economy. When the farmers sneeze, the rural
                businesses catch a bad dose of flu. We do not know yet if we are
                prepared for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most recent statistical survey by the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development showed the
                obvious: farm incomes are at their lowest level for
                20&nbsp;years. The Assembly recognises that farmers are
                hard-working people, and it would be wrong for us not to address
                that state of affairs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No matter how sophisticated our economy
                becomes, and no matter how many high-tech industries are
                attracted to our shores, I cannot see any economy thriving that
                does not jealously protect its primary means of food production.
                Here, I am in agreement with Dr&nbsp;Paisley. It is time that
                the rest of Europe was forced to catch up with the animal health
                and welfare standards that exist in this part of the United
                Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Haskins report has highlighted the
                problems that need to be addressed. Mr&nbsp;Leslie mentioned the
                expansion of the EU and the increase of competition. It is fair
                that those countries that enter the EU should attain the same
                standards of animal health and welfare that we have. It was
                interesting to hear from Mr&nbsp;Savage that as many as 84,000
                are employed in the agrifood sector, much fewer than the number
                employed in the manufacturing sector.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To some extent, the true size of the agrifood
                sector has been disguised and obscured by the way in which
                official statistics are presented. In section 2, pages&nbsp;10
                and 11 of the document ‘Labour Market Bulletin’, issued by
                the Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and
                Employment, only four broad economic sectors are categorised:
                manufacturing, construction, services and other.
                &quot;Other&quot; is described as including agriculture,
                forestry, mining, quarrying, electricity, gas and water supply.
                However, &quot;other&quot;, which is deemed to include
                agriculture, covers only 20,750 jobs — a total of 3·3% of the
                workforce. That clearly cannot be the case if agriculture is
                included. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s
                figures are specific and, to my knowledge, accurate. Table 2.14
                on page&nbsp;19 of the latest Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development document, ‘Statistical Review of Northern
                Ireland Agriculture 1999’, shows that 59,251 people are
                employed on farms. Of those, 37,609 are full-time workers, 7,034
                are farmers’ wives — and nobody in the House should dare
                state that farmers’ wives do not work on farms — and 14,608
                are part-time or casual employees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The discrepancy between the total of 59,251
                in the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s
                figures — 9% of the workforce — and the total of fewer than
                20,750 in the Department of Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment figures cannot be explained by hiding
                the food production figures in the manufacturing total. Food
                production employs 19,490. In any case, it is known that
                59,000-plus are employed on farms, and that is supposed to be
                included in the Department of Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment’s figures. There is clearly a
                discrepancy, and I would like the two Ministers involved to sort
                it out, or at least explain it. Mr&nbsp;Ford referred to
                joined-up government — perhaps we could all use the same
                statistics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The method of gathering statistics may have
                much to do with remote and unaccountable Government under direct
                rule. We now have an opportunity to address the democratic
                deficit. As Mr&nbsp;Bradley said, the UK Government have much to
                answer for. At the very least, we should expect a uniform
                statistical base from which to work. I am worried that the
                gathering of Government statistics has, to some degree,
                disguised the extent of the agriculture problem and the relative
                importance of the agrifood sector in the economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Savage’s reference to a new deal
                for farmers is timely. The scale and imagination of his
                adaptation of Danish agriculture law and the French agriculture
                system to Northern Ireland’s situation is required. Perhaps
                the Minister would care to investigate that further with Mr
                Savage, the Ulster Unionist’s agriculture team and others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that there was no opportunity to put
                down amendments during the debate.</p>

                farmers, agriculture reform and the restructuring required to

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Again, as someone who represents a rural
                constituency, I am aware of the farming sector’s current
                plight, and I support Mr&nbsp;Savage’s motion. When I first
                read it, I was concerned that there might have been some
                implicit criticism of the Minister. It is fair to say that
                Minister&nbsp;Rodgers has given a strong lead while trying to
                represent farmers’ concerns and the problems that they
                currently face in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is true that this is the biggest crisis in
                farming since the 1930s. I have never heard of farming families
                experiencing so many economic difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a human tragedy that impacts on us all.
                Many provincial towns depend largely on the economic activity
                generated by farming and, as a result, are currently
                experiencing local recessions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland regional economy is more
                dependent on the agrisector than is any other UK region. In
                fact, until the BSE crisis, we consumed only 20% of our total
                beef production. We depend largely on an export market. I say to
                the Euro-sceptics that Northern Ireland agriculture has done
                extremely well out of the European Economic Community since
                1973. I remember when we joined in 1973. Dr Sicco Mansholt was
                the Agriculture Commissioner at the time. The farming community
                in Northern Ireland greatly benefited from the higher guaranteed
                prices that were on offer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, the volume production
                objective of the European Community’s agriculture policy
                probably created the current difficulties that we now
                experience. When we had high guaranteed prices, the objective of
                everyone in farming was to increase production and we reached a
                point where there was overproduction in the European Community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are now reassessing what the future
                objectives should be for agriculture, given that there is likely
                to be European Union expansion to the east, and also because of
                current food safety difficulties. Overproduction led to
                practices that did not enhance the image of beef production.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Agenda 2000 has offered a chance to
                reappraise the entire objectives of farming, and a greater
                balance must be struck between volume production and quality
                production. I totally agree with my Colleague, Mr&nbsp;McGrady.
                We must get into value-added quality production. We have nine
                meat plants in Northern Ireland, but we all remember when their
                output was simply what I call &quot;boxed beef&quot;. We were
                quite happy for them to export it to the rest of Europe and to
                the Middle East, because the meat processors enjoyed a massive
                export grant at that time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That no longer exists. However, Northern
                Ireland does have natural advantages in the production of beef
                and milk, and those need to be exploited in the future. That is
                why it is important that a long-term strategic review of our
                agriculture industry be conducted. The Minister is to be
                commended for setting up an agriculture vision group to examine
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with my Colleagues that short-term
                financial difficulties cause the greatest problem for our pig,
                sheep and beef farmers. We are all aware of pig producers who
                are selling pigs at less than what it cost to produce them. That
                is causing great financial hardship and a debt crisis in our
                farming communities. It is well documented that the Northern
                Ireland farming sector currently has debts of £500 million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister and her Department are limited
                in what they can do. We have been in a highly regulated market
                for a long time. We greatly enjoyed it when there were high
                guaranteed prices. We cannot really go along with a pure
                free-market system, because the free-market world prices are
                much less than, for example, the higher guaranteed prices that
                we currently get for milk. Our milk prices are about 25% less
                now than what they were four years ago, but at least the milk
                farmer is getting a cheque.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people whom I feel really sorry for are
                the pig and beef farmers, because they no longer receive a
                guaranteed price. They are suffering the reality of depressed
                markets. We thought that we were beginning to see some light at
                the end of the tunnel in relation to our BSE-free status, and
                the Minister was lobbying strongly for it. The crisis hitting
                continental Europe that Dr Paisley mentioned is now causing
                massive alarm and great difficulty, especially for our beef
                exporters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the Assembly address the
                crisis in a mature and sensible manner. I have not had as much
                representation on any other issue in the past two years than I
                have had from farming families on this one. Farmers’ wives
                have telephoned me late at night to tell me about their husbands’
                plights. In one case, a farmer’s wife told me that she was so
                worried about her husband that she feared for his life. I also
                know of a pig farmer in Castlederg who, 12 months ago, was
                experiencing a £2,000 a week loss in his pig production. He was
                so heavily involved that he could not get out. That is the
                difficulty faced by many people currently involved in farming.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one can overstate the seriousness of the
                situation faced by a vast portion of our population. Coming from
                a rural community and a farming background, I know much of the
                pain and the anguish that is suffered, not only by the farmers
                but by their families. Many of the farmers’ wives and children
                have been going through much of the pain along with the farming
                husband. Farming is in crisis. The rural community and rural
                economy is being affected by that crisis, and the shops in rural
                towns are being gravely hurt. The Assembly, and the Minister in
                particular, needs to look carefully at the situation and do
                something to alleviate the suffering.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members may read from carefully prepared
                scripts — some well, some badly — but reality is greater
                than any script. People are having to endure an intolerable
                burden, and it is wrong that they should be allowed to continue
                to do so. They get more into debt every day and with it comes
                hopelessness. The community is wondering what hope the Minister
                and the Assembly can give it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been meetings with countless
                delegations and a multiplicity of words spoken about the
                dilemma. However, it appears that the picture is getting darker
                and darker. Promises are made, but those neither pay the bills,
                nor settle the account with the bank.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Naturally, people look for a scapegoat. On
                many occasions I have heard departmental officials say
                &quot;Minister, you cannot&quot;. Will there ever come a day
                when an official can say &quot;Minister, you can&quot;? It
                appears that the Ministers &quot;cannot&quot; because Europe
                will not allow them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some members of the Minister of Agriculture
                and Rural Development’s party, the SDLP, have been great in
                their praise for the European Community. They should go down on
                to the farms; there is little to praise the European Community
                for there. Many of the regulations that are putting the farmers
                into debt — and almost into mental homes — are made by the
                European Community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It appears that the rest of Europe may drive
                a coach and horses through the regulations, yet they are
                considered the good Europeans. However, those in Britain are
                looked upon as the bad Europeans, yet they read the small print
                carefully.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Previous Ministers have said that if the rest
                of Europe does that, they will have to be penalised, but we
                shall not act illegally in the face of any legislation that
                comes from Europe.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meanwhile, we have farmers going bankrupt
                while the rest of Europe does not adhere to the regulations,
                which they are a party in making. Intolerable burdens are being
                placed on the farmer who does not have the money and who is
                being driven deeper into despair.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recently met with the Minister and the pig
                farmers. The question is: do pig farmers have a future? The
                Minister will say that she cannot answer that. I spoke to pig
                farmers a few nights ago. They were told by one of the leading
                processing groups that things will be great in the new year.
                They are dangling a carrot in front of farmers’ eyes and
                giving them hope that the tide will turn. The sad reality is
                that that processor may not even be in the Province in the new
                year. That is how we deal with situations in the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Europe was no friend to the beef farmer. I
                hope that the SDLP can tell us what a good friend Europe was to
                it, but let it be remembered that it was the European countries
                that tried to ride on the back of the BSE crisis in trying to
                take the markets away from the Ulster farmer. Yet the Ulster
                farmer’s beef was second to none. Europe was willing to use
                the pain and anguish that many farmers were going through.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard buzzwords such as
                &quot;diversify&quot; — diversify into what? Do we suggest
                that all farmers can be tourist-driven and that they all open up
                their houses as bed-and-breakfasts? It is so easy to say
                &quot;diversify&quot;, but the Department owes it to the
                community to tell people where, how, and into what they should
                diversify.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What hope has any young person who enters the
                farming industry? Young people have to attracted into the
                industry and retained, but there has to be a properly funded
                restructuring scheme. It is no good to use the buzzwords
                &quot;restructuring scheme&quot; — farmers need to know what
                that means, how it will be done, and how they will be paid. How
                will we get the elderly farmer to retire with a proper payment,
                and encourage young people into the industry? Those are the
                problems — the Assembly and the Minister must come up with the
                answers.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development’s role is not an easy one. Although I always try
                to ask her difficult questions to extract information from the
                Department, I recognise that there was a crisis in the industry
                when she took on the position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nonetheless, the Minister is responsible for
                leading the way. Her Department must come up with innovative and
                practical ways to help move farming away from the current
                crisis. More effort should be made to achieve profitable
                production, rather than administration. Will the Minister tell
                me, either today or at a later date, how many people currently
                work in the Department and how many worked there in 1995, before
                the agricultural crisis came about? That is a practical
                question, because the number of farmers has been significantly
                reduced in that period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current agriculture budget is £190
                million, yet farmers are taking home £22 per week on average.
                Why does it cost so much to administer agriculture when the
                industry makes so little profit? The £22 per week figure is
                inaccurate because those farmers who are in profit, mainly in
                the dairy industry, disguise the losses being made by those who
                have had to take jobs outside farming to keep the farm going.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister must look at the current
                regulations being applied to farming, which must be one of the
                most regulated industries in the United Kingdom. Certainly, the
                UK is more assiduous at applying the regulations than other
                European countries. That point has been well made today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to draw the Minister’s attention to
                a point made in the Better Regulation Task Force’s report.
                Supermarkets and Government Departments are both running quality
                assurance schemes, and there is a doubling-up of costs in that
                area. Farmers have to answer to the Livestock and Meat
                Commission (LMC) on one hand and to the supermarkets that buy
                their produce on the other. We should look at how best use could
                be made of those resources and how a scheme could be adopted
                that supermarkets would support. That should not only be a
                marketing mechanism for supermarkets, but it should reward the
                farmers for the quality of their produce.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report also recommends that we reduce
                record- keeping. That is interesting. For a number of years,
                there has been pressure to increase record-keeping. Much of that
                has been done in the name of BSE and of to achieve low-incidence
                BSE status. However, that has not been achieved, and the
                Minister has said that she will not attempt to achieve it in the
                immediate future. Not enough is being done to lift the BSE ban
                on Northern Ireland produce. We are a low-incidence country. We
                currently apply all the regulations that Europe is now thinking
                about applying. Northern Ireland produce is of the highest
                standard possible, and I believe that we have an irrefutable
                case to get the ban lifted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A new scheme is being introduced to test
                animals aged over 30 months to see whether they have BSE, and we
                should use that as further leverage to get ourselves back into
                the market by being allowed to slaughter animals over that age.
                That is a great hardship to farmers, as many of them have
                perfectly good beef animals. Those may not be ready when the
                time comes for them to be slaughtered, which means that the
                farmers lose a great deal of money. However, farmers sometimes
                find it hard to keep up with the dates, and they may let animals
                simply run out of time. A beast aged, for example, 29 months and
                30 days may be fine, yet two days later it could be deemed unfit
                for human consumption. That is nonsense, especially when there
                is a test that would clear the beast and decide whether it is
                fit for human consumption.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I submitted a written question to the
                Minister on the Sub-Programme for Agriculture and Rural
                Development (SPARD), and I thank her for her answer. We are
                often told that we cannot put money for farming into different
                schemes because of Europe. The Minister said in her letter that
                another SPARD scheme would not contravene European regulations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SPARD was discontinued in 1995, and farmers’
                places are beginning to become run down due to lack of money. A
                reintroduction of a SPARD or similar-type scheme — perhaps the
                emphasis could be on environmental and animal welfare issues —
                would help farmers maintain their properties in the proper way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department introduced planning
                regulations for people requiring farm labourers’ dwellings.
                Someone who required a farm labourers’ dwelling would need to
                have 250 cows to qualify. That is nonsense, and it needs to be
                looked at by the Department. That is not in the legislation; it
                is merely departmental policy, and I think the Minister could do
                something useful there. Will the Minister look at the basis for
                deciding the sheep annual premium and, if she can, along with
                other Ministers, help persuade the European Union to do it on a
                regional rather than a Europe-wide basis?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every farmer in the Province is eligible for
                TSN. The crisis has bitten everybody from the arable farmer in
                the east of the Province to the hill farmer in the Sperrins.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to support my Colleague’s comments.
                Farming is of paramount importance to the Province. I say so not
                because I represent the large rural area of Strangford but
                because each one of us who lives here depends on the farmer’s
                produce for the food that he or she eats. Whether we live in an
                urban or a rural part of the Province, we are all affected.
                Agriculture is the single biggest job creator in the Province’s.
                We recognise that fact, and, although there has been a downturn
                in the number of jobs, we hope that that will go the other way
                soon. However, that will happen only if the Government and the
                Department provide the correct level of support and are
                effective in doing their best for the farming economy. Many are
                asking — and this is a question that is on the lips of many
                farmers whom I speak to in my constituency — what strategy has
                the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development developed.
                Does it have a strategy to take agriculture out of the stormy
                waters that it is in and steer it into calmer ones? Farmers have
                been burdened with many regulations; they have heard many words,
                but they have nothing practical they can touch. That causes them
                concern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister recently announced that extra
                money had been allocated in the budget. Some have asked where
                that extra money will go. Will it go into administration? If it
                does, then the industry will have lost its way. It should go
                directly to the coalface — or to the &quot;farmface&quot;, in
                this case — to improve the agriculture industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every one of us can collate and record the
                downturn in the agriculture industry. In my constituency, the
                downturn has been significant and worrying. Many jobs have been
                lost, and some sectors of the rural economy have been almost
                decimated. There has been a radical change in the numbers
                involved in the poultry industry and the pig sector. Both have
                almost been wiped out. There is one pig farmer left in the
                entire Strangford constituency where there used to be 12 not all
                that long ago. One Member mentioned the number of pig farmers
                that have left the business. Once there were more than 2,000,
                whereas now there are just more than 900. If that does not tell
                the story of the pig industry, nothing will.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hen houses and poultry businesses across the
                Ards Peninsula and Ards town are lying empty today. Farmers were
                told, &quot;Get into the poultry industry. Your future will be
                made for you.&quot; But what has happened? They have lost a
                fortune. The poultry industry and the pig sector have seen
                considerable changes that have been particularly marked in my
                area. Other sectors have also witnessed changes: beef, sheep,
                vegetables and grain. Latterly, even the dairy sector is feeling
                the pinch.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ripples have touched the entire economy,
                and everyone is affected. Some shops have closed, while others
                are being run on a smaller scale — all because the farming
                community no longer has the spending power that it once had. One
                Member mentioned the products that we eat in the restaurants
                here. I put that question to the Assembly Commission, and Mount
                Charles Catering Ltd confirmed yesterday that it sources all its
                products from Northern Ireland and that 65% of the products we
                eat here come from Northern Ireland. That is a clear indication
                that we are setting an example, as is Mount Charles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to take planning issues on
                board. They are a big problem in my constituency and something I
                am involved in every other week. I would like to see relaxation
                in the planning rules and regulations, specifically for farmers’
                sons and daughters. I find it particularly frustrating that when
                they work a large number of man hours, which many of them do,
                that is not sufficient to warrant the building of a house. By
                setting the level so high, many people are left out of the
                equation. Moreover, there is no provision in the planning rules
                and regulations for those who may not be directly involved in
                farming but who have an alternative job; for example, in the
                Civil Service. I would like that to be taken on board as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are all aware of the need to restructure
                and modernise farming. However, that will be achieved only by
                the establishment of a meaningful and properly funded
                restructuring scheme. To achieve that, we need to attract young
                people to the industry, and we need to retain them. We also need
                an incentive — or a retirement package — for the older
                generation of farmers. The EU believes that those objectives can
                be delivered. It is unfortunate that the United Kingdom, on
                which we are focusing, and Holland are two of the few countries
                that have not adopted that incentive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also like to make a quick point about
                the protection and enhancement of the environment. That is a key
                concern for us all, but farmers have a significant role to play.
                Indeed, they have already played that role in that they are the
                custodians of the countryside. Some sort of capital grant
                element would help that sector. That would give farmers another
                way of trying to escape from their problems. A wider
                environmental scheme can deliver greater farmer participation,
                but it will require cross-departmental funding. Can the Minister
                tell us how that system will work? If those measures are
                pursued, the agriculture industry can, like a phoenix, rise from
                the ashes. The industry can create wealth for the community,
                which will restore confidence and provide hope for the future.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development (Ms Rodgers):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion calls on the Assembly to recognise
                the importance of the agriculture industry to Northern Ireland,
                and the difficulties that it has recently experienced and
                continues to face. We are all aware of the problems that have
                beset the industry. There was the onset of the BSE crisis in
                1996, followed by the appreciation of sterling against the ecu,
                and latterly the euro — a problem that was compounded by
                imbalances in the global market. The resurgence of the BSE
                crisis is another problem with which we shall have to deal. As
                yet, we do not know the full extent of the direct or indirect
                effects that it could have. Farmers in Northern Ireland have
                been powerless to influence any of those events, and the toll on
                farmers, their families and the rural community has been heavy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not, however, accept the suggestion that
                my Department or I have failed to take a proactive approach to
                furthering the industry’s interests. In a properly functioning
                and mature democracy, it is right and proper that the actions of
                a Minister, and those of his or her Department, be closely
                scrutinised by elected representatives. Ministers should be
                taken to task, if genuine failings are identified. However, no
                such failings have been identified in this debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have introduced several initiatives in the
                past year, and they illustrate how I am being proactive and
                making progress in delivering real benefits to Northern Ireland.
                I would also like to foster a better understanding of the role
                and aims of my Department. Soon after I took up my ministerial
                portfolio, I decided to establish a group of industry experts to
                examine the agrifood industry, identify the obstacles and
                opportunities that lay ahead, develop a vision for the
                development of the industry and make recommendations as to how
                that would be achieved. Mr Shannon spoke about the need for a
                strategy. That is precisely what the vision group that I set up
                was for — to provide me with a road map or strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Work is now at an advanced stage. The group
                will deliver its final report to me by the end of February 2001.
                However, the purpose of the exercise is not simply to provide me
                with a nice glossy report that I can display as evidence of my
                foresight or as justification of what I have already done. On
                the contrary, it will pave the way for an action plan that will
                move the industry forward on its own agenda — in close
                partnership with Government — towards the achievement of
                common goals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One Member suggested that the vision exercise
                was a costly one; it is not. The members of the group have given
                up their time voluntarily. The group is not designed to replace
                the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee or the Assembly.
                Its purpose is to provide me with additional advice from people
                in the industry who possess a wealth of experience and
                expertise. Given the recent upheavals and difficulties, the
                industry needs a lead as never before, and I am determined to
                ensure that it has it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another of my early initiatives was my
                decision to proceed with the case in favour of relaxing the
                export restrictions on Northern Ireland beef. I do not need to
                reiterate my commitment to that. At yesterday’s special
                Council of Ministers meetings in Brussels, a package of measures
                was agreed that will help the EU beef market. All member states
                must now control the consumption of beef from animals aged over
                30 months and stop the feeding of meat-and-bone meal to
                ruminants. The list of specified risk materials will be
                extended. As well as protecting the public at large, the
                measures will level out the playing field for the UK and other
                member states, and will help to preserve consumer confidence in
                EU beef. There will also be as yet unspecified measures taken to
                cushion beef producers against the financial impact. The Council
                also agreed possible concessions for very low-incidence
                countries, such as Finland, and the resumption of exports by
                Portugal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Needless to say, I shall watch those
                developments with interest, in case they read across to Northern
                Ireland. We are all well aware of the impact that the weakness
                of the euro has on farmers. That matter can only be dealt with
                via the mechanism of agrimoney compensation. In February I began
                a debate with other UK Agriculture Ministers that led to the
                March agriculture summit announcement of additional compensation
                that was worth more than £8 million to Northern Ireland
                livestock producers. I, again, pushed for compensation earlier
                this autumn, which led to the announcement of additional
                compensation for our arable producers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the support of Mr Leslie and Mr
                McGrady for my efforts in that respect, and I assure the House
                that I shall keep up the pressure for further compensation when
                it becomes available. Without such a proactive approach, acting
                in concert with Agriculture Ministers from other devolved
                Administrations, and with the full support of the unions, I very
                much doubt whether any such money would have been forthcoming.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, several Members have indicated that
                although those cash injections are absolutely vital to help the
                industry weather its current difficulties, we simply cannot
                build the future of our industry on emergency cash handouts —
                Mr Armstrong has termed them &quot;pain relievers&quot; — or
                by pursuing short-term initiatives that divert us from our true
                objectives and perhaps even create long-term damage for the sake
                of short-term expediency. I also recognise, as Mr Byrne pointed
                out, the existence of the short-term difficulties, and I have
                already referred to some of the actions that I have taken to
                tackle those difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An important example of how we lay the
                foundations for moving forward is provided by our recently
                approved rural development regulation plan, which is worth some
                £266 million between 2000 and 2006. If, as Mr Kane suggested, I
                had slavishly implemented EU policy with no regard for the local
                farming industries, the originally proposed less-favoured area (LFA)
                scheme would have been very different from the one with which we
                ended up. Together with other UK Ministers and Joe Walsh in the
                Republic, we succeeded in changing the EU Commission’s narrow
                approach to LFA support. I was also able to secure an additional
                £32 million over the next few years from the Treasury for that
                support programme, compared to February’s original proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rural development regulation plan
                contains more than just the LFA support scheme. The additional
                funding secured for the agrienvironment and forestry elements
                will also be welcomed by farmers and environmentalists. There
                are increasing market opportunities for organic produce, and I
                note that Mr John Kelly specifically mentioned that point. The
                significantly enhanced resources provided under the organic
                farming scheme will encourage the development of a vibrant
                organic sector in Northern Ireland and will enable local
                producers to exploit those opportunities. To underpin the
                development, I have commissioned a strategic study to identify
                the nature and scale of the opportunities open to the Northern
                Ireland organic sector. That will lead to a development plan to
                enable the Northern Ireland organic sector to realise its full
                potential.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Organic farming will also deliver
                environmental benefits, as will the expanded countryside
                management scheme, which aims to improve biodiversity, the water
                quality of rivers and lakes, and the management of landscape and
                heritage features. Those are important goals in their own right,
                but I am sure that the processing industry’s marketing people
                will not be slow to exploit the advantages.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another area in which we are planning for our
                future is represented by our proposals under the transitional
                Objective 1 and Peace II programmes. We seek to ensure that we
                derive maximum benefit from European funding and deliver a
                balanced package of measures, with benefits for agriculture,
                fisheries, forestry and tourism. Together, those measures will
                benefit the wider rural community, as was mentioned by several
                Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turning to measures that I have been pursuing
                with the resources available to me from the Northern Ireland
                block, the Agenda for Government, and the recently announced
                Budget proposals, I have been able to bid for additional funds
                to initiate several important and innovative programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development has been at the forefront in training farmers in
                information and computer technology (ICT), and its effective use
                in the farm business. I have secured funding to enable the
                Department, working in association with the industry, to develop
                a portal site specifically for farmers and growers. That will
                provide on-line access to information and learning packages that
                will assist farmers in running their businesses more efficiently
                and profitably.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a unique initiative to enhance farmer
                access to ICT facilities, open-access computers are being
                provided at sites across Northern Ireland, as agreed with
                farming representative bodies. We hope to have the first of
                those in operation early next year. I note that Mr Kane has
                criticised the initiative, but it would be unfair to deprive our
                farmers of access to the new technology that plays an
                increasingly important part in our lives. I welcome Mr Ford’s
                support for the initiative.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have also been able to secure substantial
                additional funds to help the beef sector tackle the reduction in
                carcass quality that has become an increasing problem in recent
                years. That problem has been recognised by several Members
                during the debate. Given that considerable investment, I shall
                consult the industry on how best to achieve the significant
                improvement that is necessary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agriculture industry has particular
                problems in controlling potential pollution arising from farm
                waste, and it has lobbied for a capital grant scheme to provide
                the investment necessary to tackle the problem. Some Members,
                including Dr Paisley, referred to a need for an environmental
                capital grant scheme. I was pleased to secure funding for a
                pilot farm-waste management scheme in the October Agenda for
                Government. That pilot scheme will target the catchment areas of
                those rivers and lakes with the greatest farming-related water
                quality problems. The scheme aims to reduce the incidence of
                farm-point sourced pollution, and to provide farmers with grant
                assistance for the repair of silos, slurry stores, and the
                separation of clean and dirty water. That is an important
                initiative, and if the pilot scheme proves successful I hope to
                secure additional funds to enable the programme to be extended
                to other catchment areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members raised the issues of the
                restructuring of the industry, early retirement and the
                encouragement of new entrants into the industry. Many Members
                will be aware that I recently commissioned research into the
                merits, both economic and social, of an early retirement scheme
                and a new entrants scheme. Particular reference was made to the
                experience of such schemes in other member states. Clearly such
                schemes have considerable resource implications. There are
                different opinions on their effectiveness and feasibility. The
                purpose of the research is to provide me with better information
                in order to make an informed decision on how to best use the
                money for the long-term benefit of the industry. I shall consult
                all stakeholders before taking any decision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Young people entering the industry must have
                the technical and business management skills to compete
                globally. They require the best of education and training,
                coupled with relevant practical experience. It is for that
                reason that the Department of Agriculture has for many years
                been at the forefront of innovative education and training
                provision, linked closely to the industry’s needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members spoke about the plight of pig
                farmers. I have already explained to the Assembly some of the
                steps that I have taken to help to improve, for example, carcass
                confirmation and marketing. I have also had meetings with the
                commercial interests and have encouraged people to source local
                produce.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have just heard alarming news about the
                funds for outgoers and ingoers in the pig industry that were to
                come to £66 million. Because the Treasury did not hand out £26
                million of that money, there is now an argument in the Treasury
                and in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as to
                whether the United Kingdom overall is to get not £66 million,
                but £40 million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister going to press — against
                the wishes of the Minister in England, but not against the
                wishes of the Agriculture Ministers in Scotland and Wales —
                that that money be regionalised so that she and the House will
                have an input into the way that it is spent?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Dr Paisley for that information. I
                cannot comment on something that is, as the Member says, hot off
                the press. I presume that it is still subject to negotiation,
                and I assure the Member that I, along with my officials, will
                press for the full amount.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have already said, I was pleased to be
                able to announce yesterday that, at long last, we have received
                EU permission to proceed with the first stage of the pig
                industry restructuring scheme. Dr Paisley asked about the aid
                that we shall give those still involved in pig production. I
                expect the Commission to approve the aid scheme for those
                producers on 13 December and for the scheme to open soon after
                that, at least by the beginning of next year. EU delays in
                approving that have been extremely frustrating, both to the
                industry and to me, and I am pleased that the lobbying that I
                urged the UK Agriculture Minister, Nick Brown, to undertake with
                the Commission has finally paid off. We shall finally be able to
                restructure the industry and develop it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that I have been able to illustrate
                the range of action that I taken in the past year. That has
                included long-term strategic planning, medium-term programme
                planning and short-term financial assistance for farmers. Those
                measures have included provision for investment in training and
                education, capital investment initiatives to promote new
                technology, initiatives on product quality and animal disease
                control, marketing and promotion, and, of course, special
                assistance for the pig sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am confident that I am doing as much as
                anyone else in my position could do to further the interests of
                the agriculture industry within the legal and policy framework
                under which I must operate. Moreover, I assure the House that I
                shall continue to do all that I can, as a Minister and member of
                the Executive Committee, to further the interests of the
                agrifood industry. I hope that I shall receive broad cross-party
                support for the important work that needs to be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the constructive tone of the
                debate. It has shown a clear understanding of the issues, as
                well as Members’ determination to tackle the problems. That is
                local democracy at work. It is a welcome development that local
                people understand the needs of their farmers and want to work in
                partnership to deal with the issues. If we have a genuine
                interest in the future of the agrifood industry and the wider
                rural society, we have a duty to work together in partnership
                with the industry to secure its future well-being. That is
                visible in the efforts that we have made to address the industry’s
                difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department and I are always ready to
                pursue opportunities that will deliver genuine benefits to the
                industry. We have pursued a wide range of initiatives in the
                past 12 months. However, I am not prepared to tie up my
                Department’s limited resources in the pursuit of the
                unworkable, the unaffordable, the unlawful or sometimes the
                downright fanciful. There is a clear difference between being
                proactive and aimlessly chasing after ghosts and shadows. I know
                the difference.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have heard today, not for the first time,
                vague accusations about what other member states are doing for
                their producers. I have heard cries of, &quot;Why can’t we do
                the same?&quot; We all work under the same common agricultural
                policy, which strictly governs what we can and cannot do. If
                anyone breaks the rules, someone will cry foul and there will
                always be serious consequences. I am not prepared to play a
                dangerous game with the livelihoods of farmers and their
                families.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We live in a rapidly changing world. We have
                to take on board EU enlargement, trade liberalisation, further
                reform of the common agricultural policy, changing consumer
                demands, and increasing competition, which I saw recently at the
                Salon International de l’Agro-Alimentaire (SIAL) Exhibition in
                France. All those things will impact on our rural economy and
                our agrifood industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is my responsibility to ensure the
                long-term viability of the industry by enabling it to meet the
                challenge of change. We face many difficulties, but there are no
                quick fixes, no easy solutions and no single initiatives. Mr
                Poots complained because I had not resolved the industry’s
                problems in my 11 months as Minister. I make no apology for
                that. I am not a miracle worker, and I do not have a direct line
                to the Almighty. We need, in partnership with the industry, to
                develop a vision of where we want the industry to be in 10 or 20
                years’ time and to develop an action plan that will set us on
                the way to achieving that goal step by step.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have tried to respond honestly and in good
                faith to the points raised in the debate. I shall deal briefly
                with the timeliness of payments. I accept that there have been
                problems but we are still on track with our published timescale
                for payment. It will not be possible for all payments to be made
                in the first week of the set period. Next year, we shall publish
                a protocol that will clarify the process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford referred to the need for a formal
                mechanism to deal with complaints. A draft is being prepared
                that will include an independent element. We shall consult with
                the industry, the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee
                and the Assembly on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall write to those Members who raised
                issues that I have been unable to address, including
                Mr&nbsp;Hussey, who raised a statistical point. I do not want
                Members to leave today with the view that my Department would be
                unwilling to take on board the views or suggestions of others. I
                do not claim to have a monopoly on wisdom, nor does my
                Department. That is why we consult with the industry and the
                Agriculture and Rural Development Committee in line with our
                statutory duty.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Dr Paisley for his intervention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have heard Mr&nbsp;Savage’s proposals,
                and I wish to examine them further. I would be glad to receive
                copies of the Danish legislation, which I shall discuss with him
                after I have examined them. Anything that can help the industry
                is good for all of us. I shall pursue any good idea as far as I
                can, but it must be workable, affordable, legal and, above all,
                in the best long-term interests of the agrifood industry and the
                rural community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to Dr Paisley’s question about
                the Haskins report, we are examining its implications for
                Northern Ireland, and when we have finished I shall write to the
                many Members who raised the matter.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the outset of today’s business, I said
                that I sought a constructive debate. My intention throughout has
                been to stimulate action to get practical results, not to create
                confrontation. The genuine distress and the growing sense of
                hopelessness felt in the farming community merits radical action
                by the Assembly and its Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my introductory speech I expressed the
                need for the Assembly to make a difference. A sense of urgency
                about developing policies is needed, especially in the light of
                the democratic deficit experienced by Northern Ireland in the
                past three decades. We must learn to have courage and be
                decisive in law making. We must realise that we are in charge
                and we must act accordingly. The other side of that equation is
                that we are responsible. Let us act responsibly and be good
                stewards of what has been put in our hands. People look to us to
                make a difference. They expect, and we must deliver.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As several Members have rightly said, farmers
                are hard-working members of the community. They do not lead an
                easy life. However, no matter how sophisticated our economy
                becomes, farming will always remain a vital part of our economic
                life. Its well-being is our well-being. Our farmers are crying
                out to be listened to. Their complaints are not an exercise in
                whingeing. They are asking to be treated the same as farmers in
                the rest of Europe. That has been a recurring theme in the
                debate. Instance after instance of our over-enforcing of
                European regulations has been detailed — we have 18-page
                forms, although two-page forms are sufficient for the same
                regulations in the Irish Republic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have said in many recent speeches that the
                Government of this country too often see their role as that of a
                policeman, enforcing rules and regulations. Rather, the
                Government should be supporting their industries, including
                farming. That is the way it is in France and other European
                countries. Governments support their industries and do not
                continually enforce regulations that are much too detailed.
                Farmers want the same raft of incentives and the same beneficial
                structures that their counterparts in the rest of the EU enjoy,
                and to which they are entitled. They are certainly entitled to
                our support and to expect a genuine effort on our part to give
                them a level playing field.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is much to be proud of in our
                achievements in agriculture: the quality of our produce; its
                reputation for greenness; and the uniqueness of our traceability
                scheme for beef. There is much that is commendable about the
                agriculture sector, but it needs to be nurtured by the Assembly
                and its Executive. The House and the Department of Agriculture
                and Rural Development must move towards creating a legislative
                framework that will enable a capital restructuring of the
                agriculture sector along the lines that I have suggested.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The scheme will enable older farmers to
                retire with dignity. It will enable young blood to enter farming
                with new, fresh ideas and with a new drive towards excellence
                based on state-of-the-art methods. The legislative measures
                being considered in the Programme for Government contain much
                that is in consumers’ interests. That is only right. As a
                farmer, I know that it is consumers’ interests that govern the
                market. However, the consumers need the agricultural producers
                too. That is not a relationship in which one exploits the other;
                it is a relationship of mutual benefit. It needs to be a win-win
                situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consumers have benefited through the
                operation of many market forces in recent years. The advent of
                large out-of-town supermarkets and the fierce competition among
                them has made it a consumers’ market. Prices have fallen,
                though it has to be said that the price to the consumers has
                fallen a lot less than the price that the big supermarkets pay
                to the farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farmgate prices are chronically low, the
                downside of which is that the agriculture sector has been
                dangerously exposed and weakened. For that to continue without
                some regulation, intervention, or strengthening of the farmers’
                position in other ways will fatally undermine the agriculture
                industry. None of us can afford that to happen, and in our heart
                of hearts, we all know that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague Mr Leslie painted a chilling
                picture of what would happen if market forces were allowed to
                continue to ravage agriculture. If the Government do not
                intervene to regulate that process, that will be an abdication
                of responsibility. A new Northern Ireland agriculture law, based
                on those elements of Danish law and French practice that I
                mentioned earlier, would put in place a structure and mechanism
                that could transform the situation. The Danish legislation is a
                model for action. It has been translated, and I shall let the
                Minister have a copy.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the suggestion that meetings should
                be arranged between me and the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development to address the matter. I hope that the Minister will
                enable that to happen, and I am prepared to work hard to help to
                develop legislation to restructure the farming sector.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been many expressions of support,
                not least from Dr&nbsp;Paisley, for a close examination of the
                scheme and its implementation. We have time to implement it, but
                not as much as we think. That is why I call for people to be
                proactive. Rightly or wrongly, there is a widely held perception
                in the farming community that the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development could do more and care more.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development must not catch the disease of indifference. It must
                develop a spirit of independence. Scotland is showing signs of
                independence from Westminster’s detailed supervision, and so
                must we. The direct rule Ministers have gone, and the baleful
                influence of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food no
                longer casts such a long shadow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The facile idea that training would help to
                solve farming’s ills should be abandoned. An ombudsman scheme,
                as has been adopted in Scotland, would probably be welcome here,
                and the Department has the ability to look after any such
                scheme. That would show that the Department does not want to be
                the judge and jury, and that it wants to stop being a policeman.
                The same is true of training, which should keep people in the
                farming industry rather than encourage them to leave it,
                especially our young people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many areas could be addressed quickly. The
                promotion of our traceability scheme for beef as a marketing
                tool to sell Northern Ireland beef in European markets that have
                recently been blighted by the BSE scare springs to mind. The
                Minister told the House last week that she felt the time was not
                right, but there was widespread feeling throughout the Assembly
                that her decision should have been different. It is a decision
                that suits our competitors who do not have such a traceability
                scheme in operation. It will take time to raise our marketing
                profile, so now is the time to start.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is much disquiet among farmers about
                apparent inaction, but my primary concern in today’s debate
                has been to set out proposals for a new structure that will be
                of long-term benefit to the entire agriculture community. Short-termism,
                however, is not the answer to the serious situation that the
                farming industry faces. Individual measures can help to
                alleviate an immediate problem. However, new structures and
                mechanisms need to be put in place to facilitate the long-term
                restructuring of agriculture and to allow a breathing space in
                which that can happen in a calm atmosphere rather than in an
                atmosphere of panic. My proposals for a farmers’ retirement
                scheme and a young farmers’ loan scheme would provide such a
                structure. As for Mr&nbsp;McGrady’s fears that financiers
                might have a field day, I say that financiers, like lawyers, are
                a necessary evil.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the outset, it was intended that this
                motion would be non-confrontational. It was designed to generate
                a serious and constructive debate on an issue of great concern
                to everyone. The debate has done that. However, words in a
                debate are not enough; there must be a real and practical
                follow-through. Now that the Danish self-help scheme is on the
                table, it must not be swept under it. What is needed is an
                injection of new blood.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of my constituent, Mrs Jean
                McBride, and her family, I raise the issue of the recent
                decision to retain Guardsmen Wright and Fisher in the Army. That
                decision has caused much outrage and concern in my constituency
                of North Belfast. For many of my constituents, their
                reinstatement flies in the face of the basic principles of
                justice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me relate the basic facts of the case. On
                the bright morning of 4 September 1992, Peter McBride, aged 18,
                visited his sister in Edlingham Street in the New Lodge Road
                area of north Belfast. After that visit he was stopped by an
                Army foot patrol near Trainfield Street. The commander of the
                patrol questioned the youth and searched him thoroughly. He also
                searched a white T-shirt, which he was carrying when he was
                stopped. The T-shirt had been washed by his sister Róisín, and
                he had collected it from her home. After five or six minutes in
                the presence of the Army patrol, Peter McBride suddenly broke
                away from the soldiers and took off at speed. He vaulted over a
                garden wall into Spamount Street, ran down that street, turned
                left into Glenrosa Street and then right into Upper Meadow
                Street. He was pursued by the soldiers, with Guardsmen Wright
                and Fisher in the vanguard. The soldiers called on him to stop,
                but he did not — he kept running at a fast pace. At that
                point, Guardsmen Wright and Fisher opened fire on Peter McBride.
                Two bullets struck him in the back, killing him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At their trial, in February 1995, the trial
                judge, Lord Justice Kelly, a former Member of the Northern
                Ireland Parliament and a former Attorney-General in the Unionist
                Government at Stormont, found that evidence given by Fisher and
                Wright had been both evasive and untruthful and that they had
                both lied about material aspects of the case. In particular, he
                was satisfied that they had seen Peter McBride being searched by
                their commander. He regarded Fisher’s defence that he believed
                that Peter McBride had been carrying a coffee-jar bomb in a
                white paper or plastic bag to be untruthful. Peter McBride was
                retreating from the guardsmen all the time, increasing the
                distance between them over the three streets. He also found that
                the incident was not a panic situation that required a
                split-second decision or a split-second action, if any action
                was required at all. He also found that the defence case that
                the guardsmen believed that Peter McBride was carrying a coffee
                jar to be false. The trial judge found that the two soldiers had
                deliberately aimed shots at Peter McBride, who posed no threat
                to them at all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lord Justice Kelly clearly found that there
                was no good reason to fire at Peter McBride and that there was
                no justification for Fisher having fired when he did. The judge
                concluded that Wright had deliberately lied about his reasons
                for firing and that, at the time of firing, he did not believe
                that there was any justification to do so. Therefore, both
                soldiers’ defences were thoroughly discredited. The Northern
                Ireland Court of Appeal heard the soldiers’ appeals and
                conducted a lengthy review of both cases. Their appeals were
                unanimously dismissed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have spent considerable time outlining the
                facts of the case, as determined by the court alone. It is
                important to remember that those are the judicially determined
                facts. I have not included assertions or determinations of
                anyone outside the courts. On 2 December 1998, both soldiers
                were released early on licence from their life sentences by the
                then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. They resumed their
                military duties that month.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Their release was made under normal
                life-sentence review procedures rather than under the Good
                Friday Agreement. However, I accept that it would have been
                politically impossible for the Government to release other
                prisoners under the agreement while keeping the two soldiers in
                prison. The early release of those men was a bitter pill for the
                McBride family to swallow, as it was for many others in my
                constituency. Nevertheless, it could not properly be argued that
                the soldiers did not deserve to benefit — like so many others
                caught up in the troubles — from the prisoner release scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, at the heart of the issue is not
                their early release, which most people now reluctantly accept,
                but their reinstatement in the Army. Under the Queen’s
                Regulations for the Army 1975, it is presumed that a soldier
                sentenced to imprisonment by a civilian court will be discharged
                unless exceptional reasons exist that make his retention
                desirable. That is the only test that can be applied to those
                two soldiers. Therefore, the question is whether exceptional
                reasons emerged from an objective and honest scrutiny of the
                facts of the case that I have just outlined.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Army — through the Army Board, which is
                made up of senior Army officers and a junior Army Minister —
                had to determine whether there were exceptional reasons that
                made it desirable to retain the guardsmen, notwithstanding their
                convictions for murder their life imprisonment sentences.
                According to the Northern Ireland High Court, the Army Board was
                wrong to decide in 1998 that the soldiers should be retained on
                account of the argument put forward that they had made an error
                of judgement. The trial judge had clearly rejected that
                argument, since he regarded their defence as a lying one.
                Therefore, no error of judgement arose.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Army Board’s decision was judicially
                reviewed and subsequently quashed. The judge at the review was
                of the opinion that the guardsmen’s application to be retained
                in the Army had to be considered afresh. Their application for
                retention in the Army was recently heard again by a differently
                constituted Army Board. Despite the fact that the second Army
                Board rejected the &quot;error of judgement&quot; argument, it
                unbelievably came to the same decision — that the guardsmen
                should be retained for Army service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the facts that I have carefully
                rehearsed, it beggars belief that the Army Board could properly
                have arrived at that same decision to retain two convicted
                murderers in the Army. In view of the facts, as found by the
                Northern Ireland courts, no reasonable person could properly
                conclude that exceptional reasons existed that makes their
                retention desirable. There are exceptionally good reasons to do
                precisely the opposite. If there were exceptional reasons to
                retain them, let us know what they are. What makes it desirable
                to retain two convicted murderers in the Army?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Army Board’s decision were to be
                accepted as correct — in justice or in politics — the
                stature of our courts and our judges would be diminished. The
                decision implies that at least four judges arrived at
                judicially- flawed decisions in convicting those murderers.
                Equally, it suggests that the Northern Ireland judiciary is of
                no real consequence and that we have an inferior form of
                justice. Despite the fact that no contrition was shown by
                Guardsman Wright and that only partial contrition was expressed
                by Guardsman Fisher in May 1995, three months after his
                conviction, they were permitted back into the Army, with access
                to highly-powered and lethal weapons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More disturbing is the report that both
                soldiers are referring their convictions to the Criminal Cases
                Review Commission (CCRC). That completely undermines any
                possible residual element of contrition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us remember that those men were not
                confined to paper pushing or potato peeling. They were sent to a
                dangerous theatre of war — Kosovo — where the risk of
                engagement with either regular or paramilitary forces was very
                high. By order of the Army Board, they are prevented from
                serving in Northern Ireland, as to do so is deemed
                inappropriate. Why is it deemed inappropriate for those men to
                serve in Northern Ireland but appropriate enough for them to
                serve in war-torn Kosovo? Does that decision display any
                consistency? What sort of message does that send out to the rest
                of the Army? Murder, the most grievous act of criminality, can
                be committed in Northern Ireland and those responsible will be
                looked after by the Army. A Northern Ireland citizen can be
                killed with impunity. So far as Northern Ireland is concerned,
                double standards can and will apply.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What would the reaction be in Britain if
                soldiers had murdered a citizen in inner-city Birmingham? Has
                anyone in the House any doubt that such soldiers would not be
                retained in the Army? If they were, could Members imagine the
                anger and outrage in Britain? Could Members imagine the outrage
                and anger if the British Medical Association were to readmit
                into its ranks, as a practising doctor, someone who had murdered
                a patient?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This case says that the murder of a citizen
                in inner-city Belfast is treated differently because, in some
                way, inner-city Belfast is different. Although the soldiers were
                convicted of murder, it was not really murder as understood by
                the Army. That has serious implications not only for Nationalist
                citizens but also for Unionist citizens.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What twisted mentality leads the military
                mind to perversely contort judicially decided facts, and to go
                through further contortions and obviously contrived hoops to end
                up with the decision to retain two men unworthy of the title

                drug-related offences and most have been convicted. The Army has
                discharged 108 of them. What sort of message does that send out,
                either to those in the Army or to the public at large? Is the
                rationale laid down by those decisions that it is more

                How could the Army (or, indeed, any civilian population they
                were charged with protecting) trust them to act professionally
                in the future? Ministers Mandelson and Hoon should make every

                defies the ordinary sense of justice in Northern Ireland or,
                indeed, elsewhere in the world. It exposes double standards
                being applied by the Army to its personnel. It exposes double
                standards being applied by the Government to the people of
                Northern Ireland and, in particular, to the long-suffering
                people of north Belfast — not least, the deeply hurt family of

                expect better from the Government, and I appeal to them to
                examine the decision’s enormous injustice and to reverse it.
                No self-respecting democratic Government can knowingly tolerate

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that this is a tragic case
                of a serious error of judgement on the part of two soldiers
                under stress on the streets of Belfast. They were convicted and
                served six years before being released on licence in 1998, in
                the aftermath of the Belfast Agreement. It is unfortunate that
                this debate is taking place today, because security is a
                reserved matter. The debate that the SDLP wishes to have should
                have taken place in the House of Commons, where such matters are
                usually dealt with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We might today have been better served
                discussing the enormous postal crisis in the lead-up to
                Christmas. Could this be a blatant attempt at electioneering on
                the part of the SDLP, to &quot;out-Sinn Féin&quot; Sinn Féin?
                The issue has been used by Sinn Féin and its so-called justice
                groups to carry out a vendetta against the Government and the
                Security Forces. It smacks of double standards. There was no
                hubbub from those groups about Garda collusion or the role of
                Fianna Fáil in the formation of the Provisional IRA. There was
                no investigation of 30 years of murders by the Provisional IRA,
                even though a substantial number of its victims came from the
                Nationalist community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever the rights and wrongs of this case,
                we must try to put the past 30 years behind us. The Belfast
                Agreement was a watershed and an opportunity to move on.
                Hundreds of prisoners have been released, and millions of pounds
                are being spent on rehabilitation and making a new start. In an
                edition of Hansard last week there is a list of all the
                organisations into which money is currently being poured, such
                as ex-prisoners’ organisations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a former senior IRA commander in the
                Government of this country. Other Assembly Members have been
                convicted of the most hideous offences. The two soldiers were,
                in the opinion of a court, considered to have paid their debt to
                society, and thus were released on licence. It is time to allow
                all those who wish to move on and make a new start to rebuild
                their lives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Belfast Agreement is to mean anything,
                particular sections of the community must enter into the spirit

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Member that the matter
                should have been debated in the House of Commons, where the SDLP
                has three Members. I was at the debate on the matter in the
                House of Commons, and I do not recall hearing any intervention
                from any of them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any murder is a tragedy. I understand well
                the feelings of those who lose people in such circumstances.
                However, it is ironic and absolute humbug for the mover of the
                Adjournment motion to draw parallels and say that those things
                should not be when he and his Colleagues worked their hardest to
                put into the Government of Northern Ireland those who headed up
                an organisation — the IRA — that performed such dastardly
                deeds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I find it strange to hear the same Mr
                Maginness defending the court. Had this been another case, the
                Member and his Colleagues would have been challenging the court
                and picking holes in its judgement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said one thing in Westminster that I shall
                repeat today. Those two men did not go on to the streets of
                Belfast to commit murder. They did not plan the night before to
                take some people out and shoot them. They did nothing of the
                kind. The IRA — and some of its members sitting in the House
                today are active and were active in the IRA — planned and
                killed deliberately. Mr&nbsp;Maginness tries to excuse the
                Government, but it is his friend, Mr Mandelson, who is
                responsible. It is his friend, Mr Hoon, who is responsible. He
                should not try to pass the buck to an Army Board. He knows
                perfectly well what Mr Hoon and the Secretary of State have
                said. He should not try to blame anonymous people sitting on an
                Army Board, because the Government are responsible for this act.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As has been emphasised, those people went to
                prison. They served their time. They were put on licence. They
                paid their debt to society. That should have been the end of it,
                but, of course, the same Mr Maginness is quite happy to have IRA
                men in the new police force, and to put out 50% of the
                Protestants so that they can get 50% of his own kind in. It is a
                strange thing that he is going to get the IRA into the new
                police force about which he always talks and argues. Those men
                committed an act under drastic and terrible circumstances, and
                it must be drastic and terrible for them and everyone else
                involved. However, they were not murderers who went on to the
                streets of Belfast to commit murder — even Mr Maginness cannot
                indict them of that and prove that they were.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr G Kelly:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The
                killing of north Belfast teenager Peter McBride goes directly to
                the heart of the relationship between Irish Nationalists and the
                British Government in Ireland. Peter McBride’s case is not the
                only one. Almost 400 Nationalists were killed as a direct result
                of Crown forces’ activity. Many of those killings were
                planned, as were hundreds more as a result of collusion with
                Loyalist murder gangs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Peter would have been just another forgotten
                name or statistic if it had not been for two factors. One was
                the dogged and brave insistence of his parents and family, who
                did not, and will not, let this human rights issue be buried.
                The other is the British Army’s stubborn stupidity and racism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The facts are as painful as they are clear.
                In 1992, Peter McBride, at the young age of 18, was stopped
                close to his home and thoroughly searched by a Scots Guards foot
                patrol. It has never been in dispute that he was unarmed. After
                he was searched, two soldiers, Wright and Fisher, shot Peter
                McBride in the back as he ran away, killing him. They were
                charged with murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. They
                were two of only a handful of soldiers ever to be convicted of
                any of the hundreds of killings carried out by the forces of the
                Crown. They had served less than six years when they were
                hurriedly released. The British Army should have discharged
                them, but it did not. Had Peter McBride been British and lived
                in London or Liverpool, we might safely assume that the soldiers
                involved would have been discharged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was a painful experience for all of Peter’s
                family. More pain was to come when the British Army Board twice
                ruled that Fisher and Wright could remain in the Army. In the
                midst of their hurt and grief, Peter’s family took a judicial
                review to the High Court to challenge that decision. The court
                overturned the Army Board’s ruling and instructed it to
                reconsider. Allegedly, another board was put up, which
                reconsidered the matter and came to the same unfortunate
                conclusion. Since 1995, when Fisher and Wright were convicted,
                many soldiers have been dismissed from the British Army after
                positive drugs tests. It would be hard for anyone to come to any
                conclusion other than that the British Government look on the
                murder of Irish people by the forces of the British Crown as
                little more than a misdemeanour.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What the McBrides want from the British
                Government is straightforward. They want recognition that Peter
                was innocent — a victim, a human being just like any other —

                They want to grieve for Peter instead of watching his killers
                being patted on the back by the British Government. They do not
                want those two men to be handed back their rifles so that they
                can repeat their performance on someone else’s son; they want
                recognition that Peter and his family are the victims. In the
                scheme of things, that is not much for which to ask. Instead of
                being allowed to grieve properly, they are being publicly
                slapped in the face again and again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The actions of the British Ministry of
                Defence are racist. It thinks that it does not matter because
                Peter was just a &quot;Paddy&quot;. It affects us all,
                especially when one considers the timing of the Ministry of
                Defence’s announcement in the middle of the deepest crisis
                that the peace process has faced since the signing of the Good
                Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I leave it to Jean McBride to articulate her
                feelings. In her statement, I see the determination, commitment
                and stamina that the British Government have underestimated to
                their cost and shame in the past. Speaking after she heard the
                British Ministry of Defence decision on 24 November, she said
                she was</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;completely devastated by the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;but if they think that I am going to
                give up they have another thing coming. They think that Peter’s
                life is worth nothing — shoot him in the back and forget about
                him. We will fight on until these two murderers are kicked out.
                Tony Blair should be ashamed of himself. The anniversary of
                Peter’s birthday is next week and if they think that I brought
                my son into this world to have him murdered and forgotten, then
                they just don’t understand what it is to be a mother.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, needs
                to know that this is a courageous family that cannot be
                dismissed. Peter’s mother, father and the rest of the family
                can be sure that they will not be fighting on their own. The
                British Prime Minister must accept that Irish people are not
                non-people. They need to be able to grieve and to know that
                soldiers who murder Irish people will be punished, not rewarded.
                He needs to tell his Defence Secretary, Geoff Hoon, to kick
                Wright and Fisher out of the British Army.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today the SDLP is yet again demonstrating a
                totally hypocritical stance. Throughout 30 years of terror the
                SDLP has condemned violence while not hesitating to profit
                politically from it. The SDLP is always telling Unionists that
                we should forget the past. Therefore, why does the SDLP create
                an issue about Guardsmen Fisher and Wright today? There is no
                necessity to re-open the court case and to re-enact it in the
                Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP demonstrates sheer hypocrisy with
                its selective condemnation of the two Scots Guardsmen, James
                Fisher and Mark Wright. The SDLP supports the disbandment of the
                Royal Ulster Constabulary and the release of terrorist
                prisoners, including the release of Provisional IRA terrorists
                who have murdered hundreds of innocent Protestants, Roman
                Catholics and members of the security forces.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP wants mass murderers to be able to
                hold positions on policing boards and for the law-abiding people
                of Northern Ireland to accept terrorists in Government,
                including having a terrorist hold the position of Minister of
                Education. The SDLP has endorsed a convicted terrorist as a
                Minister in the Government of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP wants the two guardsmen removed from
                the Army, yet it wants the people of Northern Ireland to stomach
                Martin McGuinness as the Minister of Education even though he
                has held the position of Chief of Staff of the Provisional IRA,
                as well as being a convicted terrorist. Martin McGuinness was
                once named as Britain’s number-one terrorist by ‘The Cook

                prepared, but it adds much more to the debate when a degree of
                flexibility and response to the debate is possible. I urge all
                Members to enter into the spirit of the debate rather than be
                wholly restricted to a script. It also makes it easier to

                one, his wife asked what was wrong with the other one.
                Inevitably when one makes a reference it will be to one Member,
                and that Member will feel picked upon. I assure the Member that
                I am not picking on him. Rather, I refer to the general
                principle. However, I raised it in respect of him because he

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no requirement to revisit the
                position of the two guardsmen, and Alban&nbsp;Maginness is being
                mischievous in doing so. It must be borne in mind that Peter
                McBride had a number of criminal convictions and had been
                running away from the soldiers at the time he was shot. One
                soldier believed that Peter McBride had opened fire on him, and
                another believed that Peter McBride was about to throw a lethal
                coffee-jar bomb at him. At that time, soldiers and police were
                being shot, bombed and murdered daily throughout Northern
                Ireland, and coffee-jar bomb attacks were a daily occurrence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a letter to ‘The Times’ after the
                trial, the two soldiers’ commanding officer, Lt-Col Tim
                Spicer, wrote:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I am completely satisfied that neither
                of these young soldiers had anything other than the firmly held
                and honest belief that they were involved in a terrorist
                incident and therefore acted entirely in good faith, in
                accordance with the law, the rules of engagement and their
                military training.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maginness’s motion graphically
                illustrates the anti-British Army bias of the SDLP and the rest
                of the pan-Nationalist front. That bias has not changed in
                30&nbsp;years. Therefore, his argument lacks all credibility,
                and the vast majority of people in Northern&nbsp;Ireland will
                see that. The two soldiers were doing a difficult job in a
                violent environment, and most people believe that they should
                never have been jailed under such circumstances.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Agnew:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the debate serves no other purpose, it
                highlights the fundamental differences in the mindsets of the
                Nationalist and Unionist sides. Nationalists and Republicans
                were in favour of the release, under the terms of the Belfast
                Agreement, of the Shankill&nbsp;Road bomber, who was guilty of
                mass murder. He spent less time in jail than the two Scots
                Guardsmen. The Shankill Road bomber will have received funding
                to help his rehabilitation into society, and, as in many cases,
                he was no doubt in receipt of much more than many of the victims
                who lost their loved ones. No one on the Republican side
                objected to the release or to the moneys received, and no one
                objected to such a person being gainfully employed. The actions
                of the Shankill&nbsp;Road bomber were the result of careful
                planning. His callous actions were deliberate and premeditated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contrast that with the reaction to the
                release of the two guardsmen, Mark&nbsp;Wright and
                James&nbsp;Fisher. Unlike the Shankill&nbsp;Road bomber, they
                did not go out to deliberately maim and kill. Their actions were
                not the result of careful planning. Peter&nbsp;McBride was a
                petty criminal running away from the law when he was shot.
                Arguably, that was not a crime that should have resulted in him
                being shot dead, but tensions were high in the area. Two days
                previously, a colleague of the two Scots Guardsmen was callously
                shot dead by the Provisional&nbsp;IRA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The soldiers made a genuine mistake, yet they
                have been accused, by Republicans in particular, of murder.
                Should a mistake be termed &quot;murder&quot;, as was the case
                here? Unfortunately, the matter is now being used as a political
                football and many statements, especially from Republicans, reek
                of revenge and pure vindictiveness. Is anyone asking Sinn&nbsp;Féin
                to purge itself of convicted murderers and criminals?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I should draw Members’ attention to
                the terms in which they are referring to the outcome of judicial
                proceedings. It seems to me that querying the outcome of
                judicial proceedings can properly be done only by substantive
                motion. At Westminster, the findings of a superior court may not
                be queried by way of remarks or statements — only by way of a
                substantive motion. Some remarks today query the outcome of a
                court case. There may be a question as to the precise standing
                of this place as a court, but it is proper for me to draw the
                matter to Members’ attention and to advise them to be cautious
                in that regard. I will study Hansard and look at the matter, not
                only in respect of this debate but in respect of others. I would
                appreciate Members’ being cautious in querying the findings of
                properly constituted courts.</p>

                your advice on such matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is anyone asking Sinn Féin to purge the
                party of the convicted murderers and criminals in its ranks?
                They have been convicted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, it was almost mandatory to have a
                conviction to qualify for Sinn Féin membership. However,
                hypocritically, the Army is expected to purge its ranks of those
                who have paid their debt to society. Those two soldiers acted
                without malice. It was an unfortunate tragedy, and now they are
                being persecuted while hard-line terrorists, who went out to
                murder, are released from jail early. Those soldiers deserve
                justice and fairness, not further punishment through a vicious
                and vengeful campaign aimed at taking away their chosen career.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue is wider than the individuals
                concerned. The Assembly is aware, as we work to build confidence
                in the Army and the other security services, of our concern that
                the decision to reinstate the two guardsmen could imply that the
                Army is above the law. People are right to have high
                expectations of the security forces. We expect them to be fair
                and efficient and to enshrine the principles of democracy and
                justice. People will be rightly disappointed to see soldiers who
                have been found guilty of murder — the most serious of crimes
                in a court of law — return to their regiments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People will also be confused by the
                contradictory judgements in these cases, which will serve only
                to undermine trust in the Army. Independent assessors and
                observers have also raised concerns. Soldiers have been
                dismissed for lesser crimes, as has already been stated. Surely
                murder should be treated much more seriously.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am somewhat saddened that this has become a
                Unionist versus Nationalist debate, argument and fight. I have
                not gleaned any sense of humanity or feeling for those who were
                wronged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The decision by the Army Board to reinstate
                Messrs Wright and Fisher caused huge problems for many people. I
                do not speak about those who take any and every opportunity to
                strike out at the security forces or those to whom I would refer
                as Army &quot;bashers&quot;; I am talking about honest, decent
                people who have supported law and order down through the years
                when the forces of law and order were subjected to attacks from
                terrorists on both sides of the proverbial house. I firmly
                contend that the decision to reinstate those men was wrong. It
                was both insensitive and counterproductive and could bring the
                Army and forces of law and order into disrepute.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not need to rehearse further the
                arguments or the circumstances that surround the tragic death of
                Peter McBride. They have already been well rehearsed and
                documented, although, given what I have heard during the debate,
                some people still seem to have some of the facts wrong.
                Moreover, I do not need to rehearse the events that took place
                at the subsequent trial of the two soldiers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is suffice it to say that Peter McBride
                was shot dead and that two soldiers were found guilty of murder.
                Those are the incontrovertible facts. No one has suggested that
                Peter McBride ought to have been shot dead or that the two
                soldiers should not have been found guilty of a crime. If we
                live in this land of &quot;maybe&quot;, &quot;what if&quot; and
                &quot;what not&quot;, perhaps the soldiers made a mistake.
                Perhaps the charge was wrong. Perhaps Peter should not have run.
                However, those &quot;maybes&quot; and &quot;what ifs&quot;
                cannot alter the brutal fact that Peter McBride is dead. The
                soldiers shot him, and they were found guilty of murder.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To dismiss those facts as simply a mistake
                — &quot;The poor soldiers made a mistake&quot; — or an error
                of judgement diminishes human life. There is no mistake, no
                error of judgement that anyone could possibly make that could
                have greater consequences than the destruction of human life,
                and no apologies can undo that error or that wrong. That mistake
                is not the same as a mistake of indiscipline, insubordination,
                or drunkenness. I understand that soldiers have been dismissed
                from the Army for those reasons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People are only dismissed from the Army
                because the Army must be seen to be a disciplined force in the
                eyes of everyone. How can it be seen to be a disciplined force
                if it includes within its ranks those who have been found guilty
                of murder? How can it be seen as a disciplined force if those
                who make that type of error — and let us assume that it was an
                error of judgement — are within its ranks? Are we to give a
                second chance, through reinstatement, so that those individuals
                carrying weapons of death can make the same mistake again? No.
                The price of another error of judgement is a price that I, and
                society, would not be prepared to pay, because it is the price
                of a human life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The decision to reinstate the two soldiers
                has driven a huge stake through the family of Peter McBride. It
                is insensitive and has not taken their feelings into account.
                Some will say, &quot;What about those other murderers that we
                see on the streets, those who have been released under the Good
                Friday Agreement?&quot; People who make that point miss the
                point. If society makes that point, it misses the point. The law
                is there to defend the general public. Those within the forces
                of law and order who abuse or sink below those standards do a
                great disservice to the people that they try to serve. To
                compare them to terrorists is a disservice to the general
                public.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dalton:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, but I must make it
                clear that I do so out of individual choice and am not speaking
                on behalf of my party. The case is a terrible tragedy. One young
                man is dead and two others carry the dual burden of a conviction
                and their own conscience. I had hoped that this debate might be
                more than just a sectarian slanging match, but, unfortunately,
                it appears that Members are unable to look beyond their own
                sectarian interests. They have to prove how much of a super-Prod
                or super-Taig they can be in the House, rather than deal with
                the real issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have grave concerns about the retention of
                Guardsmen Fisher and Wright in the Scots Guards following their
                conviction for murder, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal.
                I agree with Mr Maginness that, while other prisoners were
                benefiting from early release, it was correct that those men
                should also have been released from prison. The issue is whether
                they should be retained as members of the British Army. That is
                the subject of our debate, not whether they should have been
                released, and not whether they are part of a general ambiguity
                towards the wrongdoings of the past in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My comments should not be taken as criticism
                of the British Army. I am not here to bash the British Army. I
                am a former member, unlike those who have tried to defend the
                Army today, with the exception of my Colleague Mr McFarland. The
                circumstances are specific to the individual cases that we are
                discussing. The British Army has an honourable record in
                Northern Ireland. A third of a million men have served in
                Northern Ireland during the past 30 years. More than 650 of them
                have given their lives, and more than 6,000 carry wounds that
                constantly remind them of their service. Their record is an
                honourable one, and they have served their country and this
                community admirably.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My comments should not be seen as supportive
                of Republican-inspired vendettas against the security forces.
                Those community groups who purport to defend justice seem to
                apply that term only to certain victims. Their attitude appears
                to be basically sectarian. If groups such as the Pat Finucane
                Centre or the Committee on the Administration of Justice really
                seek justice for all, when will they take up, for example, the
                cases of Chief Inspector Harry Breen and Superintendent Bob
                Buchanan, who were murdered by the Provisional IRA in South
                Armagh as a direct result of Garda collusion? Does their concept
                of justice not extend to members of the RUC?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for the Members of Sinn Féin, I have no
                doubt that they have stood in the Chamber with straight faces
                and talked about human rights, justice and the terror of the
                British Army. I remind the House that the single biggest killer
                of the Nationalist people in Belfast was the Provisional IRA.
                The number of those killed by the police and the Army — and
                many of those killed were active terrorists in the course of
                acts of violence — is barely a quarter of the number killed by
                the Provisional IRA. The real oppressors of the Nationalist
                people were, and still are, the Provisional IRA. The spokesmen
                who talk about rights and justice while their colleagues
                brutalise their own community nightly make me laugh.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having said that, we must remember that the
                issue being debated today is one of principle. The crime of
                Guardsmen Fisher and Wright is different to many committed in
                this country. It is not comparable to those who deliberately
                plan brutal murders, but it was still a crime. It was murder
                even though it was mitigated, to a degree, by the circumstances.
                The fact that Fisher and Wright committed the murder while
                wearing the Queen’s uniform should not be an excuse. In
                principle, I doubt that many in the House believe that someone
                convicted of serious crimes prior to application should serve in
                the police or the Army. It is not acceptable for an ex-IRA man
                or a ex-UVF man to be in the security forces, so why is an
                exception being made this time?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, the circumstances of that case are
                different. Those two men were soldiers, operating in a difficult
                situation. They were young men doing a tough job as best they
                could. However, they made a terrible and fatal mistake, and they
                failed in their duty. I ask people to step back from the emotion
                and remember the cold facts. Peter McBride was an innocent
                18-year-old man who was out in broad daylight on 4 September
                1992. He was stopped by an Army patrol and searched. During that
                time he got involved in an altercation with team commander Sgt
                Swift, and he ran from the patrol. He was pursued and, from a
                distance of approximately 80 to 90 yards, was shot twice in the
                back and fatally wounded. He crawled into an alley behind
                Hillman Street and lay dying.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask Members, especially those on this side
                of the House, to remember that. An innocent and unarmed citizen
                of the United Kingdom was killed by soldiers of the United
                Kingdom Army, on the streets of the United Kingdom, in
                circumstances that a United Kingdom judge sitting in a United
                Kingdom court found to constitute murder. That should be a
                matter of concern to everyone, whether Unionist or Nationalist.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I acknowledge the speeches of the
                previous three Members who spoke in this debate. Mr&nbsp;Agnew
                said that this is a campaign motivated by, as he put it, revenge
                and vindictiveness. If there is one truth about this particular
                campaign, it is that neither revenge nor vindictiveness
                motivates Peter McBride’s family. They want closure on the
                issue and to put the matter behind them without any further
                revenge, reparation or prosecution. That point should be
                acknowledged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have learnt, belatedly, that the purpose
                of the debate is to raise this issue and to raise it in a way
                that will let people step back from their instinct to defend or
                condemn the Army and allow them to make an informed judgement
                about the conduct of two soldiers on the streets of north
                Belfast in 1992. As we have learnt — belatedly — that can
                happen, and it has happened before.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Boyd said that the motion is motivated by
                anti-British Army bias, but there are others who disagree. To
                say that those soldiers — who had been given specific
                responsibilities for the security and maintenance of the law in
                Northern Ireland — can return to the Army and continue as
                before is something that I have real difficulty in accepting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Others, such as the Moderator of the
                Presbyterian Church, have said that they find real difficulties
                with the soldiers’ reinstatement. That is not evidence of
                anti-British or anti-British Army bias. Mr McFarland said that
                we should pursue vendettas. I think that shows that this is not
                a vendetta.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, I do not agree that we should
                forget the past; we should deal with the past. We need a truth
                process that will address properly and creatively all the harsh
                things that have been done and said. In that context, the matter
                under discussion has not been carefully selected but is part of
                a wider truth and reconciliation process that can help to inform
                our society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley acknowledged that those who have
                suffered bereavement in the North continue to suffer. I want to
                acknowledge that he said that. I might even agree with him that,
                on that day, those soldiers did not go out to murder. I do not
                know what was in their heads and hearts on that day and at that
                time, but Dr Paisley might well be right about that. However, it
                is also true that, just as Loyalist paramilitary armies in the
                North went out with murder in their heads and their hearts,
                there were elements in the British Army, especially in the
                Forces Research Unit (FRU), who went out with that intention.
                Those in the British Army who were responsible for the murder of
                Pat Finucane, among others, should be called to account sooner
                rather than later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr Maginness said, the report of the Army
                Board will, sooner or later, come out. When it does, we must all
                ask ourselves the questions that the Army Board answered in the
                affirmative. First, were there exceptional circumstances to
                justify the return of the soldiers to the British Army?
                Secondly, on that day, were people in the area carrying
                coffee-jar bombs and was the situation tense? If we conclude
                that none of those circumstances applied, we must ask whether it
                is legitimate to allow people who used their guns to murder to
                use those guns in the future.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard breathtaking hypocrisy from the
                Members opposite. The Member for North Belfast, Mr Maginness,
                usually comes to the House piously wringing his hands and
                telling us that he will never contribute to any debate that
                might be contentious. He appeals to us from his perch of piety
                to withdraw from any debate that could be regarded as
                contentious. Today, he has brought a highly contentious issue to
                the House. As the Member for North Down, Mr McFarland, said, the
                issue should not have been brought to the House, because another
                place has responsibility for such matters. It is regrettable
                that the SDLP has done so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not object to our debating the issue,
                but I object strongly to SDLP hypocrisy. Many of the words that
                they have uttered will come back to haunt them. In many other
                places — whether he has been elected to them or not — John
                Hume, whom, I believe, has never spoken in this House, tells
                people to draw a line under the past. So much for that —
                today, Front-Bench SDLP Members have raked over the dirt and
                stirred the embers of the past. They want to rub people’s
                noses in it; that is what is so contemptible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The McBride family deserves sympathy.
                However, the way that the family’s case has been treated by
                Nationalist and Republican representatives in the House
                diminishes the respect and the sympathy that they have gained.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the McBride family is entitled to
                sympathy, the Fisher and Wright families — and, indeed,
                Guardsmen Fisher and Wright — are also entitled to sympathy
                for the difficult job that young men were asked to do in the
                streets because of butchers who are represented in the House
                today. Mr Maginness said many things, such as it was &quot;a
                bitter pill for the McBride family to swallow&quot;,
                &quot;unworthy of the title ‘soldier’&quot;, &quot;they defy
                justice&quot; and &quot;double standards&quot;. All of that can
                be said about the Belfast Agreement, and how it released many
                other of this society’s killers, but I did not hear it from
                him. Not once did he utter any such condemnation. Why does the
                Member fail to table a motion about the unworthiness of people
                in Government who have been convicted? Why does he not do that?
                Why does he not join with me today and sign such a motion? I do
                not believe he has reached this new high moral ground. He said
                that it is a bitter pill to swallow. It certainly is a bitter
                pill when prisoners’ groups get £6 million, as was seen
                across the Province last weekend. There is no doubt that if we
                are going to apply the new Maginness standards of defying
                justice — &quot;bitter pill&quot; and &quot;double
                standards&quot; — the Belfast Agreement is unworthy of the
                name &quot;peace agreement&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maginness also has selective amnesia
                regarding the troubles. I can list for him young men of 17, 18,
                19 and in their twenties who were murdered in his constituency.
                Mr McCaig, Mr McCaughey, Mr James Hesketh, and Mr James Macklin
                were all soldiers. One was shot on the Antrim Road, one on the
                Grosvenor Road, and two at Ligoniel. I never heard him uttering
                a word about those murders. I never heard him bring a motion
                before this House about those young men. What were they doing?
                They were defending him and his constituents. What price did
                they have to pay? They paid with their lives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He has the audacity to lecture Members on
                this side of the House about unfitness. Then we have Mr
                &quot;not fit to practise as a solicitor&quot; Attwood get up
                and support him. How dare he lecture any Member in this House
                about unfitness, and people being unfit to be in Government in
                Northern Ireland when he supports it? If they are going to start
                pointing the finger, they had better look at the three fingers
                pointing back at them. If people —</p>

                past. He may wish to read those articles. If the SDLP has set
                new standards in this debate, those standards apply to it as
                much as they apply to Guardsmen Fisher and Wright. In this
                House, we have bomb-planters, widow-makers and orphan-creators.
                There is not a word of condemnation from the SDLP about those
