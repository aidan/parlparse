    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Construction Industry Training Board</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister for Employment and Learning that he  wishes to make a statement regarding the outcome of the review of the  Construction Industry Training Board (CITB).</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker,  I will make a statement. However, before I do that, I thank you for the  flexibility that you demonstrated yesterday when we had particular pressures in  our programme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to inform the Assembly of my Department&rsquo;s  publication of a review of the Construction Industry Training Board. During an  Assembly debate on 25 February 2008, I announced that, although the next review  of CITB was due in 2009, I was bringing it forward to start in 2008. My  decision was made in acknowledgement of the serious and persistent concerns  that were expressed by the construction industry here and by political  representatives on the value for money that employers receive in return for  their levy payments. That review has concluded, and I have accepted the  recommendations and asked my officials to work together with CITB on their  implementation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The review took place in two stages. At the first stage,  the consultants were asked to address the question of whether there was a  continued need for CITB and the levy. They concluded that the CITB and the levy  were necessary interventions for the well-being of training in the construction  sector. At the second stage, the consultants identified four options: option 1,  CITB to remain unchanged; option 2, CITB to remain as a non-departmental public  body but with a rationalisation of its activities; option 3, CITB Northern  Ireland to merge with CITB-ConstructionSkills in Great Britain; option 4, CITB to be  funded with a voluntary rather than statutory levy. Those options were  assessed, and the conclusion was reached that the CITB should remain as a  non-departmental public body with rationalised activities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The review recommends that the CITB retain its  non-departmental public body status and the statutory levy; that the CITB and  ConstructionSkills &mdash; one of the sector skills councils &mdash; fully merge under one  management structure and one brand and operate from one location; and that the  levy threshold be increased from &pound;15,000 to &pound;80,000, thus exempting small  businesses from paying levy. The review also recommends that the legislation be  changed to remove air conditioning, refrigeration, plumbing, utilities and gas  installation from the scope of the levy; that the administrative burden be  reduced on employers and the CITB, with grants to be applied for by training  providers; that the CITB stop delivering direct training and contract that work  out and form strategic partnerships with centres of excellence; and that the  CITB running costs be significantly reduced so that levy payers get a greater  proportion of their contributions back via training grants or other benefits.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have introduced the necessary legislation to increase the  levy threshold to &pound;80,000. From 1 September 2009, smaller employers no longer  must pay a levy. That accounts for almost half of CITB levy payers. That is an  important measure to support small businesses, particularly in the current  economic climate. Other legislative changes will follow over the next two years  to allow for the other changes that I have outlined.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To reduce overheads, the CITB anticipates that it will  reduce its staffing level by around one third, and it is currently assessing  the skills profile required for the new organisation. Departmental officials  are working with the CITB, and they will keep the implementation of the changes  under close review. To assess the impact of the changes on the construction  sector, I anticipate another formal evaluation in the two to three years after  the report has been implemented.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The various efficiencies recommended in the report will result  in a significant year-on-year increase in the proportion of levy returned to  our construction industry. The report provides an important blueprint for the  future of the CITB, which has a crucial role to play in supporting our  construction sector during and after our recovery from the recession.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Ms S Ramsey)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his statement. Furthermore,  as the Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning, I praise the  Minister&rsquo;s willingness to bring such issues to the Committee and to the House.  I know that several Committee members will be interested in the statement, as  its subject matter has been discussed several times in Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the increase in the levy threshold from &pound;15,000  to &pound;80,000, because, as the Minister indicated in his statement, small  employers &mdash; a group that accounts for more than 50% of those who currently pay  the levy &mdash; will no longer have to pay it. With that in mind, will the Minister  outline what impact the review of the CITB will have on the quality of  construction industry apprenticeships, which, up until now, have been seen as  less than perfect? Furthermore, will he outline the rationale behind the  changes that he intends to make to the appointment of members to the CITB  board? Have any objections been raised so far?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Raising the levy threshold will remove  approximately 1,200 employers from the levy regime. As the Chairperson will  know, I have received several representations from Members who have brought  delegations to meet me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This was a continuous theme throughout. A threshold of  &pound;15,000 is very low: it effectively means one employee. We felt that that was unreasonable  and the bureaucracy unnecessary. It takes almost half of those people out of  the frame altogether, and members of the public &mdash; employers in particular &mdash;  will be happy to have it in place in the current circumstances.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member raised the issue of board members. As a  non-departmental public body, the board is appointed under OCPA guidelines.  However, it represents various sectors; some board members represent employees  and some represent employers. I have had representations in this regard, and  the principal issue that has been raised is that perhaps the small and  medium-sized enterprise sector may not have the representation that some people  think that it ought to have. It has been drawn to my attention that the larger  organisations in the construction sector may have a disproportionate influence  on events. I cannot confirm the veracity of those points, but the Member asked  me directly whether I had received any representations on the matter: I have,  and they are along the lines that I have outlined. In appointing members to the  board, I will take into account the representations that I have received. I am  not in a position to confirm the veracity of those representations, but I  certainly have received them. I suspect that the Member may also have had  similar lobbying, because people who would come to me would go to the Committee  frequently or vice versa. It may be something that we can take up together and  discuss in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked about the quality of apprentice&shy;ships, and  I will give a pen picture of where we are. As of 8 October, there were 1,629  apprentices registered in construction-related occupational areas, which  represents about 15% of the total people registered with the Department on its  funded apprenticeships. However, that is about 50% less than it was before; the  previous levels were much higher. However, as the Member knows, the  construction sector in particular has been hard hit by the downturn. We have  just over 1,600 apprentices, but that represents only 50% of what it has been  previously.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have introduced measures to try to help apprentices who  have been made redundant in the downturn, and the Member will be aware of the  Skillsafe scheme. There are defined apprenticeship frameworks for construction training  which have operated successfully for some years. I am aware that the  Construction Employers Federation, in conjunction with the Construction  Industry Training Board and the joint council, has come forward with proposals  for a revised scheme. We will consider those and respond in due course.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a particular difficulty in the industry because of  the high percentage of people who are self-employed, and that, undoubtedly,  creates an issue with apprentices. It also creates an issue with health and  safety. The CITB has a mobile unit, which will continue to operate under the  CITB&rsquo;s direction. However, it will probably buy in some training capacity.  There is no doubt that construction is one of the more difficult industries.  The rationale for retaining was that, because of the unique nature of the  industry, it was felt that if we just relied on the normal regime a lot of  people could well slip through the net and not get the proper access to the  necessary training and apprenticeships.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. Of the four options, the second, which  includes a number of recommendations, is preferred. One of those is that the  legislation be changed to remove air conditioning, refrigeration, plumbing,  utilities and gas installation from the scope of the realigned Construction  Industry Training Board (CITB). Can the Minister tell us how those training  needs will be catered for? Can he also confirm whether any companies or firms  have been identified to deliver the direct training that is normally delivered  by CITB but which is now to be contracted out?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: With regard to the latter point, those companies  have not yet been identified, but the CITB will have to contract for that  service to be provided in the normal way. I can write to the Member on the  issues, but I presume that the CITB will indicate a public requirement, so it  will be a procurement exercise in the normal fashion. The CITB will indicate  that it needs the provision of particular training and can then contract out  for it. Instead of doing it all in-house, the training provision will be  contracted out to various providers. As far as I am aware, those providers have  not, as yet, been identified, and I am not aware of any contracts having been awarded,  but that is part of the process in which we are engaged.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The removal of air conditioning, plumbing and other trades  from the scope of the CITB will bring us into line with the rest of the UK, where that  has already occurred. Training in those sectors will be provided in the same  way as training in every other sector. Construction is the only sector left  where there is a specific levy option. As the Member will know, there used to  be four or five boards with a levy power covering retailing and other sectors,  but it was felt that, in the current circumstances, the unique nature of the  construction sector meant that it was still important to have a board with a  levy power.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  Like my Committee colleagues before me, I thank the Minister for his statement.  Does he agree that it is important and timely to consider the scope of which  firms are defined as liable to pay the CITB fees?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: That issue is possibly one of the most  contentious, because a levy is a form of tax, and no company likes to be  eligible to pay a tax; therefore being in or out of scope, as it is called in  the sector, is very significant. I suspect that the Member is aware that people  have been lobbying significantly in the past on the issue of which firms should  be in scope and which should be out. There are, however, complications.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, some companies engage in some activities that are in  scope and some that are not. For example, if more than half the payroll of a  company happens to be in an activity that comes under the auspices of the CITB,  that company&rsquo;s entire wage bill is deemed to be included. Many such companies  feel that that is unfair because not all their activities are in scope yet they  are charged as if they were. I will review that issue to assess whether it  continues to be fair and reasonable and see what alternative means and  methodologies could be adopted. I am considering whether changes are required  to what is called the &ldquo;50% rule&rdquo;. I have received representations from the  Mineral Products Association in Great Britain  and have planned meetings with that organisation and with ConstructionSkills in  Great Britain,  where similar arrangements exist. We will consider that to see whether some  changes can be made to satisfy those who have made known their concerns.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. In response to a question from the Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning, the Minister referred  to the outsourcing of some of the training programmes. Will the Minister  outline the steps that his Department could take to ensure that locally based  organisations have an opportunity and will be available to conduct training on  the programmes?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Members regularly reflect that concern about  outsourcing generally and not only outsourcing that is specifically to do with  training. I am sure that most Members, at some stage, have been concerned about  that sort of issue. The Member will be aware that the Central Procurement  Directorate (CPD) of the Department of Finance and Personnel carries out  procurement exercises on behalf of all Departments. I am not sure whether the  CPD carries out procurement exercises on behalf of the CITB or whether the CITB  carries them out itself. I assume that the CPD carries them out on behalf of  the board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone is governed by European rules on procurement,  which are explicit. One cannot favour a company because of its physical  location. Some local companies may have cost advantages because they are  already here, and that should be reflected in their bid. However, the Member  will know that it is not possible to direct, to localise or to give advantage  to a local company over a company that might bid from outside Northern Ireland.  That consideration has been made regularly on all types of procurement issues,  and the law in that area is very complicated. The Department of Finance and  Personnel has the expertise, and it conducts most procurement competitions on  behalf of Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The process, however frustrating, must be followed,  because, when people feel that they have been discrim&shy;inated against, they  often take their case to court. The Member will be well aware of that;  contractual issues are still being fought over in Departments. The Department for  Employment and Learning cannot guarantee that any outsourced contracts will be  directed to local companies; it is up to a company to make the best bid. That  is the only way in which such matters can be determined, and the Member, as an  enthusiastic European, will be well aware of where the rule comes from.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  also thank the Minister for his statement. I am sure that his speedy action on  increasing the threshold for the levy to &pound;80,000 will be extremely welcome to a  number of very small employers. Will he indicate the timescale in which the  merger of the CITB and ConstructionSkills will be achieved and the likely impact  on the total number of jobs in the merged body?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: It is estimated that the CITB will reduce its  staff complement by around one third. The merger of the two bodies onto one  site is already under way, and the joint operation will be based at the current  CITB site at Nutts Corner. The bodies are looking at the new skills profiles  that will be needed so that they can assess the qualifications and the type of  personnel that they will require. That process will be settled before long. I  cannot give the Member precise timing, but, if it would be helpful to him, I  will inform him as soon as possible. The number of personnel has been reduced  by around one third, and amalgamation on the Nutts Corner site is taking place.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I join other Members in thanking the Minister for his statement. He said that  direct training will now be contracted out. Does he have any concern that, when  that training is contracted out, it will not be of the same high standard as  that which the CITB delivered? I am sure that part of the rationale for  contracting out is that it is cheaper. However, the word &ldquo;cheaper&rdquo; sometimes  raises concerns that the same level of training will not be delivered.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The Member made an important point. Throughout the  consideration period and when Members brought their delegations to me, a number  of employers made the continual criticism that they did not get the return that  they should have because the CITB&rsquo;s administration and running costs soaked up  too many of their resources. Clearly, in recent years, the pattern has been  that contracted-out services are, by and large, in most cases, more  cost-effective than those that are delivered in-house. Therefore, that balance  must be struck.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Member that my Department would not be  interested in maintaining a board if its training standards were  unsatisfactory. Indeed, it is fair to say that the Education and Training  Inspectorate has a role to play in examining the training that is provided and  reporting thereon. There must be quality control; there is no point contracting  out unsatisfactory training. Therefore, I take the Member&rsquo;s point. I assure him  that the Department would not go down that route if it thought that the level  of training was unsatisfactory. However, I am sure he accepts that we must  ensure that the minimum amount of money is taken up by administration and that  the maximum amount goes back into the sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are most concerned about the small and medium-sized enterprises,  which make up the vast majority of businesses in the sector. The Member will  know of companies in his area that are of that type and size. They are very  small companies. It is our job to ensure that the maximum amount of resource is  redirected to them. The Department believes that those companies and their  employees would not necessarily get training if that mechanism were not in  place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Member that we will keep quality under  constant review, because that will determine whether the board is working. As I  said in my statement, we will look at the situation in two or three years&rsquo; time  to ensure that it is working. I assure the Member that that will be one of my  Department&rsquo;s top priorities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. My question is about value for money, which the Minister touched on  in his previous response. Just one quarter of the survey&rsquo;s respondents believed  that the CITB offered value for money. Can the Minister reassure the House that  the review&rsquo;s recommendations will provide value for money, particularly for  those small organisations and businesses that do not believe that they received  it previously?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: That question is at the core of the matter. If the  answer to that question is no, we have wasted time and effort and must,  therefore, move on. Value for money provides the rationale for what we do. The  Department has responded to the fact that too many people were involved. We  tried to deal with that. We have cut down to 1,300 the number of companies that  will be included, compared with double that number previously.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards quality and identifying the right service to  deliver, we are trying to reduce administration costs so that as much as  possible of the levy is redistributed in training grants to various companies.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have said that we want that to go to smaller companies.  The delegations that a number of Members brought to see me continually  reflected that theme. They said that the CITB was a bit top-heavy, that its  administration costs were too high, and that it should be amalgamated with the  other body to ensure that it was more streamlined.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Only time will tell whether we have been successful;  however, we will continually monitor that. In view of that fact, I think that  the Committee broadly agreed that changes had to be made so that people feel  that they are getting value for money. Between us, we will monitor this.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If there is another review in a couple of year&rsquo;s time and  things are not satisfactory, we will have to take a different view. Value for  money is certainly at the core of the issue. That will be the determining  factor as to whether we are successful in the changes that we are proposing  today.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I, too, welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Does the Minister agree  that many construction firms, especially small ones, will welcome the increase  in the levy threshold? How will that help them on the ground to come back from  the recession?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am sure that the all those companies, of  whatever size, that will not have to pay a bill that they currently do will be  happy about that. The increase in the levy threshold will be of small  assistance to a number of small companies. There are a lot of small companies  just above that level, and they will still be covered by this. Our objective is  to try to redistribute the training resources for their benefit. The nature of  the construction industry is different; it is very difficult to track  apprentices, because people move around the country continuously. We,  therefore, felt that there needed to be a specific and unique solution to this  case. That is the rationale for retaining the board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our aim is very clear: first, to remove an unnecessary burden  from a lot of very small employers, which we are doing, and, secondly, to  ensure that those small employers that must continue to pay the levy will see  the positive impact of their contributions. Effectively, resources from the  larger levy-payers are being redistributed among some of the smaller ones. That  is what we are trying to do. The key to that will be the quality of the service  that is delivered. While we set out with a very clear aim, only the passage of  time will determine whether we succeed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The House will have an opportunity to revisit the issue. In  two to three years&rsquo; time, we will be formally monitoring and assessing whether  those changes are producing the results that we anticipate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  add my thanks to the Minister for his statement and, in particular, for  increasing the levy threshold from &pound;15,000 to &pound;80,000. However, I question whether  &pound;80,000 is such a large amount in the construction industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Minister is aware that many small  businesses in the construction industry face bills of &pound;30,000 or &pound;40,000. Is  there any hope for those businesses that have suffered setbacks such as bed debts  and other difficulties since the recession? Is there any hope of their being  able to negotiate with the CITB on the real cost of the benefits that they have  received? Many of them have received nothing. The Minister will know that some  small businesses had a very high turnover of staff because they subcontracted  out to other small businesses, and they have received no real benefit.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The Member needs to be aware that one of the  downstream consequences of the current recession is that the Construction  Industry Training Board receives its revenue on the basis of wages paid in the  previous year. The year that we are about to enter will be a very difficult  one, because last year was the year when the crash came in the construction  sector. Consequently, the levy will be reduced substantially. In a sense, that  is forcing some of the decisions that we are making, such as staff reductions  and the need to rationalise. Clearly, the percentage that people are being  charged will not change this year. No increase is being made to compensate for  the reduction in the levy. The levy was designed not to add an additional  burden, and we are trying to get as many people out of paying it as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member said that &pound;80,000 is not a lot of money, and  that is true. However, what we have done means that there is a consistent  approach between Northern Ireland  and the rest of the UK.  We will keep that under review in so far as there are inflation issues and  other issues that we need to take into account, because inflation in the  construction industry tends to be different from inflation in other sectors.  There are no plans to increase the levy to make up the shortfall in the current  year. However, there will be a substantially reduced budget produced by the  levy, not simply because of the removal of a lot of people from paying that  levy, but because it is based on the payroll of the previous year. As we know,  large numbers of people in the construction industry have been made redundant.  There will be a dramatic drop in income, but the rate at which people are being  asked to pay will not be increased.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Rates (Amendment) Bill</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Final Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Rates (Amendment) Bill [NIA 2/09] do now pass.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before providing Members with an overview of the content of  the Bill, I take the opportunity to thank Members for their support during the  passage of the Bill through the Assembly. I thank the Committee for Finance and  Personnel for considering the underpinning rating policies. I acknowledge that  we would not be where we are today had we not had such co-operation from the  Committee and the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said in previous debates on the Bill, I, along with  other Members, would have preferred that it had been possible to take the Bill  through the Assembly in the normal way and to have had a Committee Stage.  Unfortunately, to do so would have meant that the support for ratepayers, as  provided by the Bill, would not have been in place until April 2011. We did not  want to miss the deadline of the next financial year. Therefore, next April,  households and businesses will experience the changes provided for in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Chairperson, former Chairperson, and members of  the Finance and Personnel Committee, for their considered evidence taking and  their detailed scrutiny of the policies that have underpinned the Bill over  recent years. I very much hope that the productive working relationship between  my Department and the Committee will continue as the associated subordinate  legislation passes through the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have covered the detail of the Bill with Members before.  However, I think that it is worthwhile going through that again and the  advantages that the Bill will present to households and businesses across Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is an important piece of legislation, and it goes  a long way towards completing the Executive&rsquo;s review of the rating system. It  also provides strong examples of how the Executive and the Assembly are  delivering for the people of Northern Ireland and how they have listened and  responded to the concerns that people have brought to Members, the Committee  and the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will enable increased support to be given to  households and businesses at a time when they are under financial and economic  pressure. It progresses a key range of measures that aim to provide direct and  indirect assistance to a wide range of ratepayers. In the commercial sector,  the key aspects relate to the enabling power for a small business rates relief  scheme, which will also enhance rates relief for sub-post offices. It will  ensure that between &pound;8 million and &pound;9 million of help can be provided to more  than 16,000 smaller businesses each year. The Bill will also provide the  Assembly with the flexibility to decide the level at which liability for  industrial rating should be set in future years, and it will help to facilitate  the future revaluation of commercial property.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the domestic sphere, a wide range of measures, which  were agreed by the Executive and consulted on last year, are provided for.  Through subordinate legislation, the Bill will allow for the introduction of  two new energy-related schemes. The first will provide for a one-off reduction  in the rates of ratepayers who install loft or cavity wall insulation in their  homes. The second will enable full rate relief for the first occupiers of new  zero- or low-carbon homes for up to five years and two years respectively.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Importantly, the Bill also contains new data-sharing  powers, which aim to improve the take-up levels for certain reliefs. Through  those powers, we can ensure that people get the help to which they are  entitled. As Members will agree, that will be a very important measure, particularly  for pensioners and other vulnerable groups. The Bill also amends current  enabling powers, which will allow for the introduction of a rates deferment scheme  for pensioners and the rating of empty homes in due course. Although the scheme  will offer help to some pensioners, particularly during the current economic downturn,  and I want to ensure that it is effective and attracts sufficient and  manageable numbers. Having too few participants may mean that the scheme is not  worthwhile, and having too many may prove unaffordable and unsustainable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In a couple of years&rsquo; time, I want to conduct a thorough  evaluation of the scheme&rsquo;s effectiveness, which will examine how many people it  is helping and whether it represents value for money. That is part and parcel  of the policymaking process. In due course, I will update the Committee and the  Assembly on the outcome of the evaluation and take their views on board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have already said that I intend to postpone the rating of  empty homes until April 2011, and I will keep the situation under review.  However, Members may wish to note that it is not possible to introduce that  measure part way through the rating year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the domestic sector, the Bill provides for compensating  payments to be made to district councils that are affected by the reduction of  the maximum capital value to &pound;400,000. As a transition measure for that cap, it  would be neither appropriate nor financially feasible to extend the time period  that it covers beyond the two years that the Executive agreed or to extend the  compensating payments to the original cap of &pound;500,000.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are the main measures that are being taken forward in  the Bill. I look forward to Members&rsquo; support in ensuring that the Bill clears  its Final Stage: having got thus far, I hope that it does fall at that hurdle.  The debates on the Bill have been interesting. I salute those Members who  showed their dedication to the scrutiny of the Bill by being here at 12.00  midnight during its Second Stage, staying awake &mdash; I did not notice anybody  sleeping &mdash; and participating as they did.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Members for their co-operation. I emphasise again  that, although the Bill has been subject to accelerated passage, which is not  the desired procedure, there has been good co-operation. I commend the Bill to  the House.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Ms J McCann)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The Committee for Finance and Personnel considers the  Bill an important piece of legislation, not least because it includes measures  to ensure that much-needed help is delivered to businesses and households in  this difficult economic climate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The use of the accelerated passage procedure meant that the  Committee was not afforded the opportunity for in-depth scrutiny of the Bill.  However, the Committee received a detailed clause-by-clause briefing from  departmental officials at its meeting on 9 September 2009. Although there was  no formal Committee Stage, I assure the House that the Committee extensively  examined rating policies since 2007, and has engaged closely with the  Department in developing the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee undertook detailed scrutiny of the  Executive&rsquo;s review of the domestic rating system in 2007. In addition to  considering submissions to the Department&rsquo;s consultation, the Committee sought  further oral and written evidence from the Department and a number of  stakeholders. The Committee made 33 recommendations in the report on its  response to the Executive&rsquo;s review, which was published in November 2007.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee subsequently received several oral and  written briefings from departmental officials, including briefings on the  outcome of consultations that were undertaken on high-level rating policy  changes. I wish to put on record the Committee&rsquo;s appreciation to the officials  in the Department of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s (DFP) rating policy division for  the level of assistance that they provided to the Committee during the  important policy-development stages of the reforms. Their approach provides a  model of good practice for departmental engagement with Committees.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is pleased to note that some of the  recommendations from its 2007 report have already been moved forward in advance  of the Bill, such as those relating to the lone pensioner discount, and  education and training rate relief. Other recommendations highlighted in the  report are provided for in the Bill, including green rebates for environmental  measures, a deferred payment scheme for pensioners, measures to improve the  uptake of rates relief, and the introduction of the rating of vacant domestic  properties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I said during the Second Stage debate that the Committee  was, at that time, considering the Minister&rsquo;s proposal to postpone the  introduction of the rating of empty domestic properties. At its meeting on 23  September 2009, the Committee recognised that the current economic climate was  not conducive to the early introduction of that measure. Given the potential  revenue that has been forgone as a result of that delay, the Committee  recommends that, in 2010, the Department review its position on the timing of  the introduction of the rating of empty homes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill makes provision for aspects of non-domestic rating  policy, which have also been scrutinised by the Committee. In April 2008, the  Committee called on the Minister not to rule out a relief scheme for small  businesses, considering the importance of the small-business sector to the  local economy. The Committee welcomes the inclusion of a small business rates  relief scheme in the Bill, which includes enhanced relief for post offices, and  notes the provisions regarding industrial derating, whereby the percentage  liability will be set from 1 April 2011 by means of an Order subject to  affirmative resolution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I highlighted the Committee&rsquo;s appreciation of departmental  officials&rsquo; assistance during the policy-development stages of the rating  reforms. On a less positive note, in respect of the recent legislative stages,  Committee members were disappointed that they did not have time to consider  ministerial amendments in advance of them being tabled at Consideration Stage,  especially as the nature of the amendments suggests that the Department should  have been aware of their necessity earlier in the legislative process. The  Committee wrote to the Department to express its concern, and the implications  that that may have when DFP seeks to use the accelerated passage procedure for  future Bills.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At its meeting tomorrow, the Committee will consider a  response on that issue from DFP, which offers an explanation and an assurance  that, for any future legislation, the Department will ensure that the Committee  is notified at the earliest possible opportunity when DFP envisages that  amendments may have to be tabled after Second Stage. That response is welcome.  Nonetheless, it is important to put down a marker, especially in the context of  accelerated passage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill contains enabling and delegated powers by which  subordinate legislation will be introduced to implement the detail of the  various measures and schemes. My Committee will play an important role in  scrutinising the forthcoming statutory rules, and I ask the Minister to ensure  that we are given sufficient time to carry out that role effectively. On behalf  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel, I formally support the Bill at its  Final Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make one comment from a party perspective. I am  glad that the Minister said earlier that he will keep the rating of empty homes  under review. I want to emphasise to the Minister the importance of keeping  that matter under review. In light of the huge need for housing, we should  ensure that no one could use the system to prevent people from accessing  much-needed housing.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  support the Bill at its Final Stage. It is important that the legislation be  passed so that its provisions are in place and implemented by April 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill contains several measures, including reliefs,  which are desirable. It is important that people benefit from those. As I have  said in the House previously, a rating system is, essentially, an unfair  system. It is a property tax, and, as such, it is only loosely correlated to a  person&rsquo;s ability to pay. Any taxation should be related to ability to pay. That  brings about a need for reliefs in the rating system to ameliorate, to some  degree, the existing unfairness. A balance needs to be struck between issues  such as the loss of revenue and the need to create a system that is not overly  complex. The preceding discussions between the Department and the Committee  have resulted in a fair scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the various measures. The small business rates  relief scheme will provide useful benefits to small businesses, particularly  post offices. I support the measures that will encourage energy efficiency,  particularly through zero-carbon and low-carbon homes, and I welcome the  measures on rate deferment. I support the provision to rate empty homes, and I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments about postponing that measure for next year and  reviewing the situation thereafter. That is exactly the right stance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the rating of vacant non-domestic properties is  not relevant to the Bill, I have raised the issue previously. I am glad that  the Minister has taken my comments on board during his evaluation. I support  the measure that will provide temporary reimbursement to councils for the  revenue that they lost because of the rate cap. I note the Minister&rsquo;s comments  about evaluating that measure in two years&rsquo; time; that is sound. For example, a  measure was created recently to provide a relief for students; it simply did  not work, and we have, sensibly, decided to phase it out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to achieve a balance, and we should not  keep changing the system all the time. People must become familiar with the  reliefs, because such knowledge impacts on the uptake of reliefs. If we change  the scheme all the time, it will more difficult for people to get used to the  available reliefs. Nonetheless, a sensible review is the right way forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Despite the fact that we were discussing the Bill at approaching midnight  several weeks ago, it is fair to say that the Minister would never put anyone to  sleep. We can accuse him of many things but being boring is not one of them,  even at that late hour.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party is happy to support the Final Stage of  this important legislation. However, given that this is a legislative Assembly  and that this is important legislation, I am somewhat disappointed that the  debate is petering out. However, that is another matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is the culmination of a process that has been  under way for several years. It began when Brian Wilson and I proposed a review  of the rating system in a private Members&rsquo; motion in June 2007, which was  followed by several consultations on various aspects of rating. The Bill is a  major piece of legislation that will be in place for several years, and it may  be some time before we return to the subject in the same depth.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The process has been a strange one; there has been a leisurely  approach to the consultation over the years, but because of the circumstance  surrounding the Executive, we had to use accelerated passage to ensure that we  met the commencement dates. The Second Stage was debated extremely late at  night, and we are debating the Final Stage in a leisurely fashion because other  business is set to collapse.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make some specific points, largely about how the  legislation fits into a wider policy context. First, I will pick up on Declan  O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s point about rates not being the fairest approach because property is,  perhaps, a blunt measurement of someone&rsquo;s ability to pay. During the debate on  the Second Stage of the Bill, I made a point about the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  preference for a local income tax as a better way of doing things. At that time  I was not seeking to open up a wider debate; I was just making a simple point.  Nevertheless, the Minister engaged with me, as is his usual way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister pointed out the difficulties of introducing a  local income tax and gave the example of the Scottish Parliament, which  considered the idea but moved away from it. It is worth noting that those  assumptions may not apply in Northern Ireland  to the extent that they do in Scotland.  We have two opportunities to introduce a local income tax in a more  cost-effective way. First, it may be easier to achieve if we were talking about  such a tax only as a replacement for the regional rate. Secondly, we have,  perhaps, a unique advantage in that all of Northern Ireland is covered by BT  postcodes, which may make it easier for Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs&rsquo;  computers to work things out. Those are points for the record, but I accept  that, in many respects, they are moot points now, as the issue has been settled  for some years to come. Perhaps we will come back to it in future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth pointing out that if the Executive are forced  into considering water charges soon, any such charges will be based on property  values in the same way that rates are based on property values. The issue of  fairness is one that the Assembly cannot fully escape.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are other aspects of the Bill to consider. I am  sceptical about the small business relief scheme, but I am prepared to give it  a cautious endorsement. I am not overwhelmed by the economic arguments for that  scheme, to which a significant deadweight is attached. However, there are  social benefits, which, perhaps, tip the balance in the scheme&rsquo;s favour. My  difficulty is that such a scheme is another example of a response to the  economic downturn and the problems faced by business whereby the Executive have  addressed, essentially, the cost base that is confronted by businesses. We did  something similar for households when we froze the regional rate and deferred  water charges. We have also considered industrial rating for businesses and how  to keep it down. In themselves, such measures may be justifiable; they may help  businesses through difficult times and allow the economy to keep moving by  demand. However, they do not give us an opportunity to change the way in which  business operates in Northern    Ireland, nor do they allow us to tackle the  underlying structural problems in our economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When we come out of recession, those same underlying problems  will remain. In some respects, the lost revenue from schemes such as small  business rate relief could be more efficiently used in other ways to assist  businesses and change the underlying dynamics of our economy in order to allow  us to become a more competitive region. I am slightly cautious about the  potential wisdom of those measures and the impact that they may have.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At Second Stage, the Minister came close to acknowledging  that there is a challenge to the Executive to try to use its economic tools to  rebalance our economy. He said that that had to happen and that the priority  had to be to address the cost pressures. We disagree: we think that both can be  done together. Measures to rebalance the economy will help us out of recession.  We have a difference of opinion on that approach.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the proposals that have been made on energy  efficiency and low- and zero-carbon homes. I am encouraged by the flexibility  in the legislation to allow the schemes to be extended if they prove successful.  However, I regard those schemes as necessary but not sufficient &mdash; not just on  DFP&rsquo;s part but on that of other Departments &mdash; to address the challenge of  energy efficiency and climate change. Leaving aside the causes of climate change,  we would all agree that there is an economic rationale for trying to change our  approach to the management of energy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment has an  important role in renewable energy, energy policies and the associated costs in  Northern Ireland, which are a major competitive disadvantage for businesses.  The Department of the Environment has a similar role in planning, and the  Department for Social Development has one in housing. It is important to stress  that energy efficiency in homes and businesses should be examined from two  viewpoints: taxation or rates, to provide financial incentives for people to go  down that road, and regulation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to clarify where we stand in respect of  building regulations. The Assembly legislated on building regulations in March  of this year, and the expectation was that the Department would issue  regulations on energy efficiency. There is a concern that we are not moving as  quickly as other jurisdictions, particularly towards the 2016 target for low-  and zero-carbon homes. That is part of a wider package in which we need to use  the ratings system and buildings regulations to reach that objective.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister conceded at Second Stage that we have not done  the modelling to work out how far any individual aspect of policy will get us  towards the targets for how we shift our energy usage. Will the Minister  clarify whether households would be entitled to rate relief on low- and  zero-homes on an individual or group basis?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Microgeneration could be introduced to a single household  via a turbine linked to an individual house. However, it is conceivable that a  developer could build a new housing development in which a single set of  turbines would power all the households on that estate. Those households may  not be low- or zero-carbon homes on a free-standing basis, but they would be,  in practice, if they were linked into the network of that development. Will the  Minister clarify whether households would be eligible for assistance in those  circumstances?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, will the implementation of the system create  significant pressures on Land and Property Services? Members have expressed  concerns about the situation in that organisation, and I appreciate that LPS  has done a lot of good work in recent months to turn things around. There is an  impression that Land and Property Services is under-resourced. I appreciate  that we face a range of financial pressures, but it is noticeable that that  body makes a bid in every monitoring round and that those bids seem to be  increasing. Indeed, in the last monitoring round, Land and Property Services  bid for &pound;5 million, which represents a considerable uplift on its baseline  figure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister comment on the underlying funding of Land  and Property Services and on whether there is a problem to which the Assembly  and the Executive need to return? We are happy to support the Final Stage with  the caveats that I outlined about what the Executive need to do in a wider  context.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank all the Members who participated in the  debate. One of the pleasing things has been that Members have had to strain to  find criticisms of me. That is not normal for Members. I wrote down the number  of times that even Mr O&rsquo;Loan the Member for North Antrim  said that he agreed with me, and I will keep that as a useful record. I do not  think that he will say it that often, but I will endeavour to ensure that he  does. I will respond to Members&rsquo; points. We covered many of the same issues at  the Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage, at its Consideration Stage and again today at its  Final Stage. However, one can always be sure that Dr Farry will come up with  something that has not been raised before and which had not been anticipated &mdash;  that is part of the legislative process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson noted the assistance that was given by  officials. I, too, thank the officials for the policy work that was required  for the Rates (Amendment) Bill and for their work on the Bill itself. In an age  of cynicism, when people who work in the Civil Service are often referred to as  faceless, uncaring and inhuman bureaucrats, it is nice that faces can be  attached to the names of Department of Finance and Personnel officials. They  appear regularly before the Committee, and they are responsive to Members&rsquo;  concerns and try to provide answers to their questions. I thank the officials  for the support and help that they have given to me. I assure members of the  Committee for Finance and Personnel that their interfacing with officials and  the work that officials have done on the legislation will characterise future  work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson raised the issue of empty homes and  welcomed the fact that we will review the situation again in 2011; she noted  that revenue would be lost by not proceeding with the scheme, and she is right.  However, I assure the Chairperson that work on the database of empty homes  continues. The work that Building Control is doing along with Land and Property  Services in seeking to identify empty homes in Belfast led to the identification of a large  number of homes that were occupied but on which rates were not being paid. I  have had briefings from Building Control and was informed that about &pound;4&middot;2  million worth of rateable value was identified during that process. Therefore,  although we are forgoing revenue, work is ongoing. I want to encourage Building  Control and LPS to work together right across Northern Ireland to continue their  work, which may identify available revenue streams that we are not tapping  into.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson also mentioned the amendments and the late  notification of those amendments. I gave an explanation for that at  Consideration Stage. The Chairperson is quite right that the amendments, which  were technical, were identified at an early stage, but they could not be brought  forward earlier because they were identified after the Bill had received  Executive approval. Had we amended the Bill before its Second Stage, it would  have had to go through the approval process again, and that would have caused  delay. It took long enough to get the Bill through the Executive in the first  place, without putting an amended Bill through, especially as the amendments  were only technical. Therefore, as per the protocol of the House, the  amendments could not be published until the Bill had had its Second Stage. The  Committee was notified of the amendments as quickly as possible after that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have written to the Chairperson and the Committee  outlining in great detail the procedures and constraints under which we were  operating, and I hope that that is acceptable. I hope that accelerated passage  is not going to be the order of the day in the future anyhow, but the one thing  that I will give a commitment on is that, where departmental or ministerial  amendments are being made to Bills, we will try to give notification of that as  quickly as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to Mr O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s remarks. As I have said, I welcome  the fact that he agreed with me on so many issues in relation to the Bill. He  is quite right that policies need to be evaluated constantly. There is no point  in simply doing things because that is what we did two or three years ago or  even further back. Very often, some of the things that we choose to do are done  in response to particular situations, and, as those situations change, it is  good policy to evaluate the measures that we have undertaken to see whether  they are effective or still needed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan made the important point that changing the system  is not painless. First, especially when it comes to a policy such as this one,  which is being implemented in the Bill, people have to get used to that policy  and the measures involved. Constantly chopping and changing creates  uncertainty. The other point that I will make to the Assembly is that very  often Members are encouraged to respond to a changing situation, and we think  that it is simply a case of clicking our fingers and things happen. However,  they do not happen that easily; all changes involve a cost. I know that Dr  Farry raised the issue of the resourcing of the LPS, and I will come to that in  a moment or two. Every time we change the rating system, changes have to be  made to items such as the IT systems and forms etc that are used by the LPS. In  addition, the LPS staff must undergo training, and that comes at a cost. That  is one of the reasons why, now that we have nearly completed the Executive  review of the rating system, I hope that there will be stability for a number  of years, so that we can reap the benefits from the changes on which we have  spent money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry started by saying that he feared that the debate  was petering out. However, through his contribution, he single-handedly tried  to ensure that the debate did not peter out and that a number of issues would  be raised. His first point was that any policy change involves a process. This  is particularly important, because some commentators expect the Assembly to be  able to wave a magic wand. That process, because of the constraints on us to  consult and to test the policy before incorporating it into a draft Bill, takes  a fairly long time. There are those who think that there are instant answers.  However, if we were to take short cuts on the consultation or other steps in  the process, they would be the first to shout about it. Dr Farry brought an air  of realism to the debate on how long it will take to implement the identified  changes.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will not debate with Dr Farry or with Mr O&rsquo;Loan, who also  raised the issue, on whether rates are the fairest way of raising taxation,  other than to repeat the point that I made at Second Stage. I am not sure  whether Dr Farry is an economist, but he speaks like one at times: &ldquo;On the one  hand, this and, on the other hand, something else&rdquo;. As an economist, he will  know of Adam Smith&rsquo;s canons of taxation, one of which is that efficient  collection is a characteristic of any good tax system. As I pointed out in an  earlier debate, local income tax would not be an inexpensive way to raise  money. I noted Dr Farry&rsquo;s point about applying it only to the regional rate.  However, the same work would have to be done to apply it to the regional rate  as to the district rate. I am not sure whether being covered by BT postcodes  would reduce the cost of collection, because people&rsquo;s ability to pay would  still have to be assessed. As is often the case with economics, it is a dry  debate, because we have moved on, and we have decided on the system that we  will use.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: We  will declare a ceasefire on that for now.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: We will, but I am sure that we will return to it at  some stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry also raised the issue of business rates relief, with  which he disagrees. I know that the issue is popular with the Federation of  Small Businesses, the Northern Ireland Independent Retail Trade Association  (NIIRTA) and many others, yet Dr Farry is prepared to stick his head above the  parapet and question whether it is the most effective way of spending public  money; and I admire him for that. It is a response both to small businesses  saying that they are under pressure and to the current economic situation, and  it is, therefore, an appropriate way of spending money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not view business rates relief as an alternative to  the longer-term structural change in the supply side that is required to grow  the economy, and I hope that I did not give the impression in earlier debates.  If one considers the Executive&rsquo;s record, one will see that they do not regard  business rates relief as an alternative option but as something that goes along  with the longer-term structural measures that the Executive are undertaking on  infrastructure, training, encouraging an enterprise culture, improving the  infrastructure to help small businesses to start up in business parks and so  forth.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Work on all those measures is being done at the same time.  I do not, therefore, want to give the impression that the Executive are  concentrating on short-term measures and ignoring longer-term measures. Dr  Farry is right that, if we are to go down the road of changing the structure of  the economy, there are much more fundamental issues that need to be dealt with  than the short-term Elastoplast, as it could be described, of business rates  relief.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry raised several points about energy efficiency. I  am glad that he did not make one particular point, because it could have led to  a long debate. He did not try to attribute climate change to any one particular  cause. That is also a debate for another day.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is correct: the important point is that it is  good policy to look at how we can save energy and make our homes more  energy-efficient. That is good for individuals because it reduces their bills  at a time when, ironically, because of the response to climate change, they  will face increased costs. The other day, the Utility Regulator talked about an  increase of anything up to 60% in electricity bills because of the fixation  with reducing CO2 emissions. People will find that energy is more expensive in  the future, so it makes sense to save it. Since there is only a finite supply  of many of our energy resources, it makes sense to use them wisely. Our  measures are designed to do just that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As far as progress on the building regulations is concerned,  I do not have that information today. However, I will write to Dr Farry about  that because the issue that he raised is important. He also mentioned rates  relief for low-carbon or zero-carbon homes. I think that it makes sense to do  that in some kind of linked way. We will address how the issue that he raised  will be dealt with when it comes to the formal definition of zero-carbon homes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that I have gone through most of the points that  Members raised, and I thank everyone for the work that they have done.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. This is not a debate. The Minister has not moved the Consideration Stage  of the Bill. That is a matter for the Minister and the Executive. However, I  was notified by the Minister of her intention not to move the Consideration  Stage of the Bill. Party Whips were informed, and a letter from the Minister  was put into Members&rsquo; pigeonholes. Let us not have a debate: the Consideration  Stage of the Education Bill has not been moved.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Public Expenditure 2009-2010: &nbsp;September Monitoring</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of Finance and Personnel  that he wishes to make a statement regarding the public expenditure 2009-2010  September monitoring round.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: Following the Executive meeting this  morning, I would like to make a statement regarding the outcome of the  September monitoring round, so this is hot off the press.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second monitoring round of 2009-2010 has the role and  purpose, under the in-year monitoring process, of allowing the Executive to  make optimal use of resources at our disposal by reviewing departmental expenditure  plans in light of the most recent information available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my statement to the Assembly in July on the June  monitoring round, I informed Members of the record levels of investment in the  public services that were delivered by the Executive in 2008-09, and the fact  that that was at least partly due to the considerable reductions in levels of  underspending compared to previous years. However, I also indicated in that  statement that the improved spending performance of Departments last year had  implications for the management of the expenditure position going forward. I  particularly highlighted the need to reduce our use of overcommitment as a tool  for managing public expenditure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The simple reality is that if, unlike under previous direct  rule Administrations, Departments now spend the vast majority of money  available to them, the return of significant funds to the Executive during the  year or large year-end underspends cannot be anticipated. That point sets the  important context for the September monitoring round, in which the key  challenge for the Executive was managing the overall financial position to  protect our own integrity, and that of the Northern Ireland block, by ensuring  that we do not overspend against the amounts available to us, while supporting  priority areas in which additional funding is needed. In anticipation that some  Members may try to portray such a position as a self-inflicted wound, let me  say that the contrary is true: it is a consequence of an Executive who deliver  for the people of Northern Ireland on levels of spend, on sound financial  management and on responsive public services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to the detail, the level of reduced require&shy;ments  declared by Departments in the September monitoring round was &pound;26&middot;8 million in  current expenditure and &pound;21&middot;1 million in capital investment. Further details  are set out in tables attached to my published statement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To underpin my point about better financial performance,  reduced requirements this year total only 57&middot;7% of the amount declared at the  same stage last year. I emphasise the significance of that position; it means  that the amounts allocated to Departments in the last Budget are being used by  those Departments for the purposes intended, rather than being returned for  redistribution. They are meeting the purposes proposed by the Executive and  endorsed by the Assembly following an extensive public consultation process &mdash;  yet more evidence of a successful delivery against the considered needs of the  people of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, as a consequence of that performance, and of the  overcommittment that existed at the end of the June monitoring round, no funds  are freely available for allocation to Departments at present. Some in the  House may seek to paint that situation as unduly problematic, but in reality  the position highlights our progress in delivering the commitments set out in  the Programme for Government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In order to facilitate further sound financial manage&shy;ment  in Departments, the Executive have allowed Departments to move resources across  spending areas when the movement reflects a proactive management decision that  is taken to enable the relevant Department to manage emerging pressures within  its existing baselines. Those Departments are to be commended for their actions  to address pressures in that way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It has also been necessary, largely due to technical issues,  to reclassify some amounts between expenditure categories. Details of those  changes are provided in the tables that are attached to the statement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although no amounts were available for reallocation to  address departmental pressures, the Executive have agreed small allocations of  &pound;0&middot;1 million current expenditure to the Northern Ireland Assembly and the  Northern Ireland Audit Office. Those allocations reflect the bodies&rsquo; unique  circumstances and the fact that their costs are agreed by their respective  Committees, as opposed to being subject to the normal scrutiny and challenge  that apply to other Departments. That said, and acknowledging that the amounts  involved are small, I urge the House and the Northern Ireland Audit Office to  recognise the financial constraints and to do all in their power to minimise  their call on the wider public expenditure position. Those institutions, more  than any others, must lead by example.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When viewed in light of the lower level of reduced  requirements and the amount of end-year underspend in 2008-09, those charges  have resulted in a reduction in the total overcommitment to a prudent level for  this stage of the financial year. However, the balance between current and  capital overcommitment is slightly skewed, with current expenditure being ahead  of target, while capital investment is behind target. Therefore, to redress the  imbalance, the Executive have agreed to reclassify &pound;22&middot;5 million of current  expenditure as capital investment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That reclassification brings the overcommitment position to  &pound;45&middot;8 million for current expenditure and &pound;20 million for capital investment,  which, based on departmental spending performance in 2008-09, represents the  maximum level of overcommitment for this stage of the financial year, with no  scope to increase that amount to meet any pressures at this time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Three issues were identified as being of sufficient  strategic importance to warrant action by the Executive at this time: the &pound;20  million first call on available money for the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS), which was agreed by the Executive as part  of the last Budget; the costs of addressing emerging pressures that are linked  to swine flu, which, again, is a health issue; and the Bombardier CSeries  project in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Turning first to the &pound;20 million first call on the  available resources for DHSSPS, as Members will recognise, the constrained  financial position that we face means that, at this time, there are no  available resources to allocate against that commitment. However, the Minister  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has helpfully offered to release  &pound;10 million capital investment through proactive management of his significant  investment programme, which, through some flexibility that is available to the  Executive, can now be reclassified as current expenditure and returned to his  Department as a first instalment against the &pound;20 million. With respect to the  balance, the Executive have agreed that making good on that commitment will be  a priority for the remaining two monitoring rounds this year, when all  reasonable efforts will be made to find the remaining &pound;10 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At this stage, swine flu costs are still estimates, and the  Health Minister has identified likely minimum requirements of &pound;42&middot;6 million  current expenditure and &pound;22 million capital investment. Those amounts may be  subject to change; however, the Executive have agreed to move forward on that  basis. Taking account of the amounts that are available in the existing DHSSPS  budget, a net pressure of &pound;27&middot;9 million current expenditure and &pound;11&middot;5 million  capital investment remains to be addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, with respect to the Bombardier C series project,  DETI has identified a net capital investment pressure of &pound;22&middot;3 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I should explain that this &pound;500 million investment &mdash; the  largest ever inward investment project secured for Northern Ireland &mdash; is expected to  create more than 800 new jobs over its production cycle, with many more jobs  forecast to be created indirectly at peak employment. The supply-chain benefits  for the UK, and for Northern Ireland  in particular, are substantial. The investment will help to safeguard and  further develop high-quality manufacturing skills in Northern Ireland for many years to  come. That highlights the importance of the issue as a project in its own right  and as evidence of the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to make economic growth their  number-one priority.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In dealing with those two strategic issues, the Executive  have agreed that, despite the constrained financial position, they are of such  significance that support must be made available to the two Departments  concerned. That will come from two sources. The Executive have agreed that  Barnett consequentials that were received in the Chancellor&rsquo;s 2009 Budget  amounting to &pound;23&middot;8 million will be used, first, to cover the CSeries project,  with the balance set against the residual swine-flu capital costs. Before that,  the Executive had intended using that funding to offset the additional  efficiency reduction of &pound;122&middot;8 million, which will apply next year. However,  given the financial position and the importance of the two issues, the  consequences of the efficiencies will be addressed as part of wider work on the  2010-11 position. The Executive will consider that at their next meeting, and I  will make a statement on that issue to the Assembly in due course.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the balance of the swine flu pressure, the &pound;27&middot;9  million current expenditure and &pound;10 million capital investment, the Executive  have unanimously agreed that it will be funded by way of a pro-rata  contribution from all other Departments. A table showing the total contribution  by Departments is attached to that statement. However, I will continue to press  the case with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury that the UK Government should contribute  to those costs, and robust monitoring systems will be put in place so that any  funding not required for swine flu will be returned to Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We should not underestimate the significance of this. At a  time when all departmental budgets are under significant pressure, the  Executive have acted decisively and in the broader strategic interests of Northern Ireland,  setting narrow departmental interests to one side. Those were difficult  decisions for Ministers and there was much debate about them. However, it is  important to recognise that those adjustments do not mean a reduction in  overall expenditure levels; they simply represent a reprioritisation &mdash; I wish  the civil servants would not use those big words in my speeches &mdash; of the funds  available to the Executive as others have suggested, but without the need for a  formal and time-consuming bureaucratic Budget process. The corporate approach  taken by the Executive has enabled those strategic pressures to be addressed  while ensuring that the overcommitment remains at a prudent level for this  stage in the financial year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the overall financial position means that it was  not possible to address all the pressures identified in the September  monitoring round, our prudent and responsible approach means that the pressures  of strategic significance have been addressed, while the integrity of the Northern Ireland  block has been maintained. That emphasises the importance of having a local and  fully functioning Executive and delivery by the people of Northern Ireland for the people of Northern Ireland.  For that reason, I commend the September monitoring position to the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: There is a long list of Members who want to ask questions. If  Members ask questions and keep them precise, everyone will get their turn; if  they make statements, not everyone will be accommodated. If a Member makes a  statement, I will move on to the next Member.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann  (Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and I particularly  welcome the fact that top-slicing by Departments did not have to happen in the  case of the Bombardier CSeries. In view of the importance of economic  investment, I ask the Minister whether he agrees that it should be distributed  equitably to balance regional development across the North.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I welcome the Chairperson&rsquo;s support of the  monitoring statement and the way in which we have decided to allocate money. We  were mindful, especially when looking for the CSeries money, of the impact of  top-slicing across Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the Member&rsquo;s point; indeed, if one looks at  the Executive investment portfolio at present, it is quite clear that we seek  to dispense the benefits of public spending across the whole of Northern Ireland.  This morning, I was interviewed about some of the views that I expressed on the  Bain report &mdash; I suspect that that is what the Member was alluding to. When I  was questioned on the situation in the north-west, I was able to point out  that, in recent months, the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and  the Minister for Employment and Learning have introduced measures there to help  those who have found themselves unemployed to reskill and retrain. The Ilex  programme has received &pound;18 million, which will open up the huge Ebrington site  in Londonderry and which represents substantial  investment and urban regeneration for the city. New schools are also being  built in the city.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That picture is replicated all over Northern Ireland.  The &pound;10 billion that the Executive dispense across Northern Ireland is spent on a wide  range of projects. Indeed, one of the things that I have done as Minister of  Finance and Personnel is to go to see some of those projects in the west,  south, north and north-west of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. I particularly welcome the fact that we  are now seeing Departments spending their allocation, which contrasts with the  situation a number of years ago in which there were large amounts of underspend  and the resources were not being used efficiently.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My question follows on from the Chairperson&rsquo;s question and  is about the money that has been allocated to DETI on the CSeries. First,  people may wonder why that money was not allocated earlier, as part of the DETI  budget. Were there any particular restrictions that meant that that could not  happen? Secondly, what are the implications for the economy of the allocation  of money to the CSeries?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: There was a lot of negotiation with the Treasury and  Bombardier about the CSeries, and that was not finalised until after the  current comprehensive spending review (CSR) period had started. Therefore, not  being certain that the money would be spent, the Minister put the money back  into the pot, with the understanding that, should the CSeries go ahead, the contractual  obligation &mdash; it is a contractual obligation &mdash; would be met. The Executive have  honoured that contractual obligation. That explains why the allocation was not  in the budget of the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment. Having said that, the allocation to the Department is not  100% of the funding; the Minister had to find the first &pound;10 million and the  remainder was made up from the reallocation in the monitoring round.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have emphasised the importance of investing in the  CSeries project already. At more than &pound;500 million, it is the largest amount of  money for a single inward investment project in Northern Ireland. I do not know a  great deal about the technology, but it will put Northern Ireland at the leading  edge of carbon fibre technology. Obviously, there are spin-off effects from  that. It will generate 800 high quality, well paid, highly skilled jobs.  Indeed, if the jobs that will be maintained in Bombardier as a result of the  project and supply chain jobs are included, the total number of jobs over the  eight years of the investment is probably more than 2,400. Obviously, it is a  very important project, and we had a contractual obligation. We have sent out  the right signal that we are not simply saying in words that the economy is the  priority but are showing it in our deeds.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  It is clear that the Minister&rsquo;s inheritance is creating a struggle for him. In  the circumstances, I welcome what he is doing for the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety and for the Bombardier CSeries project.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Minister says that no funds are available for  allocation. That is a sweeping generalisation. Is it not an admission that  DFP&rsquo;s number crunching is crashing down around it, necessitating the Minister  to make a full statement with bare facts, warts and all? Will he confirm  whether the &pound;380 million shortfall will be the top figure, or whether it will  escalate to &pound;480 million or &pound;580 million? Where does the Minister stand? Does  he know where he stands?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I anticipated that I might get such a question from  the Member; in fact, I would have been disappointed had he not asked me a  question along those lines. Let us look at what I, as Finance Minister, have  inherited. This year, public expenditure in Northern Ireland is the highest  that it has ever been; investment and capital investment are the highest that  they have ever been; and Departments, which are spending to their programmes,  are doing what they said that they intended to do. I am pleased to have  inherited that legacy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said in my statement, to some extent, those  developments cause some pressures. In the past, when lots of money that was  supposed to be spent was not spent, Departments declared reduced requirements,  enabling any pressures that came along to be met. That is no longer possible,  or, at least, it is not as easy as it was in the past. However, we should be  pleased, not unhappy, about that. Even having done that, we were able to find  in the September monitoring round the money for the two fairly significant  pressures that I discussed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members that we were able to find the &pound;200 million  for the deferred water charges and additional money for housing in the June  monitoring round. So much for the figures being in disarray and there being  some panic. Although difficult decisions will have to be made, it is unfair of  the Member to say that I have inherited some kind of crumbling financial legacy  that is difficult to manage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member was correct to say that the Assembly is entitled  to an explanation as to how we intend to go forward in the next financial year;  indeed, I think that I made that point in my statement. Will &pound;370 million be  the total pressure? If it is not, how much will it be? How do we intend to  address it? I made clear in my statement that once the Executive have had an  opportunity to consider the paper on that matter, I will make a statement to  the Assembly so that Members can ask me difficult questions about it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  note what the Minister says about the dramatic reduction in reduced  requirements. That calls fundamentally into question the use of monitoring  rounds as a mechanism for addressing financial pressures, and it is leading to  activity that has all the hallmarks of crisis management. Does he agree that,  in the medium term, a better method of managing our public finances must be put  in place? The mechanism for dealing with swine flu is to top-slice from all  Departments, and I am surprised at the Minister&rsquo;s defence of that method.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to come to a question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  am surprised that the Minister offers that as the only solution. Does he agree  that the use of an Ad Hoc Committee to reprioritise the Budget, which I have  recommended here before, would be the best way forward in the short term?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Reprioritising the Budget would not have made a  blind bit of difference to the situation that we face. Swine flu could not have  been anticipated in a debate or in a reprioritisation of the Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A reprioritisation of the Budget implies planning ahead in  a different way from before, but those plans must still be made on the basis of  certainties. When unanticipated factors arise, other mechanisms must be found  to deal with them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member criticised the use of monitoring rounds.  However, there are only two other mechanisms for allocating funds from the  block grant. At the very beginning of the process, the Member&rsquo;s party and  others supported having an even greater overcommitment; that would have been  far more dangerous and have led to crisis management. We would have found no  money forthcoming to write off the overcommitment, which would have led to  dramatic changes in the last two or three months of the financial year. That  would have created a real crisis; therefore it was not an option.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other option was a contingency fund. However, Members  must recognise that if we &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I note that Mr McNarry made a comment from a  sedentary position, advising me to create a contingency fund, and that the  creation of such a fund was his party&rsquo;s idea. It was not his party&rsquo;s idea; his  party&rsquo;s idea was to have an even bigger overcommitment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must be clear what establishing a contingency fund would  mean. Money would be taken from Departments now and placed into a pot to deal  with an emergency that might happen during the year. The contingency fund would  have to be retained until the end of the financial year, and if an emergency  did not occur, a scramble would take place to spend the money. That is not good  financial management.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Whatever the option taken, it will have its disadvantages.  However, I am coming to the same conclusion as Mr O&rsquo;Loan: if little money is  released through monitoring rounds, perhaps they are not the way forward and we  should perhaps examine another mechanism for reallocating funds. That would  probably mean creating a contingency fund; however, that option is not necessarily  pain free, and neither would it mean that Departments would not lose money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan also mentioned the top-slicing of Departments&rsquo;  budgets to pay for swine flu. That was the only option that was available to  the Executive for the release of those funds, after the examination of other  areas from which money could be reallocated. The top-slicing arrangement is  something from which many Departments benefitted in the past, and it was the  only fair way of finding the money for swine flu. However, as the Member  suggested, when it comes to longer-term planning we must examine the targeting  of non-priorities and not fund those areas.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  welcome the September monitoring round, albeit in the middle of October.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister clarify the position with respect to the  use of the Barnett consequentials for the CSeries project at Bombardier and  what is happening to the balance of that fund? Northern Ireland received &pound;116  million over two years for that project. Furthermore, does the Minister  recognise that the source of those funds was an economic uplift at a UK level in the  form of an economic stimulus? Moreover, surely the example of what the  Executive are doing in supporting Bombardier demonstrates that they should be  doing more to use resources to support the economy. The point that I would make  about &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has asked a question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  OK. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member asked a question early in his  contribution and went on to ask several more. However, that is not unlike the  Member; he is well known for getting good value when making contributions in  the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is correct: only one side of the Barnett  consequential money that the Executive pushed to next year was used, and that  was the capital side.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is &pound;26&middot;5 million for current spending, which will be  available to relieve pressures next year unless a decision is made this year to  bring it forward into the current spending period.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the purpose for which the Barnett  consequentials were used, the whole point of devolution is that Westminster will not tell  us how to spend that money. There is a mechanism through which we get our share  of money that Westminster  spends on items that are included in the Barnett consequentials. That money is  not ring-fenced or hypothecated; it is simply available to us, and we decide  how we wish to spend it. The Assembly has decided its spending priorities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the Member looks at what we have done with capital  expenditure, he will see that we have spent it in exactly the way in which he  wanted it to be spent, which was to promote the economy &mdash; the private sector of  the economy &mdash; a project that will bring in high-level skills, high-value jobs  and contribute to economic growth and sustained economic growth over the longer  period. Today&rsquo;s decision falls into line with the purpose for which the extra  money was received in the first place, although the Assembly will want to guard  jealously its right to make decisions as to how it spends the money that comes  as a result of Barnett.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Minister referred to the allocation of &pound;20 million for housing in the June  monitoring round, and he will recall the condition that was placed on that  allocation, which was that a further &pound;20 million would be released immediately  by the Department for Social Development for Egan contracts. Does the Minister  share my concern that the Minister for Social Development has confirmed that  only &pound;8 million has been released to date? Does he also share my worry that,  although the Minister for Social Development has taken the &pound;20 million for  capital expenditure, she has not kept up her end of the bargain?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: First, the Member is correct: when I stood here in  July and made a statement on the June monitoring round, I made it clear that  there was a clear condition that the &pound;20 million for capital investment that  was made available to the Minister for Social Development was in respect of  disability adaptations and housing renovation grants. There was a clear  condition that, with capital expenditure on a sounder footing, the Minister for  Social Development would immediately release the same amount of additional  current expenditure to the Egan contracts. That is contained in the Executive  minutes and is on record in the Assembly. Indeed, her argument for doing so at  that stage was that maintenance projects and contracts had a high multiplier  effect, employed a much higher degree of local labour and could help in  regenerating the construction industry in local areas. The construction  industry, the public and the Assembly have expressed an ongoing interest in the  matter, and I will be asking the Minister for Social Development to tell the  Executive how much money she has released to the Egan projects, and I will be  seeking an assurance that the full &pound;20 million will be released by the end of  the year. It is not only the multiplier effect that that will have on the  construction industry that is involved; there is also the improvement in the  quality and stock of homes.</p>

The Committee is determined that that key programme, which benefits  sporting clubs at community level, should be carried on into future funding  periods.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly &mdash; my question will be specific &mdash; will the Minister  also note that the Committee is concerned to learn that just over &pound;2 million  that had been assigned to the Ulster-Scots   Academy has been  surrendered back to the Department of Finance and Personnel? That concerns us  because the Committee visited various projects over the summer, including an  Ulster-Scots community group in Ballymoney that needed &pound;48,000 to continue with  its programmes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must ask a question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Will the Minister note the  Committee&rsquo;s interest in both those matters and perhaps place some conditions on  the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure in future monitoring rounds?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The answer to the Chairperson&rsquo;s first question is  that the Minister will make bids for his future budget. If the Places for Sport  programme is a priority for the Minister and the Committee, of course the  Minister will make a bid, which will be considered along with all other bids.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not quite clear on the detail of the Committee&rsquo;s visit  to the Ulster-Scots group in north Antrim, but I am amazed at the Chairperson&rsquo;s  diversity: English, Irish and now Ulster Scots. Perhaps some day he will break  into Ulster Scots in the Chamber so that he and my colleague Mr Shannon, who is  not in the Chamber at present, can have a conversation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the money that that group sought was for an ongoing  project, it was probably current expenditure, whereas I understand that the  money that is being surrendered is capital expenditure. I think that I am  correct in saying that, although if not I will be happy to correct myself in a  letter to the Chairperson. It may seem odd that the Minister has surrendered &pound;2  million that had been assigned to the Ulster-Scots Academy  when an Ulster-Scots group needs &pound;48,000, but the money could not have been  transferred. That is not just a DFP rule but a Treasury rule. The Minister  could not have transferred it from capital expenditure to current expenditure,  so we are probably talking about two different things. If I am wrong, I will  come back to the Chairperson.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister (Mr Kennedy)</strong>: I am grateful to the Minister for his statement. I wish  to ask about OFMDFM departmental savings. Annex A to the Minister&rsquo;s statement  outlines a reduced requirement of &pound;11&middot;5 million under the heading &ldquo;EU Match  Funding&rdquo;. Will the Minister explain the background to that match funding, what  is meant by it, where it comes from and why it is not required at this stage?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On a wider point, can the Minister confirm that the  principle of the &pound;20 million first call on available money, an arrangement one  of his predecessors and the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety made, still stands and will continue to stand despite current  circumstances?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: On the Chairperson&rsquo;s last point, I have already  given a commitment in two ways. First, the resolution that the Executive agreed  this morning included an explicit commitment to look for and find the extra &pound;10  million that is required to facilitate the &pound;20 million first call. Secondly, I  made that commitment in my statement to the Assembly. Despite the constrained  circumstances, I have made it clear that we will do what we can to meet the  commitment to find an additional &pound;10 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The figure of &pound;11&middot;5 million that was referred to is matched  funding. Traditionally, money is held so that there will not be a hindrance. I  will write to the Member on that issue, because I am trying to make out the  writing in my notes. As far as I am aware, put simply, that money is held  centrally to match fund EU programmes. Perhaps because some of the programmes  have not come forward as quickly as might have been expected, it has not been  necessary to draw on that matched funding, hence the reduced requirement. It is  not OFMDFM money; it is money that OFMDFM holds centrally for EU programmes.  That is the position as far as I understand it from the scribble that I have  been given, and I hope that that satisfies the Member at a higher level. If he  needs more detail, I will drop him a note to explain the exact detail of the  money that was not drawn down.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mrs D Kelly)</strong>: I thank the Minister  for his statement. I welcome the reallocation of the strategic waste  infrastructure fund (SWIF) from the capital cost to the resource cost. I hope  that that will enable the Department of the Environment to allocate the  resource quickly and appropriately to ensure that Northern Ireland keeps up with its  waste management obligations. However, will the Minister assure the House that  the SWIF funding has now been placed permanently on that footing so that future  monitoring rounds do not have to be used to address the issue and so that the  organisations can be allowed to move forward on their obligations?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Carte blanche cannot be given for moving money from  capital expenditure to current expenditure. As I explained in answer to Mr  McElduff, there are rules on the reclassification of expenditure in that way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know a bit about SWIF funding because of my previous role  as Minister of the Environment. The slowdown in the projects and the  decision-making means that it is not necessary to spend all the capital money  in this year. Some money was required for areas such as the communications  strategy, so reallocations were enabled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We simply cannot say that, since the money for the waste  strategy is from capital expenditure, it can be shifted over into current  expenditure. Design work, work on planning permission, consultancy work and so on  came from revenue expenditure, so a reclassification was needed. That was  perfectly acceptable, because it was anticipated that such work would be  covered in the capital cost of a project. The capital project was not  progressing, so the money was not available and reclassification was carried  out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The general point is that a capital project of, for  example, &pound;100 million may include costs that are regarded as revenue costs  because the capital work is not progressing. In such a scenario, that money can  be released. As far as I understand it &mdash; if I am wrong, I will come back to the  Member &mdash; a request must be made when there is a disconnect between the project  starting on the ground and the preparatory work being done. That is why the  problem arose in that case.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I take some encouragement from the  Minister&rsquo;s statement and his noting of the fact that improved performance has a  direct consequence for the amount of money that will be available in future  monitoring rounds. The progress that that displays in project management and  financial management must be recognised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also encouraged by the degree of co-operation among  Ministers, which the statement acknowledges. Ministers were prepared to take a  bit of pain to contribute to the allocation for the Executive&rsquo;s response to  swine flu. That is an encouraging sign.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety&rsquo;s creative and helpful contribution, I understand that the  Minister for Social Development also made a proposition about a major project  that will not go ahead as planned. She suggested that she bring forward some  &pound;70 million. That would have made a substantial contribution towards the swine  flu epidemic as well as to the social housing fund.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must ask a question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Was an opportunity missed?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Minister for his question, albeit a long  one. I must say that Ministers did not take the pain easily; they had to be  persuaded. They fought valiantly to protect their departmental budgets, as one  would expect. To a degree, they had to be dragged towards the pain. However, I  suppose that the Member is correct: they took the pain.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although it was a good example of how Ministers must fight  their corner and argue their case, at the end of the day, we took a collective  decision on two projects. We also looked for inventive ways of dealing with the  issue. However, it was not a painless experience.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister for Social Development offered to make  available money from the Royal Exchange project, most of which had been set  aside for vesting property. However, due to legal and other difficulties it was  anticipated that it would not be spent next year and so could be brought  forward to be spent this year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The problem is that the Royal Exchange project is an  important regeneration project in the centre of Belfast, to which private investors have  contributed considerable sums in anticipation of help in assembling a site that  would enable them to deliver the project. Had the money been brought forward,  there would have been an element of bad faith. That would have sent out the  wrong signals and put the project in jeopardy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The difficulty with bringing forward and spending the &pound;70  million in 2009 is that we would have to find it in 2010 or in 2011, which  would be even worse, as we will have to deal with an even more constrained  capital Budget. Although we cannot foresee circumstances after the election, we  know that they will be worse than they are now. The chance of that bid being  successful would have been much smaller, and an invaluable urban regeneration  project might have fallen by the wayside. I am sure that the Member who is  sitting on Mr McLaughlin&rsquo;s right, Mr Fra McCann, would not have been happy if  that had been the case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For that reason, we decided that it was not a good idea to  spend &pound;70 million that had been earmarked for a project that the Executive want  to go ahead and which would have substantial benefits for Belfast city centre. To have reneged or even  hinted that we would do so would have affected investor confidence</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. He has answered some of my questions about money from the previous  monitoring round in response to Simon Hamilton. Indeed, it is also relevant to  his previous answer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the light of continuing and emerging pressures on social  housing provision, will the Minister continue to prioritise it if money becomes  available in future monitoring rounds? With respect, although I accept that Belfast has priority to a  certain degree, the need for social housing in my constituency is as great as  it is anywhere.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: First, as regards the Member&rsquo;s last point, one has  only to look at the number of capital projects and at where money is currently  being spent to realise that the Executive are addressing problems right across Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Rates (Amendment) Bill, the Final Stage of which took  place earlier today, will affect businesses all over Northern Ireland. That is  particularly relevant to sub-post offices in rural areas as they will get  enhanced help with their rates.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are also taking a range of other measures. For example,  the cap on the manufacturing rate is not specific to Belfast  or the greater Belfast area; rather, it applies  across Northern Ireland.  The measures that we are undertaking apply across the whole of Northern Ireland,  and that is right. I do not want people in parts of Northern Ireland to feel that they  are not benefiting from the decisions that are being made here; rather, I want  people to feel collectively that they have ownership of the project here and of  what results from that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, priority has been given to social housing. The difficulty  is that capital receipts have not been as high as we had anticipated. They are  worth about &pound;20 million less than we expected them to be this year. However,  Members should not underestimate the fact that the recession has also given us  the opportunity to get more for our money. As we all know, prices of new houses  have fallen dramatically, in some cases by 40%. However, the Minister for  Social Development&rsquo;s housing budget has not fallen by 40%. Therefore, we should  not automatically assume that we will get fewer houses because less money is  available. In fact, despite the reduction in revenue as result of the fall in  capital receipts, the potential exists to get substantially more for our money  by buying wisely, and that is the important point.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. I congratulate the Minister of Health on  finding &pound;10 million. I also welcome the news that the Executive have agreed to  move forward on the estimated costs for addressing swine flu. I encourage the  Finance Minister to put as much pressure on Westminster as possible in order to  get funding that meets the demands that swine flu has placed on the health  budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I seek an assurance from the Minister that he will make  health a priority in the next monitoring round.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: First, I made it clear that I alone will not be  seeking additional money from the Treasury. I spoke to the Scottish and Welsh  Finance Ministers, and collectively we will raise the issue at our next meeting  with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. We already raised that issue in  writing; however, we have not had a very positive response. Nevertheless, we  will not let up on trying to get additional funding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If anything should qualify for contingency funding from the  Treasury, swine flu should, given the nature of the problem and the spending  that it entails. However, the Treasury has said that it believes that the  devolved Administrations should find the additional money in their budgets.  Indeed, it expects the Department of Health in England to find additional money in  its budget. The issue is being pursued. Of course, the First Minister and  deputy First Minister also raised the issue at the last Joint Ministerial  Committee plenary meeting. The two other Finance Ministers and I will follow  that up when we meet the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked about making health a priority. I  reiterate what I said on about four other occasions &mdash; in the agreement that was  signed at the Executive meeting; in today&rsquo;s statement; and in the answers that  I gave to Members &mdash; we will make our best endeavours to find the &pound;10 million  gap in the &pound;20 million first call in the December and February monitoring  rounds.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  join my colleague Stephen Farry in welcoming the Minister&rsquo;s &ldquo;October monitoring  round&rdquo; statement. The Minister has correctly identified that, as Departments  become more efficient in spending money, the amount of money that becomes  available at monitoring rounds becomes smaller. In that light and without wishing  to sound too much like Declan O&rsquo;Loan, does the Minister agree that it will be  necessary to have a proper Budget &mdash; however time-consuming and bureaucratic, as  he described it, that may be &mdash; that can drill down into priorities, rather than  merely dealing with money that is voluntarily surrendered by Departments? Does  the Minister accept that, although top-slicing all Departments to cover the  cost of swine flu may be the only available short-term remedy, it is not a good  example of dealing with prioritisation?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Seven months in advance of the next financial year,  I took the step of identifying the pressures that I knew existed at that stage.  Some Members have said that that &pound;370 million might not be the end of the story  because, for example, the equal pay claim had not been factored in, and we do  not know what the final outcome of that will be. Nevertheless, I gave my  Executive colleagues the picture, as I understood it, seven months in advance,  so that we could have exactly the type of debate that the Member mentioned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Instead of top-slicing, I would much rather that we could  reassess the relevance of programmes from two or three years ago. Such  programmes may have been created with the best of intentions, but we could decide  whether those programmes have been effective and whether they should be  continued. Some programmes must be given a high priority, and, if we do not  have enough money, we could decide to cut those projects that are lower down  the priority scale. That would be the sensible way forward and the right way of  doing it. However, that still would not deal with an unforeseen crisis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Knowing the pressures that are coming down the line, we  plan ahead and try to deal with those in such a way that they do not become  crises. However, occasionally, we will still be hit with things that we did not  foresee. Such circumstances can emerge overnight and require payment almost  immediately. In those circumstances, going back to the departmental budgets &mdash;  to top-slice, to take action or to cut a particular programme &mdash; cannot be ruled  out. No Department is going to offer to supply all the money for an unforeseen  issue or emergency, especially if it falls outside that Department&rsquo;s remit.  Therefore, we cannot totally rule out top-slicing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We will have a debate on prioritisation. To be frank, I do  not care if that comes in the form of a ministerial statement or a tabled  debate; that depends on how it is to be presented to the Assembly. However, I  think that that is probably a much more sensible approach to dealing with those  types of pressures.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement and his frank and honest answers. I know  that he has a difficult job. In light of the fact that the reduced require&shy;ments  represent 57&middot;7% of the amount declared at the same stage last year and  following the Minister&rsquo;s announcement that the overcommitment will be significantly  reduced, does he believe that there is a danger that the Executive will break  Treasury rules this financial year? Can he outline the consequences if that  were to happen?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Apart from being embarrassing, I believe that the  consequences would be quite dire. The Treasury would not look very kindly on  that. That is why we could not, as some have suggested, simply fund pressures  through over&shy;commitment and why we could not leave the overcommitment at the  level at which it stood. Therefore, we put some money towards reducing the  overcommitment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member has identified the issue very well: the Treasury  will not tolerate overspend. We feel that we have got the overcommitment down  to a level that is just on the edge of being prudent. We cannot afford to allow  spending to slip and thus increase the overcommitment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we approach the end of the year, we will have to tighten  up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member mentioned the reduction in requirements.  However, even if the trend in that reduction, which is currently 57% of that  declared at the same time last year, were to continue in the December and  February monitoring rounds, we would probably be in a position to bring the  overcommitment down to an acceptable level.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. He will agree that it is in the public  interest to have increased visibility in all departmental finance issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Why has the Minister left the departmental bids out of his  statement? When will he provide us with the detail of those bids?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The departmental bids were left out of the  statement, because we dealt with only certain bids. We did not accept the other  bids, so we were not considering them. We were able to consider only the bids  relating to swine flu and the CSeries project. However, each Committee will be  aware of and, presumably, will have discussed the departmental bids; they may  even have had some input into those bids.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am quickly looking through my statement, but it only  details the reduced requirements. However, it should be possible to supply the  Member with details of all the bids that were made.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Seven health trusts are telling us that they will overspend by tens of millions  of pounds this year if they do not cut front line services. As no more money  has been allocated, is the Minister telling those trusts to cut front line  services?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Is there any help to address the issues around Civil  Service equal pay claims and the relevant back pay, because I do not see any in  the statement?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: All Departments have pressures. Indeed, there was no  Department that did not seek additional money for one thing or another. The  Member who asked the previous question mentioned departmental bids, and the  Committees will be aware of the detail of those bids. Every Department would  like to spend more money: that is the nature of any Government Department or  business.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Minister has to manage his budget within the  agreed limits. I remind the Member that when the three-year Budget settlement  was agreed, the Health Minister said that he had got a good deal for health.  Those were his words, not mine. He negotiated what he felt was a deal and, like  every other Minister, he must live within his allocation. When efficiencies  have to be made, I prefer them to be made in ways that do not hit front line  services. However, it will be up to the Health Minister and the trusts to  decide how to live within their budgets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member&rsquo;s second point was about equal pay in the Civil  Service. We cannot factor in anything for equal pay at the moment; &pound;100 million  is available from the Treasury for pressures, including equal pay. I do not  know what the final figure for equal pay will be, but, as I said to other  Members, if that pressure arises this year, we will have to revisit existing  budgets. If it arises next year, it will be included in the debate that the  Executive must have about pressures. I have already identified &pound;370 million of  pressures. If there are additional pressures as a result of the equal pay  issue, they will be included in that debate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh r&aacute;iteas an  Aire. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. I refer him to the money for road  safety that was returned by the Department of the Environment. The Minister may  be aware that road fatalities are up compared with this time last year and,  indeed, the year before. Will the Minister clarify what that returned money was  for, and does he agree that the Department should use that money properly to  address road safety issues and introduce measures to reduce road facilities?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Again, the Department of the Environment is  responsible for the detail of why that money was returned. I understand,  however, that there was a depreciation and cost-of-capital cover which the  Department did not require in this financial year. That money could not have  been spent on, for example, an advertising campaign. Therefore, it had to be  returned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would rather see money being returned than simply being  spent without any real planning. The proper way to use money which becomes  available as a result of a reduced requirement is through a programme of  planned spending, rather than spending it quickly. If the Minister identified  money that could not be used for the purposes for which it was allocated, then  he did the right thing in returning it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: As the next item of business is Question Time, I propose, by leave  of the Assembly, to suspend the sitting until 3.00 pm.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 2.36 pm.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker <span class="Italic">[Mr  McClarty]</span> in the Chair)</p>

    <p class="OralWrittenAnswersHeading"><a name="5"></a>Oral Answers to Questions</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading">Social Development</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Royal Exchange</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr B  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for an update on the Royal  Exchange development in Belfast.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 216/10<a name="AQO21610"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: The Royal Exchange is the next major  retail-led development planned for the north-east quarter of Belfast city centre and is similar in scale  to the Victoria Square  development. My Department is currently finalising the development agreement  for the scheme, which provides the legal contract for the statutory planning,  commercial and funding requirements. The development agreement will set out the  timetable and funding requirements for the scheme, and I will make an  announcement about that as soon as the agreement has been finalised with the  developer.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer, spoken like a true leader. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Not that there are not others, of course.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wonder whether, when she is not considering other  important matters of state, the Minister would care to tell me what plans she  has to support Lisburn, the real capital of Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The Member will be very well aware that, in the last  two and a half years, I have visited Lisburn on a number of occasions. I have  examined the potential of the Lisburn City Council area and have talked to the  MLAs, the MP and the councillors for that area about its requirements. I am  very pleased that a hotel development was recently opened in Lisburn, the first  one for a long time. For me, that signals progress.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the master plan for Lisburn, the consultants, as  the Member will be only too well aware, have been asked to produce a retail  strategy for the city centre, and that will guide us on the scale and type of  retailing provision that Lisburn can sustain to help it maintain its  competitiveness. The master plan will look at other ways in which the economy  of Lisburn can be developed, so that it is not solely dependent on retailing.  The master plan will look at strategies to develop the office market, the  leisure market and other areas of the economy in order to broaden the city&rsquo;s  economic base and ensure economic, environmental and commercial regeneration  for the next 25 years. That is the whole purpose of a master plan: it looks at  the potential of a place such as Lisburn and suggests how it can be developed  to its full potential for the benefit of the local residents.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Minister will be glad to hear that I will not give her leadership bid the  kiss of death by intimating anything that might sound like support. Does the  Minister agree that the undue delay in the Royal Exchange scheme is creating  uncertainty that is not helpful for potential developers of land or buildings  adjacent to or around the area outlined for the scheme? Does she also agree  that the sequential development policy could be having a detrimental effect on  potential investment in Belfast  city centre?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The Member has posed two specific questions about the  issues of the potential slippage in the Royal Exchange budget and the policy of  the Department in relation to the sequencing of development. In relation to the  latter, I have already been looking at that issue, and, as the Member is  probably aware, legal advice has been received in respect of that matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the first question, as part of the Budget  2008-2011 settlement, &pound;110 million was allocated in the investment strategy to  take forward the Royal Exchange project from next year onwards. I am hopeful  that that could happen and I look forward to receiving support for that. The  project has slipped, but I have every confidence that it will go ahead. We all  must remember that we are in an economic downturn and a global recession, and  we have to be able to reflect that and work with it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Basil commented on the Minister&rsquo;s  leadership challenge. Perhaps Basil has a similar conflict of interest in his  party, but I will not delve any further into that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister clarify some points about how the  sequencing policy affects the north-west quarter of Belfast? Several years ago, Westfield  proposed to spend more than &pound;200 million in the hope of regenerating that part  of Belfast. No  one has questioned the sequencing policy when it comes to the Royal Exchange,  because that area badly needs regeneration. However, the north and west of Belfast are also areas of  great need, and the sequencing policy has delayed their regeneration by several  years. If, after considering that in the near future, the sequencing could be  changed to allow that development to go ahead, it would help to regenerate that  part of Belfast  too.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Mr Maskey for his question. He also referred to  the Department&rsquo;s policy of sequencing developments whereby when one is  complete, another comes on track. He will know that, in the past, the  Department relied on retail-led analysis and retail-capacity analysis of Belfast city centre. I do  not deny the need for the north-west quarter of Belfast to be developed, particularly the  area around the CastleCourt complex. Over the past year, I met potential  developers to discuss that. However, the Department&rsquo;s policy on regeneration in  the city of Belfast  is guided by legal advice.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Will the Minister provide an update on the Streets Ahead initiative in Belfast?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am delighted to inform the Assembly that the Streets  Ahead project in Belfast  is on course for completion by September 2011. The benefit from my Department&rsquo;s  &pound;20 million investment in renewing the public streets in Belfast city centre can be seen in the  creation of an attractive environment for shoppers, visitors and investors. The  project will enhance Belfast&rsquo;s reputation as a  major retail city, alongside cities such as Manchester,  Glasgow, Newcastle  and Dublin.  However, I sound a note of caution: an investment in creating a quality public  realm will achieve its full potential in a city centre such as Belfast only when accompanied by an excellent  maintenance and cleansing regime. I am confident that that will happen in Belfast.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Only last week, I had an opportunity to walk round the city  centre to see evidence of the regeneration work that has been done, and I was  most impressed. The staff on site were a bit shocked to see me walking through  the city centre alone. I also identified that, on completion of the project, a  partnership approach will have to be taken with Belfast City Council on a total  cleansing regime. The important benefit of Streets Ahead is that it acts as a  further catalyst for the economic and retail-led regeneration of the core of Belfast city centre.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members that supplementary questions should relate to the original  question.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Warm Homes Scheme</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Hilditch </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for her assessment of  the services delivered by the new service provider for the warm homes scheme. (AQO 217/10<a name="AQO21710"></a>)</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">10. <strong>Mr  Campbell </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what progress is being  made to ensure that the revised warm homes scheme has the maximum impact and  that landlords, and tenants who are currently in receipt of benefits, are aware  of the advantages of the scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  225/10<a name="AQO22510"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will answer  questions 2 and 10 together.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The warm homes scheme is the Executive and the Department  for Social Development&rsquo;s (DSD) main weapon in tackling fuel poverty. I remain  committed to alleviating fuel poverty in Northern Ireland. Following a  competitive tendering process, the new contract for the scheme was awarded on 1  July 2009. H&amp;A Mechanical Services and the Bryson Charitable Group are the  new managers. It is expected that that competitive process will yield the  maximum value for money in the delivery of the scheme. In other words, we  should get more done with the resources that are available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will be aware that we have stringent monitoring  arrangements in place with the Housing Executive, which is responsible for  administering the scheme, and with the scheme managers. Monthly monitoring  meetings are in place at which scheme managers provide detailed reports on  progress to date against targets. Inevitably, as with the award of any new  contract, there is a settling-in period. However, I am pleased with the  progress that both scheme managers have made to date. At the end of September,  over 2,500 eligible referrals had already been received. The scheme managers  recently submitted a joint marketing plan, and extensive activities are planned  over the coming months.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I suggest that all Members should encourage eligible  constituents to make contact with the scheme managers to avail themselves of  the range of energy efficiency measures that are on offer under the warm homes  scheme. Furthermore, the scheme is being promoted through information and  advice material in the jobs and benefits network. It also forms part of the overall  approach that is being taken to increase benefit uptake. There is a joint  approach to tackling fuel poverty with those who are in receipt of low incomes  and with those who urgently need their homes heated to keep warm this winter.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. I have met one of the contractors, and I  appreciate the work that has been carried out to date. However, I am concerned  that people who have oil heating systems have been removed from the criteria.  What are the Minister&rsquo;s thoughts on that matter, particularly as it impacts on  many of those who are in fuel poverty and live in areas of social deprivation?  Many of those heating systems are probably pushing 20 years of age.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: As the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Social  Development, the Member will recall that the Public Accounts Committee advised  the Department to refocus the scheme to target those who were in receipt of low  incomes. That approach was endorsed by the Committee for Social Development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am well aware that there are many people who require  replacement heating systems. Currently, however, I want to focus on the most  vulnerable people and ensure that all those who are in receipt of low incomes,  and who are eligible, get the appropriate heating in place in their homes so  that we can tackle the issue of fuel poverty in a fulsome and holistic way. The  Member will be well aware that over 71,000 households are now warmer since 2001  as a result of the successful warm homes scheme.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  The Minister outlined some of the benefits of the new scheme. I think that  people will warmly &mdash; pardon the pun &mdash; welcome the scheme. In that respect, does  she agree that public meetings, such as the meeting that I am organising on  Thursday night in Coleraine town hall, in which the contractor speaks to  landlords and tenants who have received invitations from active public  representatives are a good way to publicise the scheme and ensure that the  contractor gets the message out to a targeted audience so that the best benefit  is reaped by those at whom the scheme is targeted?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am sure that there is always a benefit in  advertising. I agree with the Member that that is a good way to publicise the  scheme. My colleague from Mid Ulster Patsy McGlone is organising such a meeting  in Cookstown. All Members should inform their constituents of the potential  benefits of such a scheme so that they can see quite clearly what is on offer.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. In the Minister&rsquo;s answer to question  1, I wonder whether she was suggesting that she should not be let out on her  own. Will the Minister give us some idea of when the backlog for the warm homes  scheme will be dealt with? In particular, I am thinking about pensioners in my  constituency who have been waiting since July 2007.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I will deal with the second part of the question first.  The details of those on the waiting list have been passed to the new scheme  managers, both of which are contacting individuals on the waiting list to  advise them of the new eligibility criteria. I expect that process to be  completed by the end of November, but I have indicated that I want the task  dealt with as expeditiously as possible: in other words, much more quickly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the first part of his question, as a public  representative the Member will know that we go to many places on our own to  examine the needs of our constituents.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Minister for her earlier replies on this important matter.  Will she assure the House that the proactive promotion of the warm homes scheme  will ensure that people in all parts of Northern   Ireland, particularly in the Newry and Armagh  constituency, will be made aware of the details of the scheme: how to apply,  when to apply and what they can expect?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The Member is probably aware that for the scheme&rsquo;s  purpose, Northern Ireland  has been separated in two; the northern part is managed by H&amp;A Mechanical  Services and the southern part, which includes Newry and Mourne, by the Bryson  Charitable Group. To my best knowledge, all of that information has been  communicated through all available media. However, if the Member knows of any  &ldquo;chinks in the armour&rdquo;, he should let me know so that I can rectify them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Can the Minister tell us what contribution the warm homes scheme has made to  the alleviation of fuel poverty in Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The three factors that impact on fuel poverty are  income, fuel prices and energy efficiency. The warm homes scheme has been  hugely popular and very successful since its introduction in 2001. More than  &pound;118 million has been spent on making more than 71,000 households warmer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to heating and insulation measures,  householders have received advice on maximising household income through  ensuring that vulnerable people claimed all of the benefits to which they were  entitled. We estimate that, since introducing benefit checks as part of the  warm homes scheme, an additional &pound;4 million a year is now being paid in  benefits. We also estimate that &pound;200 million of indirect benefits have accrued  in the form of health, education, employment and the environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, energy efficiency is but one element in the  alleviation of fuel poverty. Energy prices and incomes are the other key  variables, and the best that we can do in relation to them is to build a  strong, prosperous economy that raises current incomes and, above all, lifts  people out of fuel poverty.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 3 has been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Special Purchase of &nbsp;Evacuated Dwellings Scheme</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Spratt </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for an update on the  funding of the special purchase of evacuated dwellings scheme, with particular  reference to cases which have already been approved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 219/10<a name="AQO21910"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Funding for the special purchase of evacuated dwellings  (SPED) scheme for this year is &pound;1&middot;5 million. It is estimated that &pound;9 million in  funding will be required to meet the current level of applications. To date  this year, 53 applications have been received and 13 completed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The scheme is normally self-financing, or close to it. The  difficulty is that the Housing Executive finds itself paying for houses that it  has problems selling on. Following the recent Executive announcement on the  SPED scheme, it was agreed that the Department for Social Development would  immediately provide the money to fund the statutory SPED scheme to enable all  approved applications to be met. Immediate and intensified efforts will be made  to sell the existing SPED housing stock, and, if a shortfall is identified  between the moneys paid and the income received prior to the end of the  February monitoring round, the Executive will meet that shortfall.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To be candid, I should say that I have strong reservations  about the scheme in general.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although there is a need to help those who have been  intimidated, for whom we all have great sympathy, a situation in which we buy  homes from such people and sell them on to people who are more acceptable to  the intimidators is not a long-term solution to the problem, and that is a  matter that I will take up with the Northern Ireland Office. I have already had  discussions with the Security Minister, Paul Goggins.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the Chief Constable only issues certificates in  cases in which it is absolutely necessary to do so? Given the number of  certificates that he has issued so far this year &mdash; I think the Minister  mentioned a figure of 53 &mdash; and the fact that he has turned down quite a number  of others, does the Minister agree that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive  is legally bound to purchase those houses? In addition, given the areas in  which some of those houses are situated, could some of them be used for social  housing? Furthermore, does the Minister agree that the extra strain and  pressure that was so publicly exerted over the airwaves on a family a number of  weeks ago was unnecessary, hurtful and unhelpful?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The Member raised some issues with respect to the SPED  scheme, the first of which was in respect of Chief Constable&rsquo;s certificates. I  can safely say that responsibility for that scheme should not be with the  Northern Ireland Housing Executive; it is a security matter, and responsibility  for it should be with the Northern Ireland Office. Secondly, it is wrong to  highlight any particular issue. I do not wish to get into predicting levels of  intimidation in Northern    Ireland. For me, one more case of  intimidation is one too many. Finally, the Finance Minister and I have drawn a  line on this issue, and I suggest that the Member should do likewise.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response. Will she outline to the House the expected  shortfall in the housing budget for 2010-11, which will have a detrimental  effect on those exceptional cases under the SPED scheme?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The projected funding shortfall for the next year is  &pound;107 million. We are facing a significant shortfall in the capital budget, so  all programmes are likely to be affected. Some people may think that I am  making too much of this issue, but no other mainstream Executive programme,  whether in health, education, roads or training, has been as devastated by the  economic downturn as the housing programme. I repeat: we must all agree once  and for all to put housing on a firm financial footing.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  answer. However, only 13 out of 53 applications have been approved. I am glad  for those 13 families, but, in my constituency, I am dealing with two families  that, unfortunately and disgracefully, have received racial abuse to the point  at which one family&rsquo;s house was petrol-bombed. Since then, that family has  found out that it has been refused a certificate. Does the Minister have any  influence with the Chief Constable in issuing certificates? Moreover, what  circumstances qualify a family to be issued with a certificate? If one family  is deemed to be under threat in one set of circumstances and another is refused  a certificate under another set of circumstances, people in my constituency  rightly conclude that it all depends on who you are and who you get on the  radio with.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I do not know about those particular cases; the Member  should pass on the details of them to me. I firmly repeat what I said at the  beginning: I will not get into predicting levels of intimidation. I greatly  sympathise and empathise with anybody who finds themselves in such a situation.  I have also had constituents who have found themselves in that position.  However, the programme clearly belongs to a security budget, rather than to one  for housing, and the matter requires further discussions between me and the  Security Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Member to pass me details of those cases so that  they can be fully investigated directly with the Housing Executive and, more  importantly, with the Chief Constable. Confidential issues are involved, and we  want to safeguard everyone&rsquo;s privacy, security and safety.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  heard the Minister say that she would like to draw a line under this matter,  but I am sure that Members want to know whether she is happy with how the  Minister of Finance dealt with her on this matter and whether she had any  difficulty in how the negotiations were handled.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I have had various conversations with the Minister in  the Executive. I tabled the matter for discussion on 10 September. I did not  beckon publicity in respect of this matter. I am happy with the outcome of that  Executive meeting, which was arrived at after extensive discussions and  negotiations. It is a satisfactory outcome for everyone.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Social Housing</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr F  McCann </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development how many units of social  accommodation have been agreed with the developers of the Titanic Quarter and  the Sirocco works. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 220/10<a name="AQO22010"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The Member asked me a similar question in May. I am  surprised that he continues to ask about those specific sites. Perhaps he has  his eye on one of the new homes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The new developments at the Titanic Quarter and the Sirocco  site offer significant opportunities to deliver social and affordable housing  as well as shared housing. As part of phase 2 of the Titanic Quarter, 15% of  the homes provided will be for social and affordable housing; 10% will be  provided in the Titanic Quarter itself; and a further 5% at another site to be  agreed. The developer has also agreed to provide 15% of the Sirocco site for  social and affordable housing. In both cases, it is not possible to say exactly  to how many homes that will equate, as that will ultimately depend on the final  number of private homes provided. However, both arrangements have been made  possible only with the goodwill and agreement of the developers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will recall that, as part of the new housing  agenda, I made it clear that Northern Ireland  should no longer be the only region in Britain  and Ireland  that did not have a formal policy to direct a developer contribution in all new  developments. Such a policy would remove any inconsistency or ambiguity between  developments, as well as offering certainty and clarity for all future  developments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her response, but she seems to be offended every time  I ask a question in the House. I continue to try to find out how many units of  accommodation will be forthcoming from those developments. The number of  housing units that will be built in the Titanic Quarter and the Sirocco site is  an open secret.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Has the Minister discussed whether that accommodation will  be for single people or for a mix of single and family accommodation? Will she  guarantee that communities that live around those developments in east Belfast will be fully  consulted to ensure that their considerations will be taken into account in the  making of decisions?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am sorry if Mr McCann feels offended. He is fully  aware that, in social housing, the largest complement on waiting lists for any  urban area is made up of people who live by themselves. I am sure that the  needs of the local community will be fully addressed in relation to that  matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to community consultation, I am sure that the  developers will be available to talk to Mr McCann if he wishes to have such a  meeting.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod" style="page-break-before:always;">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="6"></a>Question for urgent oral answer</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Cattle Theft: Keady</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Speaker has received notice of a question for urgent oral  answer, in accordance with Standing Order 20A, for the Minister of Agriculture  and Rural Development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="BoldText">Mr Savage</span> asked the Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development to detail the circumstances surrounding the  theft of 16 cattle infected by tuberculosis and brucellosis, which were under  DARD responsibility on Castleblayney Road, Keady, on Monday 5 October and to  outline:</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">a. what immediate action has been taken, or will be taken,  by her Department to regain possession of the infected cattle;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">b. what immediate action has been taken, or will be taken,  to protect cattle across Northern    Ireland; and</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">c. what immediate action has been taken, or will be taken,  to stop a similar incident taking place in the future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: The question is about the  theft of 16 cattle infected by tuberculosis (TB) that were under the control of  the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) on the Castleblayney  Road in Keady on Monday 5 October.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The contracted haulier arranged to collect 17 TB-reactor  cattle from a herd in Armagh. Initial  indications are that, when the haulier arrived at the farm, he was unable to  negotiate the entrance with two trailers attached to his lorry. He unhitched  the rear trailer and parked it in a lay-by in the area. He then returned to the  farm to collect the 17 TB-reactor cattle. On arrival, he discovered that the  animals that had been gathered for collection had disappeared; they are  presumed stolen. On returning to the parked trailer, the haulier then  discovered that the 16 TB-infected animals had been unloaded and had also  disappeared. The theft is under investigation by the PSNI, and my Department  will work closely with the PSNI and co-operate fully with that investigation.  My Chief Veterinary Officer has written to the Chief Constable to underline the  seriousness of the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The theft of TB-reactor cattle is a very irresponsible  action as those animals pose a significant risk of TB infection to any  livestock with which they come into contact. All DARD field staff have been  alerted to the theft and told to report any suspicions, as have the authorities  in the South. I also ask any farmer who is offered cattle and whose suspicions  are aroused to report the matter to the authorities. As this stage, there is no  indication of the whereabouts of the cattle, thus it is not practical to apply  any additional disease-control measures. I have stated publicly that the  perpetrators of this crime have total disregard for the health status of the  cattle population here and for the good reputation of the industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The question asks what immediate action is being taken to  stop a similar incident taking place in the future. The contractor responsible  for the collection of reactor cattle has been instructed to enhance security  measures and precautions to prevent any recurrence of such an incident. DARD  will also consider the need for additional safeguards as a result of the  incident.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  One thing that concerns me and many others in the farming industry is the  amount of time spent testing animals and finding cattle that have been infected  with such diseases. This incident has inflicted stress on farmers who fear  losing their cattle, and it has had financial costs for the Department and  embarrassed the Department and all those involved in the agriculture industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development  discussed the welfare of animals at its meeting today. If it had been a farmer  &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to come to his question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  Had it been an individual farmer who had lost even one animal from an infected  farm, the Department would have thrown the book at him. It would have  confiscated everything belonging to him for keeping cattle. At this point in  time, we need an assurance from the Minister that what happened will not happen  again. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development cannot take for  granted the well-being of the farming industry here. The industry has already  been put through a lot of stress, only to find out that cattle lifted from a  farm were parked along the side of the road and that somebody came along and  took them. That cannot be allowed to happen again in this day and age.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I want to clear up a couple of points.  First, this type of theft has never occurred in the North before, and my  Department will review procedures as a result. I emphasise that the  responsibility for this crime &mdash; it is a crime &mdash; rests with the people who  committed it. Those people are content to undermine the good work that DARD and  the industry are doing to control and eradicate major diseases.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member referred to diseases. The stolen animals were TB  reactors, so there is a very low risk of brucellosis. Some of them came from a  farm that had been closed down for brucellosis, but the animals concerned are  not brucellosis reactors. The disease in question is TB; there is no risk of  any other disease in this case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department has to be robust in its dealings with  animals. If an animal goes missing, for whatever reason, we have to know why  that happened. We cannot allow farmers to put us in the position where our  traceability systems do not stand up. In August 2007, there was an outbreak of  foot-and-mouth disease in England.  We argued for our industry, and it was our robust traceability systems that  saved our industry from the same types of restrictions that were placed on Britain at that  time. We cannot allow those systems to be undermined in any way. We work with  the industry and with the farmers&rsquo; unions, as we should, to ensure that we have  the best traceability systems and that they are robust.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development (Mr Paisley Jnr)</strong>:  The Committee echoes what has been said today about reporting any information  to the police. I urge anyone who has any information about the matter to bring  it to the attention of the police immediately and allow them to bring to book  the person who is responsible for the theft, thereby ensuring that that person  is punished properly and adequately.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we echo some of the concerns that have been  raised. The beasts that were taken from the farm were under the duty of care of  the Department, and that duty of care is being examined. We look forward to the  outcome of that examination, and, if it is recommended that tightened  regulations be put in place, we want to see that happen.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What value has been placed on the beasts that were stolen?  Will the Minister inform the House of any communication that is going on with  counterparts in the Republic of Ireland and the rest of the UK as a result  of the theft?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I do not have a valuation of the  animals. An indicative value is around &pound;1,000 a beast, so we are talking about  a value of &pound;17,000 for the 17 animals. However, I stress that that is a  ballpark figure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We informed the PSNI about the theft, and we talked to the  Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to let them know that the animals were in transit somewhere and  that they should be on the alert. As has happened in the past, we have had to  deal with the issue on an all-Ireland basis. That is because the threat of the  TB-reactor animals to farms in the South is equal to the danger that is posed  to farmers in the North. Our systems kicked into action straight away, and we  informed all the necessary agencies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Again, I appeal to people who have knowledge of the  animals&rsquo; whereabouts to make it known to the authorities. The animals were to  be lifted and taken away so that they could be destroyed. We do not want 16 or  17 animals that pose a risk to the industry to be located around the country.  We are working very hard to eradicate TB and brucellosis, and I get angry about  anything that is done to undermine that work. I am angry about this unfortunate  incident; we did not want it to happen. We want to have robust systems in  place, and we will be looking at all aspects of the incident to make sure that  systems are tightened up.</p>
