              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural
              Development </b>(Ms Rodgers): The second meeting of the
              North/South Ministerial Council on the Foyle, Carlingford and
              Irish Lights Commission (FCILC) sector took place on 5&nbsp;July
              in Dublin. Following nomination by the First&nbsp;Minister and the
              Deputy First Minister, Mr&nbsp;Michael&nbsp;McGimpsey and I
              represented Northern Ireland. Mr&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;Fahey TD,
              Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, represented the
              Irish Government. The Executive Committee noted the papers for the
              Council on 29&nbsp;June. The meeting opened with a useful update
              from the chairman, Peter Savage, and the interim chief executive,
              Derick&nbsp;Anderson. They outlined the Loughs Agency’s progress
              to date in taking forward the work of the agency and, in
              particular, the progress in relation to the agency’s proposed
              work programme. The Council then considered and approved a number
              of papers put before it. These were the corporate plan for the
              years 2000-02; a code of conduct for board members of the FCILC; a
              code of conduct for the staff of the Loughs Agency; a draft
              equality scheme for the agency; and regulations for angling
              permits for the Rivers Foyle and Finn. The Council also gave its
              approval, subject to the final approval of both Finance Ministers,
              to the staffing proposals put forward by the Loughs Agency.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, the Council was updated on the
              making of the legislation to enhance the functions of the Loughs
              Agency of the FCILC in line with the North/South Co-operation
              (Implementation Bodies) (Northern Ireland) Order 1999, and in
              relation to the transfer of the functions of the Commissioners of
              Irish Lights to the body.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Council agreed to meet again in
              September — although I understand that that has now been put
              back until early November — and approved the issue of a joint
              communiqué, a copy of which has been placed in the Library. I am
              making this report on behalf of myself and Mr&nbsp;McGimpsey.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for her report. My
              questions relate to paragraph 7 of the report and, in particular,
              the reference to legislation transferring the functions of the
              Commissioners of Irish Lights to the North/South body. Does the
              Minister agree that the essential problem that the legislation
              will have to tackle is that historically Irish inshore lights in
              both Northern Ireland and the Republic have been subsidised out of
              the general lighthouse fund administered by the Department of
              Environment, Transport and the Regions? There is an issue of
              cross-subsidisation of the functions here from Great&nbsp;Britain.
              Does the Minister agree that in the light of that financial
              transfer, it would be sensible for the British-Irish Council to be
              involved in the Irish Lights function as well as the North/South
              Ministerial Council?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Officials are working to achieve a transfer as
              quickly and effectively as possible. As the Member will
              appreciate, marine safety is a sensitive issue subject to
              international conventions. Transferring responsibility in a way
              which allows both the United Kingdom and Ireland to continue to
              meet their obligations is a complex issue. There are unique
              funding arrangements for the Commissioners of Irish Lights through
              the general lighthouse fund, and it is necessary to ensure proper
              accountability for that funding. Furthermore, a legislative
              vehicle must be identified to make the transfer of functions at
              Westminster. The Department of Environment, Transport and the
              Regions is concerned about the level of funding from the Irish
              Government, but that is a matter for the United Kingdom and Irish
              Governments.</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the past few months anglers have had
              major difficulties pertaining to Ballyarton weir and the River
              Faughan. What is the current position with regard to the
              improvements there?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware from the Member’s representations
              that there have been difficulties with the weir for a number of
              months. The difficulties that were delaying the improvements to
              ease the passage of fish over the weir have now been overcome. I
              hope that the work will be completed by the end of September. An
              interim solution has been put in place to ensure that the fish can
              pass freely if the water conditions become available.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister accept that there is concern
              about the degree of secrecy that surrounds this and so many other
              meetings? She refers in paragraph 5 of her statement to a
              corporate plan for the years 2000-02, a draft code for conduct for
              board members, and various other documents. I take a considerable
              interest in this because Carlingford Lough is in the constituency
              of South Down. I am not aware of any of these documents having
              been made available to Members. Can the Minister assure me that
              all the material published by this board will be brought forward
              for public debate?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not aware that there has been any secrecy.
              Reports of all North/South Ministerial Council meetings that have
              dealt with the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission have
              been published, and we have made clear what has been happening.
              For instance, the equality scheme being prepared by the Council
              will go out for consultation in the near future, and the code of
              conduct is available on request. Information about the Council’s
              work is also available.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am advised that Members are finding it
              difficult to hear those speaking in the corners of the Chamber.
              This is an unusual phenomenon. Technical checks are being made,
              but in the meantime perhaps Members in that part of the Chamber
              will project their voices more.</p>

              time in my political career, someone has found it hard to hear me.
              I asked the Minister about the corporate plan. Will it be
              published and made available to Members?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The acoustics in the Chamber must be the
              problem. I do not think that it is my hearing or the projection of
              the Member’s voice. The corporate plan has been published, or
              will be published when it is ready.</p>

              the Minister’s statement. Everyone will agree that the transfer
              of functions to the all-Ireland North/South Ministerial Council
              and the implementation body will benefit cross-border activity and
              co-operation. According to the statement, the Council was updated
              about legislation to enhance the functions of the Loughs Agency of
              the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, in line with
              the North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) (Northern
              Ireland) Order 1999. What is the position on that?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Work on aquaculture legislation and the
              transfer of functions from the Foyle Fisheries to the Loughs
              Agency, are proceeding at all levels. This includes the
              development and licensing of aquaculture on Lough Foyle. Policy
              matters have proved more difficult and complex, but legislation is
              progressing in all areas and we hope to advance it as quickly as
              possible.</p>

              two questions. She said that the corporate plan had been
              published, and then added that it will be published. Can she
              clarify this? My second question concerns the regulations for
              angling permits for the Rivers Foyle and Finn. When will these
              permits be made available to anglers?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said she was speaking on behalf of
              herself and Minister McGimpsey. We are all aware of the confusion
              arising from the involvement of two Departments in this matter. Is
              the Minister really aware of the confusion in the angling
              community over the administration of permits and licences by the
              Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and the Foyle, Carlingford
              and Irish Lights Commission? Will she undertake to try to simplify
              this matter, especially with regard to paying twice for a licence
              for a day’s angling, which could easily take place in both
              jurisdictions? This issue is important to local anglers, but it is
              more important for tourists. If local anglers are confused,
              tourists will be thoroughly confused. I hope that the Minister
              will undertake to look at this more closely.</p>

              will operate. These matters will be addressed by legislation. It
              is because of the level of interest being shown by local people
              that the legislation has been made a matter of priority. The two
              Departments are working with interested parties to ensure that
              those with an interest in the area are not disadvantaged in any
              way by the delay. I am aware of the difficulties. Consultation is
              going on with Members in the area, and I am anxious that the
              legislation be processed as a matter of urgency.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been much talk of permits and
              legislation, but I am sure that the Minister is aware of the deep
              concern about illegal fishing and netting in the Foyle system. I
              am surprised that a body meeting to consider such matters would
              not be taking this issue on board. Is the Minister aware of the
              situation and will the Commission be taking the matter forward in
              future?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the problem with poaching and
              illegal fishing. Recently there has been an increase in poaching.
              That is due to the increase in fish stocks. The Foyle, Carlingford
              and Irish Lights Commission has been successful in seizing illegal
              nets and continues to be effective in preventing poaching. The
              Commission also acknowledges the efforts which have been made by
              many private river watchers in protecting fish stocks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the efforts of those who have to
              work for the Department in those areas because it is not always an
              easy task. This year, the rate of seizure of illegal nets has been
              consistent with the numbers for last year. However, there has been
              an increase in seizures of illegally caught salmon and sea trout.
              That is because there has been an increase in the fish stock in
              the rivers.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That the Second Stage of the Fisheries
              (Amendment) Bill (NIA&nbsp;9/99) be agreed.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Bill proposes to amend the Fisheries
              (Northern Ireland) Act 1966 on behalf of the Department of
              Agriculture and Rural Development and the Department of Culture,
              Arts and Leisure. Both Departments have powers under that Act,
              following the split in fisheries functions after devolution.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Broadly speaking, the Department of Agriculture
              and Rural Development has retained responsibility for sea
              fisheries and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure is now
              responsible for inland fisheries. Since the amendments were
              proposed before devolution, it has been agreed that the Department
              of Agriculture and Rural Development will take the lead in
              bringing a single Bill to the Assembly on behalf of both
              Departments rather than each Department bringing separate Bills.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will detail all of the proposed amendments in
              my opening speech. My Colleague Mr&nbsp;McGimpsey will make the
              closing speech.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Changes to the existing legislation are
              considered necessary to allow the Department of Agriculture and
              Rural Development to regulate the collection of wild shellfish,
              which are a natural resource, from the foreshore and to use
              fisheries regulatory powers to conserve and enhance the
              environment. Collection of wild shellfish from the foreshore of
              Strangford Lough for commercial purposes has been increasing in
              recent years. During 1999 one individual used a mechanical
              harvester towed by a tractor to extract quantities of shellfish
              for onward sale. It is estimated that for a four-week period,
              beginning in mid-August, about four tonnes per day was collected.
              That is a substantial operation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Conservation bodies such as the Royal Society
              for the Protection of Birds and the National Trust have raised
              concerns with the Department about the potential ecological
              effects of ongoing extraction at this rate, particularly the
              impact on wildlife on the foreshore.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of bird species are dependent on a
              continuous rich supply of wild shellfish as food to maintain
              populations, particularly during winter months. It is too late to
              take action when the damage has been done and the bird population
              has been lost. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
              views the need to regulate the collection of wild shellfish as
              vital to ensuring the ecological balance is maintained in order to
              conserve wildlife on the foreshore. There is evidence to support
              this.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similar mechanical harvesting took place in
              Scotland in the early 1990s. In 1994 the opportunity was taken to
              amend legislation there to allow the regulation of such
              collection. In addition, the Department of Agriculture and Rural
              Development is proposing to amend the Fisheries Act (Northern
              Ireland) 1966 to bring Northern Ireland into line with the wider
              powers now available under Great Britain legislation to allow
              regulation of fishing for environmental reasons.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Legislation in Great Britain was amended in
              1995 to ensure that regulators there could protect the marine and
              aquatic environment to ensure compliance with the EC Habitats
              Directive. A parallel duty was imposed in Northern Ireland under
              conservation regulations made by the Department of Environment in
              1994.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Department of Agriculture and
              Rural Development does not have specific power to regulate sea
              fishing for environmental purposes. The proposed amendment would
              specifically empower the Department to do that. A parallel
              amendment to another section of the Fisheries Act (Northern
              Ireland) 1966, which I will describe later, will give the
              Fisheries Conservancy Board similar regulatory powers in relation
              to salmon. Further amendments to the Act are proposed which will
              make it an offence to contravene regulations made under the powers
              referred to above and will ensure that the necessary enforcement
              powers exist to enable authorised officers of the Department to
              enforce any such regulations. They may board and examine vehicles
              and equipment used in fishing and, when appropriate, seize and
              dispose of such vehicles or equipment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, the Department of Culture, Arts
              and Leisure wishes to take the following powers. It is proposed
              that restrictions which have the effect of prohibiting trade in
              salmon roe obtained from fish farms be lifted. Salmon roe is a
              viable product particularly in view of Northern Ireland’s
              disease-free status. The amendment to the Act will allow trade in
              spawn produced at a fish farm for salmon production for human
              consumption or for stock enhancement. However, it will remain
              illegal to sell spawn obtained from wild salmon.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure
              also proposes investing the Fisheries Conservancy Board with
              powers to control the removal of materials such as gravel from
              river beds. This is an important conversation measure designed to
              preserve spawning beds. It is considered necessary for the
              protection of increasingly threatened fish habitats. Gravel
              constitutes a key component of fishery habitats and is necessary
              for successful spawning. Removal of gravel from riverbeds has
              resulted in a significant deterioration in Northern Ireland’s
              fisheries and the proposed amendment will afford protection to
              this habitat.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure
              wishes to streamline the administrative process by dispensing with
              the requirement to obtain Department of Finance and Personnel
              agreement each time it varies charges for fishing permits for
              fishing the public angling estate. This approval is not required
              for other charges, and the Department of Finance and Personnel is
              content with the proposed change. The Department will publish its
              permit fees at the beginning of each season.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department also wishes to give powers to
              the Fisheries Conservancy Board (FCB) to issue licences at reduced
              rates to certain classes of person, such as the disabled. These
              powers will give the board scope to be flexible and sensitive to
              the needs of different groups in society.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure
              proposes to amend section 26 of the Act in two respects. First, it
              wishes to enable the FCB to make by-laws in respect of anything
              relating to the management and protection of fisheries. This power
              will, in particular, allow the implementation of a salmon carcass
              tagging scheme, which is designed to improve the management and
              conservation of wild salmon and sea trout stocks. Parallel schemes
              are being introduced by the relevant fisheries conservation
              agencies throughout the island of Ireland. Other agencies already
              have appropriate powers for the introduction of tagging, and it
              only remains for the FCB to be invested with the enabling powers
              to allow it to do likewise. Secondly, the amending clause provides
              the FCB with powers to regulate salmon fishing for environmental
              purposes. This parallels the proposal being sought by the
              Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to regulate sea
              fisheries for environmental purposes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final amendment relates to powers available
              to the FCB following a pollution incident. The Department of
              Culture, Arts and Leisure wishes to strengthen the powers of the
              FCB to reinstate polluted waters and to recover the full cost of
              this from the polluter. Reinstatement will include restocking,
              restoration and enhancement of fish habitats to pre-pollution
              levels. FCB’s powers are at present limited purely to
              restocking. The effects of pollution go beyond the loss of fish
              evident in a fish kill. While restocking could supplement fish
              stocks lost to pollution, reinstatement would take into account
              the other physical and biological effects necessary to restore a
              fishery as a biodiverse habitat, such as invertebrate and plant
              recovery and habitat restoration.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will note that the financial and
              explanatory memorandum has been amended. Originally when this Bill
              was drafted it was4 felt that the FCB would take on the additional
              work proposed in this legislation through reorganisation and
              internal efficiencies. It is now unlikely that the board will be
              able to meet the cost from its own resources and, therefore, some
              additional funding may need to be found, but we believe that this
              will not, relatively speaking, be significant.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague, Mr McGimpsey, has also written to
              the Chairman of the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee, Mr ONeill,
              advising him of a review of the functions of the FCB in the light
              of the changes following devolution.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Assembly to support this Second Stage
              motion, which will allow the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Culture, Arts and
              Leisure Committee (Mr ONeill):</b> I welcome this legislation.
              However small, it is at least a start. There are huge challenges
              facing both Ministers with regard to the health of fishing and
              angling in Northern Ireland. I often think that the health of
              rivers and lakes is a clear indication of the health of the
              environment in general. They are almost like the lungs in a body.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This year we have experienced some of the worst
              examples of pollution. They have occurred with such regularity
              that when the statistics are pulled together at the end of the
              year, I imagine they will show that it has been one of the worst
              years in the last 40 or 50. We have major challenges ahead.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are references to the foreshore in
              clauses&nbsp;1&nbsp;and&nbsp;2. Part of the existing problem in
              relation to the harvesting of shellfish is the exploitative way in
              which it has been carried out in Strangford Lough in the example
              quoted by the Minister. One thing that needs to be clarified —
              and I am not sure if it is clarified sufficiently in the Bill —
              is the definition of &quot;foreshore&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should all welcome clause&nbsp;5, which will
              allow the tagging scheme to come into effect in Northern Ireland.
              Some time ago an arrangement was made between the Department here
              and the fishing authorities in the South of Ireland for an
              all-Ireland tagging scheme to regulate and control the terrible
              poaching and misuse of our wild fish stocks. However, it was not
              possible to introduce this tagging scheme fully in Northern
              Ireland because of legislative arrangements. We should all welcome
              this clause, as it will introduce appropriate by-laws to
              facilitate the implementation of the salmon carcass tagging
              scheme. Having that throughout the island will be a considerable
              advance which will be welcomed greatly by those in angling and
              environmentally concerned bodies who wish to see changes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause&nbsp;7 concerns the reinstatement of
              polluted waters. As I have already outlined, there is great
              concern about this summer’s events. It is to be welcomed that
              the word has been changed from &quot;restocking&quot; to
              &quot;reinstatement&quot;, for, as Minister&nbsp;Rodgers has
              pointed out, there is much more to do than simple restocking after
              a river has been polluted or poisoned to the extent that all life
              has been destroyed. Restocking without providing the ecosystem on
              which the fish can survive is not sufficient.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to ask whether the Department has
              given any thought to ensuring that native stock can be held for
              use in reinstating and reinvigorating particular stretches of
              polluted water. This is of great concern, for some restocking
              schemes have in the past used fish alien to the local area, a
              practice which was not very successful. When considering
              reinstatement we should be thinking of a much more comprehensive
              approach encompassing issues such as introducing native stock to a
              particular area or river network. It also begs the question of the
              collection, preservation and storage of sufficient amounts of such
              stock to be available whenever these unfortunate disasters occur.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are all concerned about the sea fisheries.
              Although the remit of our Committee covers only inland areas, sea
              fishing clearly has a big impact on stocks of wild salmon and sea
              trout coming in and out of river systems. I should like to hear
              the Minister state clearly what the current position is on the
              regulation of sea fisheries for environmental purposes, and why it
              is considered necessary to regulate them. There is still much work
              for us in this area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have come under international pressure,
              particularly from countries such as Iceland, which has fished
              north Atlantic salmon stocks and would dearly love to do so again.
              It has not, however, because of the environmental impact it was
              having. It seems odd, therefore, that local countries will
              continue to fish those stocks. We need to address the emergent
              problem of fishing north Atlantic stocks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this stage of the Bill and look
              forward to its next stage.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s comments, but does
              she have the staff to police this?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a welcome boost for tourism and agri-tourism.
              There is a great opportunity for Northern Ireland if we can bring
              our waterways up to standard and protect them — especially for
              fishing — as we have a great shoreline. If we can get our part
              right, the quality and image that will be put forward across
              tourism will be admired. We have such a bad image. We have to
              improve the image of our fishing. The opportunities are tremendous
              but I am worried about whether the Minister has the staff to
              police this.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By and large, we endorse the amendments to the
              Bill. There are a couple of concerns, specifically about clause 1,
              which relates to the foreshore. Many people are concerned about
              the dredging taking place in Strangford Lough, which has had a
              detrimental effect. It has led to erosion. Many refer to it as the
              rape of Strangford Lough. We are all aware that Strangford Lough
              is of international environmental importance. The fact that there
              are some changes in the Bill to ensure that the dredging and
              scraping of the foreshore to get the shellfish is discontinued is
              to be welcomed. At the same time, we have to get a balance between
              the environment and local fishing needs and interests. We look for
              assurance from the Minister that what we have today is the correct
              balance — that environmental interests do not override fishing
              interests.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also make the Minister aware that,
              along with mechanical dredging, we have people in the Ards and
              south Down areas who regard the harvesting of shellfish as a
              traditional job they have done over many years. Can the Minister
              assure those people that they will still be able to do that? In
              some cases, those people are in the low wage bracket and they
              supplement their income by taking some shellfish. This is fine, as
              long as the shellfish population is there to sustain it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department has also issued a booklet
              entitled ‘Intertidal Zone Shell-Fish Harvesting’, which I
              understand has been withdrawn. Some fishing bodies are concerned
              that they have not been consulted on the matter. We want to find
              out about that today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In clause 3 we have an example of changes that
              need to be made. The Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee recently
              asked for a change of wording. That change is important because
              &quot;to sell, purchase or knowingly have in their
              possession&quot; would be the new interpretation. If that were the
              case, it would prevent circumstances where people have found
              themselves in possession of the spawn or the fry through no fault
              of their own. Spawn are small and worm-like, and able to get into
              and out of fish farms.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the rewording of clause 7 to refer to
              reinstatement rather than restocking. That is very important.
              Restocking is a superficial way of addressing the wrong that has
              taken place. Just putting more fish in does not get us back to
              where we were. Reinstatement means that the habitat will be put
              back in order, so as to sustain the reintroduced fish.
              Reinstatement means the habitat, the banks, the water itself and
              the contributing waters as well. Those are all very important.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pollution is one of our greatest problems. My
              own Committee is taking submissions at the moment, and each and
              every group that comes forward highlights pollution as one of its
              greatest concerns. We must also look at policing. It is not just a
              matter of having the words and having the legislation and having
              it all down on paper. We must have the manpower or the womanpower
              to enforce it. Who will police it? Will staff be made available to
              ensure that polluted waters are reinstated and those responsible
              are made amenable?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 5 relates to the power of the board to
              make by-laws. That is a welcome introduction that will go some way
              to addressing what is a very dear issue to the people in North
              Antrim, and indeed to fishermen throughout the Province, and that
              is the stock of salmon. I hope that that will ensure that our
              stock of salmon will be enhanced and increased. That is important.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Culture, Arts and
              Leisure Committee (Mrs Nelis): </b>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann
              Comhairle. I welcome the Bill. I am certain that it will make some
              impact on the disastrous state of our inland waterways, loughs and
              seas. As Mr ONeill said, the Committee is currently inquiring into
              the issue of fisheries. Most of those who have given evidence
              paint a dismal picture of the difficulties facing our anglers and
              those who are trying to maintain the environment and the purity of
              our water.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome that part of the Bill that addresses
              the issue of polluted waters, but we need more and we need it
              urgently. Witnesses from various angling clubs have told us that
              the inland waterways are polluted almost beyond recovery.
              Pollution is threatening the entire marine life of the rivers. We
              hear every week of various pollution incidents, whether caused by
              farmers, gravel extractors, hydroelectric schemes or irresponsible
              people. Salmon stocks — fish stocks in general — have been so
              seriously depleted that one wonders whether legislation at this
              stage will be enough to address the very serious state of our
              rivers and inland waterways.</p>

              benefit to Members if you were to explain why the Minister of
              Agriculture is making legislation for the Department of Culture,
              Arts and Leisure. I hope that it is not a question of one

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the issue of fishing, I suspect that the
              Departments will be particularly careful about the question of
              &quot;poaching&quot;. This Bill clearly has elements relating to
              the responsibilities of both the Department of Agriculture and
              Rural Development and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.
              The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development explained that
              she would be opening the Second Reading debate while the Minister
              of Culture, Arts and Leisure would make the winding-up speech. It
              would be particularly surprising, given the Member’s party, if
              he were to object to co-operation between the two Ministers.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not sure how to follow that one. This is a
              serious problem, because these issues affect both Departments. It
              will not be easy for those of us on the Agriculture and Rural
              Development Committee to deal competently with further stages of
              this legislation when our Colleagues in Culture, Arts and Leisure
              have the expertise in certain aspects of it. Despite reservations,
              I give a broad welcome to the principle of the Bill. It is clear
              that most of the proposed measures are overdue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister highlighted the fact that
              foreshore protection has been part of legislation in Great Britain
              for five years. However, Strangford Lough, which is supposedly
              protected to the highest UK and European standards, has been
              subjected to a kind of tractor trawling operation through a site
              of special scientific interest and a Ramsar site in the interests
              of dredging up shellfish. This must be stopped, and stopped
              speedily.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have some sympathy with the view expressed by
              Mr&nbsp;Shannon about people who traditionally farmed for
              shellfish in that area. However, I do not see how driving a
              tractor and dredging up everything in sight can be described as a
              traditional fishing method. Clause&nbsp;3, which refers to the
              protection of spawning beds, is clearly necessary, although
              Mr&nbsp;ONeill has highlighted the problem of potentially alien
              species being introduced.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to ask questions later, in relation to
              salmon roe, about what measures will be taken to prevent alien
              species being introduced to inappropriate places. That falls
              within the area of responsibility of both Departments.
              Clause&nbsp;7 — which stresses reinstatement rather than
              restocking — is a laudable aspiration, although I wonder how it
              will be carried out. Considering all the micro-flora and
              micro-fauna required to fully restock a river, it seems that to
              merely insert a clause in a Bill saying that people — who may go
              bankrupt in the meantime — can be charged for the necessary cost
              of reinstatement, is a little naive. That will not solve the
              problems. To suggest that this can be done at minimal cost to the
              public purse is also somewhat naive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do the two Departments feel that the powers
              given to them under the proposed clause&nbsp;7 will be adequate?
              In the light of it, how do they propose to go about the restocking
              and the full reinstatement? It is clear that the powers of the
              Fisheries Conservancy Board are limited. We welcome clause&nbsp;5,
              which will increase those powers, but it impinges on the resources
              that I have mentioned. As the Minister mentioned, there is also
              the issue of how similar powers will be applied to the Foyle and
              Carlingford systems. We need to ensure that the whole of Northern
              Ireland — indeed, the whole island — is given protection at
              the same level. There are some detailed questions to be asked, but
              I welcome the Bill in principle.</p>

              raised as a point of order by his Colleague. I remind the House
              that, under Standing Orders, if a Committee is dealing with a
              matter that is clearly also a matter of interest to another
              Committee, there is a requirement to consult. Precisely how to do
              that in the conduct of the Committee Stage of the Bill is not an
              easy matter. It is much more straightforward in terms of
              investigation. Nevertheless, the requirement for consultation is
              there. I am sure that this will be undertaken by the Committee on
              which the Member sits.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Wilson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may be advisable for me to declare an
              interest, as Members are looking at a piece of legislation where
              it could be argued by some that my views represent those of
              angling organisations and pressure groups. I welcome the Bill, and
              I see nothing in it that concerns me a great deal. However, there
              are two matters that I would like to refer to.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I refer to clause&nbsp;3. This clause
              provides the Fisheries Conservancy Board with powers to control
              the removal of material from rivers by making it an offence to
              remove material from the bed of a river without their prior
              consent. Does this apply to Drainage Division, which over the
              years — and some might say that it is still happening — has
              canalised our rivers? This has left them with 45º banks that
              almost require anglers to have one long leg and one short one to
              fish them. It has removed riverside vegetation, flora and fauna,
              and left the rivers in a terrible state. If Drainage Division does
              not comply, will it be fined? That is a very interesting question.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Referring to clause 5, all the angling media
              forecast that salmon tagging would be introduced over a year ago
              when the Department and the Fisheries Conservancy Board looked at
              the issue. However, it was discovered that the Fisheries
              Conservancy Board did not have the funds to introduce salmon
              tagging. I believe that the Chairperson of the Culture, Arts and
              Leisure Committee will agree with me that through our work, and
              through the representations made to us, people are becoming
              increasingly aware that the Fisheries Conservancy Board is
              seriously underfunded.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How can the Fisheries Conservancy Board be
              expected to take on the administration of the tagging scheme —
              welcome though it is — without serious consideration being given
              to increasing its funding?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague, Mr&nbsp;ONeill, sought
              clarification on the definition of foreshore boundaries. I would
              also welcome such clarification. Can the Minister advise the
              Assembly on the current position regarding the regulation of
              fishing on the foreshore? Are any changes anticipated that will
              remove local councils’ custodial interest in the foreshores?
              Under the current legislation this gives the Minister of
              Environment an ongoing role. I am not trying to introduce yet
              another Minister to the fray.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I strongly support the overall purpose of this
              Bill. Before coming to the Assembly I worked for the National
              Trust. That organisation campaigned vigorously for this
              legislation because the commercial exploitation of wild shellfish
              was having an extremely detrimental impact on the ecology of
              Strangford Lough. Indeed, it had almost become an industrial
              activity. We can all draw a clear distinction between someone with
              a bucket and spade digging up a few shellfish on a Saturday
              afternoon to take them home to eat, and the harvesting of tonnes
              of molluscs as occurred on Strangford Lough.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What was going on was totally unsustainable,
              not only in terms of its detrimental impact on the wildlife but
              eventually on the fish stock, which would be exhausted. Therefore
              the individuals who were carrying out this activity were sowing
              the seeds of their own destruction. It must be remembered that
              Strangford Lough, as everyone in the Chamber knows, is an area of
              special scientific interest; a Ramsar site; an area of outstanding
              natural beauty; and a marine nature reserve. Large portions of it
              are national nature reserves. This area has one of the highest
              possible designations as far as wildlife conservation is
              concerned. An activity that was leading to the destruction of the
              mudflats could not be allowed to continue, because the mudflats
              are vital for the fish population. They are also vitally important
              feeding grounds for species such as Brent geese, wigeon, bartailed
              godwit and many other species for which Strangford Lough is either
              internationally or nationally important. I therefore strongly
              welcome the speed with which this Bill has been brought forward
              and the support that it has received.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The enactment will be vital. It must be done
              forcefully and very clearly. The regulations that are introduced
              after the passage of the Bill will have to be looked at very
              carefully. Officials from the Department must have clear authority
              to step in and prevent this destructive activity. Therefore we
              will be watching very carefully to see what happens.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also ask the Department to look at some other
              activities in areas such as Strangford Lough and Lough Foyle which
              are having a very detrimental impact on the ecology. One issue is
              sand removal. Currently there seems to be no control whatsoever of
              the removal of sand from beaches in the Province.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another issue is bait digging. Here you can
              have a situation where someone like the hon Member for South
              Antrim, Mr Jim Wilson, goes down once a year with a shovel and a
              plastic bucket to Larne Lough and digs a few worms to use for
              fishing. Apart from the animal welfare aspects of what happens to
              the worms, that activity in itself has no real impact on the
              environment. However, from my experience of Belfast Lough, bait
              digging seems to be happening on a very large scale. I suspect
              that some of that is commercial and that it is being sold on to
              other fishermen. We need to look at whether that should be
              controlled.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also note that a large proportion of
              Whitepark Bay on the north Antrim coast is being carted away on
              the back of lorries as the sand is extracted and sold
              commercially. So there are other aspects of the marine environment
              that give cause for concern and need to be looked at as a matter
              of urgency.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any sensible person would also strongly support
              the replacing in the Fisheries Act (Northern&nbsp;Ireland) 1966 of
              the word &quot;restocking&quot; with &quot;reinstatement&quot;.
              Time after time the angling bodies that have contacted me have
              made the point that the fines handed out by the courts for
              instances of pollution are totally inadequate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The FCB is very diligent in tracing the people
              responsible, but when they are brought to court they are fined
              £200 or £400, even though they may have done tens of thousands
              of pounds’ worth of damage to the fisheries of that water. If
              they knew that they would not only have to restock the river or
              the lake but also to reinstate it to what it was before the
              incident occurred, that would act as a major deterrent to those
              carrying out that activity. We need to send out a clear message
              that if you pollute you are liable to pay a substantial amount of
              money and will be expected to bring that river back to the
              condition it was in before you allowed the silage, oil or
              pesticides into the water. That could only be good news.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the FCB have the staffing and resources to
              implement this legislation? I am not certain to which Minister I
              am putting my question — we are in one of those difficult
              situations. Anyway, I would like an assurance that the extra
              resources will be given to the FCB to police this legislation and
              to ensure reinstatement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much time and effort will have to be put into
              reinstatement as opposed to restocking. With restocking, if the
              perpetrator pays for a specified number of fish to be put back
              into the river he has carried out his obligations under the 1966
              Act. Under this new legislation — and it is very welcome — the
              situation will have to be monitored by scientists to ensure that
              the river is returned to its original condition. That is a totally
              different situation — I was going to say &quot;kettle of
              fish&quot;, but maybe that is not appropriate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have all had very serious incidents of
              pollution in our constituencies. I can think of recent instances
              on the Upper Bann, the Moyola and the Lagan where, clearly, if
              this legislation had been enacted, a major scheme would have had
              to be carried out. Therefore can the Minister tell us what extra
              resources have been made available?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apart from those few minor points, this
              legislation is extremely welcome.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Cheann Comhairle, go raibh maith agat. I
              broadly welcome the Bill, and I hope that it will have a
              beneficial impact.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The controls that will be beneficial to habitat
              are welcome, as is the flexibility regarding disabled people —
              and maybe local people have often been left out regarding fishing
              in their own indigenous areas. Environmental protection of
              foreshores, habitat and wildlife is also a welcome benefit. I have
              some concerns about the shellfish and the salmon roe trading. That
              seems to be of benefit to a few — or is it of greater benefit?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The removal of vast amounts of sand from
              habitats in Lough Neagh and such places as Ballyronan by absentee
              landlords is another issue that has been mentioned to me. Local
              people are concerned about the effect that will have on the
              habitat of the eel population.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 7 relates to pollution regulations
              extending to reinstatement. This is a good thing, because those
              who are destroying the local habitat — and it is going on at a
              phenomenal rate each year — deserve more than a fine. Government
              bodies and agencies have also been responsible for a sizeable
              amount of river pollution — especially of inland clear-water
              rivers — year after year, but they have Crown immunity. However,
              farmers are often cited as the only cause of pollution in most
              areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the pollution caused by the
              attempts of vested interests to poison our drinking water through
              the addition of fluoride. That has been attempted in all council
              areas in the Six Counties but was turned down. I would not want to
              see that happening in the future. Fluoride is supposed to be more
              toxic than lead.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards reducing pollution, the inadequate
              sewerage systems in towns and over-developed areas also contribute
              to the pollution problem. Therefore the sewerage system is another
              issue that must be addressed. A holistic approach to the issue of
              pollution is required, taking in households, Government
              Departments and agriculture. It is not about laying blame at one
              sector; it is about going forward with anglers and local people so
              that they can have better waterways.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Cheann Comhairle, I am addressing the same
              issue as my Colleague Mr&nbsp;McHugh — pollution as it relates
              to clause 7. One of the big problems in a lot of rural areas has
              been that Government agencies are not prosecuted for causing
              pollution. Does the Minister envisage that, particularly as
              regards the Department of Agriculture and Rural Department, there
              will be some change in attitude to this? It is a bad situation
              that various agencies and departments seek immunity instead of
              facing up to their responsibilities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A farmer can be fined for polluting a river but
              the Department can pollute it. In Coalisland, there was a case in
              which the Water Service polluted a local river. The river had just
              been completely restocked and reinstated by Government grants, and
              then the Department was responsible for polluting it. There needs
              to be a change of attitude. Owing to immunity, the Departments and
              their officials who are responsible for pollution are escaping
              prosecution. The legislation needs to be strengthened in relation
              to pollution and reinstatement.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure
              (Mr&nbsp;McGimpsey): </b>I thank the Members for their interest in
              the debate. Clearly, the provisions represent important and
              necessary changes. There is great interest in this matter, as has
              been demonstrated by the number of questions and points raised. I
              will try to deal with all of them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Bill came through prior to devolution,
              which is why it cuts across two Departments — the Department of
              Agriculture and Rural Development and the Department of Culture,
              Arts and Leisure. I suspect that this will not be the last time
              Members will see two Ministers introducing a Bill.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill referred to pollution, the tagging
              scheme, clause 7, and the provisions for reinstatement. I know he
              welcomed the tagging scheme. As for reinstatement, Members will be
              aware that under the 1966&nbsp;Act, when there has been a fish
              kill the polluter, whoever that may be, is responsible for
              restocking. Under the new Bill the polluter will now be
              responsible for restocking the entire environment of the
              particular section of waterway affected with both flora and fauna.
              This is very important, because if you kill the ecosystem that the
              fish lives in, simply restocking fish is clearly not sufficient.
              This is an important power that the Fisheries Conservancy Board
              will have.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some work is being done on retention of native
              fish stocks. For example, Queen’s University is undertaking
              genetic mapping of native trout and salmon. One area where that is
              active is Lough&nbsp;Erne. Genetically pure Lough&nbsp;Erne brown
              trout are being bred in a hatchery at Marble Arch. That is the
              only example that I am currently aware of, although I will look at
              the issue and see if there are any more. It is difficult for any
              of us to say what &quot;genetically pure&quot; means, but genetic
              mapping is going on at the minute. The example from
              Marble&nbsp;Arch caves is the only one I am aware of.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the regulation of sea fisheries for
              environmental purposes, we are committed to adopting the
              precautionary approach to salmon management. We have introduced a
              salmon management plan which takes account of the scientific
              status of the salmon stocks. Mr&nbsp;Savage asked whether the
              authorities have the funds to enforce the regulations. The
              Fisheries Conservancy Board — and a number of Members have
              mentioned this — does not have the funds to manage its current
              activities. These regulations will result in extra activities. I
              have bid for extra funding in the 2000 spending round. It is not a
              huge amount of money. This is a Department where small amounts of
              money can produce big outputs. This is no exception. Currently the
              Fisheries Conservancy Board does not have the funds. We are taking
              on the powers for the board to enforce this, but there will be a
              revenue consequence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill does not in any way interfere with the
              public right to shellfish extraction that Mr&nbsp;Shannon referred
              to — the private, traditional right that has been exercised in
              Strangford Lough, for example, where people will go down with a
              bucket and spade and extract some cockles. We are looking to deal
              with mechanical extraction. As my Colleague said, we estimate that
              in 1998 about 4&nbsp;tonnes of material per day was being
              extracted from Strangford Lough over a four-week period. That is a
              very substantial amount. That is the only occurrence that we are
              aware of at the moment, but we must regulate this because it has a
              knock-on effect. It knocks out the balance of the ecosystem. It is
              important that that is maintained and regulated. That is what this
              measure is designed to do.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of enforcement, the Department of
              Agriculture is content that it has adequate resources to enforce
              the regulations in relation to the foreshore. The foreshore is the
              area between high tide and low tide marks. The Department of
              Agriculture is responsible for that. The Department of Culture,
              Arts and Leisure is responsible for fresh water. The Fisheries
              Conservancy Board has inadequate resources, but the Department of
              Agriculture is content that it has adequate resources.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Shannon also asked whether there would
              be an opportunity to consider amendments later. Of course that
              will happen. Only the general principles of the Bill are under
              discussion here. The Member will have an opportunity to see
              further details in due course.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Ford asked about the responsibilities
              of the two Departments and how the Agriculture Committee relates
              to the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee. The Agriculture
              Committee will deal with agricultural responsibilities under the
              Bill. Committees may invite members of other Committees or have a
              joint meeting of Committees if necessary. That is an example of us
              learning to do what we have all talked about for many years. We
              are learning that this is a process of joined-up government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Ford also asked about the Fisheries
              Conservancy Board, restocking and reinstatement. I have already
              dealt with that.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.45 am</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding steps being taken to introduce alien
              species, the Department is not doing that. A licence is required.
              For example, Members may note that the Department has allowed the
              introduction of carp to a lake outside Banbridge. That requires
              specific approval because carp is not a native fish. Alien fish do
              from time to time get in, but it is not something that the
              Department would be looking to take forward officially.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Jim&nbsp;Wilson asked whether the
              regulations would apply to the Drainage Division of the Department
              of Agriculture. As a Government agency it has Crown exemption, but
              we would expect it to observe the spirit of these proposals. I am
              waiting for a response from Drainage Division. There are two
              competing requirements here. One is to maintain the environment of
              the rivers, and the other is to ensure adequate drainage. Some
              rivers are designated as drainage rivers, and if Drainage Division
              does not carry out its work then areas of the countryside will be
              liable to flooding. Drainage Division has been responsible for
              seriously altering the natural state of the rivers. This has also
              seriously altered the ecology of the rivers and upset the
              environmental balance of the riverbanks and riverbeds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Wilson also referred to salmon tagging
              and whether the Fisheries Conservancy Board has sufficient
              resources. I have already referred to the Fisheries Conservancy
              Board. It does not have sufficient resources for salmon tagging,
              any more than it has sufficient resources for enforcing the
              pollution measures. I am aware of that. I am bidding for more
              resources. Currently we are empowering the Fisheries Conservancy
              Board. The revenue consequences will be dealt with, and that will
              allow these measures to be taken forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think I have covered most of the points that
              have been raised. Members will forgive me if I have missed some of
              them. Mr&nbsp;McHugh and Mr&nbsp;Molloy made points about
              pollution. I am well aware of that problem. Agencies and
              Departments do pollute on occasion. The Water Service has a case
              to answer there in terms of the occasional ineffectiveness of the
              sewerage and drainage systems. However, it appears that at least
              50% of pollution incidents have an agricultural source. For
              example, officials have told me that last year they took
              91&nbsp;dead sheep out of the river at the Bushmills fish station.
              Farmers had been throwing dead sheep into the water. That is an
              example of pollution that we are aware of. It is often difficult
              to discover who the polluters are. It can also be difficult to
              discover areas of pollution because one of the means of detection
              is dead fish floating on the surface of the river, and if the
              river is badly polluted it will not support fish. If pollution
              occurs, there are no fish to die and come to the surface to give
              the evidence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I conclude by thanking Members for their
              contributions to the debate, and support the motion moved by the
              Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You are absolutely right on both counts —
              that we said we did not want to take points of order, and that we
              are recidivists. We will, having returned from the summer recess,
              return to our former good ways, as, I trust, will the rest of the

              House to take points of order, because it sometimes clarifies
              matters in a helpful way, though points of order in this House
              rarely tend to do that. We will try to keep alert to those which
              do.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly expresses its concern at the
              escalating price of fuel and calls on the Chancellor of the
              Exchequer to take measures to lessen the impact of high fuel costs
              on the economic well-being of Northern Ireland and its people, and
              to encourage other EU member states to bring their tax on fuel
              into line with that of neighbouring countries to allow fair
              competition and to discourage the illegal transportation of fuel
              across national boundaries.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Nigel Dodds for agreeing to sponsor
              this motion along with me. I would also like to thank my Ulster
              Unionist Assembly Colleague Danny Kennedy, who worked with me on
              my original motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I first discussed the possibility of a debate
              two weeks ago. Since then the issue of high fuel taxes has been
              driven to the top of the United Kingdom’s national political
              agenda. I am pleased that fuel distribution has resumed in Great
              Britain and that the protestors have ended their campaign,
              retaining the moral high ground and with public opinion on their
              side. The Labour Government appears to be in listening mode now.
              Neither the Labour Government nor Labour MPs have the same
              susceptibility to pressure here in Northern Ireland. Disruption to
              the economy was estimated to be costing £250 million per day and
              would eventually have brought the country to its knees. Given this
              and our own economic background, it would be neither appropriate
              nor effective to replicate such action in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the work of the fuel crisis group,
              which was hastily formed last week. I see some of its members in
              the Gallery today. The group represents a wide spectrum of
              Northern Ireland industry, including CBI Northern Ireland, the
              Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Federation
              of Small Businesses, the Petrol Retailers Association, the Oil
              Promotion Federation, the Road Haulage Association, the Freight
              Transport Association, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, the Northern
              Ireland Fishermen’s Federation and fish producers’
              organisations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that this debate, together with lobbying
              and the media event that I understand is being organised outside,
              will help focus our discontent about high fuel costs within
              Northern Ireland. I strongly support the view that there should be
              no traffic disruptions in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the United Kingdom, petrol and diesel are
              supplied at competitive prices, before tax, compared to those in
              other European countries. Our Chancellor then applies the highest
              fuel taxes of any country in the European Union. We end up paying
              the highest fuel costs in the EU. Including VAT, tax accounts for
              some 75% of pump prices. Is it any wonder that the electorate does
              not believe Mr Blair when he tries to blame others for the high
              cost of fuel?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members have pointed out that fuel tax is
              a reserved matter, but this debate provides a democratic outlet
              for discussion within Northern Ireland. Furthermore, we might be
              able to contribute to the change that is starting to happen in the
              rest of the United Kingdom. This same motion could very easily be
              put before the Welsh Assembly or the Scottish Parliament. That
              would build pressure on Labour Back-Benchers. I have received
              cross-party support in the Assembly. Should the motion be passed,
              I intend to seek support from other devolved bodies. This would
              undoubtedly have some effect.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chief Whip of the Ulster Unionist Party in
              Westminster, Roy Beggs MP, has confirmed that he will seek support
              for an early-day motion on this issue. The campaign may build from
              the regional Assemblies, gather cross-party support at Westminster
              and put pressure on the Government. It is important that we
              continue to add to this pressure to reduce the high fuel tax that
              distorts trade in Northern Ireland and encourages smuggling in
              this part of the United Kingdom. The Department of Environment may
              have some role to play. I have spoken to the Minister, Mr Foster,
              and some members of the departmental Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been working on this issue for over a
              year. I highlighted the fact that the Department of Environment,
              which licenses road hauliers in Northern Ireland, had never
              revoked a licence as a result of smuggling.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We wish to ensure that there is fair
              competition in Northern Ireland, and I understand that the
              Department has the power to consider the standing and reputation
              of an operator when issuing a licence. It would be in order to
              reassess whether some operators who have been caught smuggling
              should be allowed to trade legitimately in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a wider issue, linkage between the various
              Departments is necessary. At present, if a haulier is caught
              smuggling, no record is made of his company’s involvement and
              nothing appears on his licence, provided that the fine is quickly
              paid, and often it is paid in cash. The Departments need to liase
              with Customs and Excise, which should pass such information on.
              The Committee should also be dealing with this issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Driving around Northern Ireland, I occasionally
              notice signposts advertising diesel at exceptionally low prices,
              lower than our retailers can even buy it at. Is greater
              enforcement needed of the legislation on the licensing of
              retailers? There are safety and environmental issues involved as
              well as the problem of the illegal trading of fuel smuggled into
              Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As fuel becomes prohibitively expensive, we all
              avoid unnecessary journeys, but protecting the environment is a
              Europe-wide — indeed, a global — issue. If fuel pricing is to
              be used to protect the environment, such a policy must also be
              adopted by our neighbouring European states, and this point is
              reflected in the motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, pricing differentials which encourage
              drivers to travel considerable distances needlessly to buy cheaper
              fuel is wasting the Earth’s resources, unnecessarily damaging
              the environment and contributing to traffic congestion. Pricing
              differentials also encourage smugglers to transport fuel tanks
              outside our natural port hinterland, which wastes precious
              hydrocarbon fuel. It is very expensive to carry heavy goods any
              considerable distance by road, whether from Cork or from Dublin
              — other areas from which fuel is imported to Northern Ireland.
              It is a waste of resources for smugglers to use fuel to travel
              that extra distance. It is in the interests of the economy that
              fuel should be efficiently distributed from the port of Belfast to
              our natural hinterland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pricing differentials also encourage smuggling
              by unsafe home-made fuel transporters, which put both the public
              and the environment at risk. This was highlighted about a year ago
              when a container was found in the Banbridge area. It was a
              curtain-sided vehicle carrying a man-made steel tank which
              contained illegal fuel. The tank was badly constructed, the
              vehicle was overloaded, and the brakes went on fire.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I asked an environmentalist to examine the
              motion carefully, as it has the potential to be both
              environmentally neutral and beneficial. Pollution must be
              addressed evenly and at a European level; the burden must not
              simply be placed on British taxpayers here in Northern Ireland.
              There is no environmental benefit to be gained from the current
              situation in which vehicles on our roads are burning cheap diesel,
              sourced from other European countries, to the disadvantage of
              local hauliers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The high cost of fuel, which is out of line
              with the cost to our European competitors, is having a detrimental
              effect on the Northern Ireland economy and the welfare of the
              citizens of this part of the United Kingdom. I will attempt to
              highlight some of the problems caused to our economy, to our
              manufacturers, retailers, hauliers, small businesses, farmers,
              rural communities and fishermen.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the past 10&nbsp;years, the Chancellor of
              the Exchequer has increased duties on unleaded petrol by 150·5%
              from 19·49p per litre to 48·82p per litre. Diesel has been
              similarly affected.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, in the Irish Republic — our
              immediate European neighbour — duty in March was only 29·45p
              per litre and 25·62p per litre respectively. High fuel costs add
              to distribution costs, which must be added to the price of
              products. This affects every business in Northern Ireland. Our
              products are becoming less competitive and jobs are being lost. As
              we are a peripheral part of the European Union and of the United
              Kingdom, the cost of haulage is more significant to the people of
              Northern Ireland than to those in many other parts of the European
              Union. We are doubly disadvantaged.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland there is no real
              alternative to the road haulage industry. How else can a container
              be moved from the docks in Larne, Belfast, Warrenpoint or
              Londonderry to an industrial estate? Rail transport is more
              efficient for longer distances, but the relatively short distances
              from our ports make it impractical. Diesel accounts for 25% to 40%
              of hauliers’ operating costs and so can determine profitability.
              High fuel costs in Northern Ireland only encourage drivers and
              hauliers to obtain cheaper fuel.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vehicle excise duty also discriminates against
              hauliers here. A 40-tonne articulated lorry is currently charged
              £3,950 per year for road tax, while hauliers from the Republic of
              Ireland — with whom our drivers must compete and who can travel
              on our roads freely as part of the European Union — are paying
              only £1,250 to their Government. This differential is forcing
              Northern Ireland hauliers out of business and causing others to
              register in the Republic of Ireland. This has no environmental
              gain and simply exports Northern Ireland jobs and businesses.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Petrol Retailers Association has
              highlighted the difficulties being faced by its members.
              Deliveries of forecourt supplies have dramatically reduced over
              the past six years, down 52·79% in petrol deliveries and 41·56%
              in diesel deliveries. To appreciate the scale of the problem it
              must be remembered that since 1994 there has been a 21% increase
              in the number of registered vehicles in Northern Ireland. Where is
              all the extra fuel coming from?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The decline is worsening. According to the
              latest figures published by the Institute of Petroleum, in the
              first quarter of this year there was a 45·7% decline in
              deliveries of diesel into Northern Ireland compared to the first
              quarter of 1999, and an overall 33·9% decline in oil deliveries.
              Huge tonnages of fuel must be winding across border roads.
              Potentially a quarter of a million&nbsp;tonnes of oil products
              during the first quarter of this year, when compared to last year,
              have come by other means. With the approximate halving of turnover
              by volume, it is not surprising that many petrol stations in
              Northern Ireland have been closing. This loss of turnover is
              estimated to be costing the British taxpayer £310&nbsp;million
              per annum as excise duty is not being paid to the British
              Exchequer.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Sir John Gorman] in the
              Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rural community in Northern Ireland, along
              with farmers and fishermen, is already struggling with reductions
              in earnings. The additional fuel costs add to overheads and cause
              difficulties to the rural economy by adding further transportation
              costs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What can the Government do? Following the
              increase in world oil prices, North&nbsp;Sea oil revenue has
              contributed billions of extra pounds to exchequer funds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recently received advice from a local member
              of the Federation of Small Businesses that economic research shows
              that a cut of up to 8p per litre would have no implication for the
              Exchequer because of the additional revenue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also draw attention to comments in paragraph
              62 of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee report published on
              29 July 1999:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;There is no doubt that the differential
              in fuel prices, across the land border in the island of Ireland,
              has serious consequences for fuel supplies and road hauliers. It
              is a wide problem, in that, besides distorting trading patterns,
              it appears to have become a means of funding for paramilitaries
              and racketeers. It is therefore damaging the social fabric of
              Northern Ireland.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This issue goes much further than our retailers
              and road hauliers. It is one which the Assembly will have to
              address through its Committees, and I encourage Members to apply
              pressure to the Secretary of State and the British Cabinet.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I advise the Assembly of a comment in paragraph
              57 of the report, under the heading &quot;Recommendations&quot;:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Committee recommends that Government

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That concept is contained in the motion. The

              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It may be that at a European level a
              consensus might emerge on measures to mitigate the impact of road
              fuel duty and the price differentials between Member States which
              are both effective and consistent with the principles of the
              Single Market.&quot;</p>

              operators’ licences if they are found to be smuggling. That is
              something our Minister can do. I urge the Department to
              investigate suggestions made by the Select Committee that we
              should be examining the viability of a licensing system for all
              fuel retailers in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have spoken to the Minister, Mr Foster, and

              myself through questions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current high cost of fuel is out of line
              with those of our European competitors and is clearly affecting
              our economic well-being. I urge the Members to support the motion.</p>

              for which this Assembly or any Member has any responsibility. That
              has not stopped politicians from Northern Ireland raising such
              issues in the past, and I am sure that it will not stop us in the
              future. Although responsibility lies with the Chancellor of the
              Exchequer and the Government at Westminster, it is extremely
              important that we should be having this debate and have this

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the Chancellor and the
              Prime Minister hear directly and clearly from the elected Members
              of this Assembly, on behalf of all the people in Northern Ireland,
              how strongly we feel about the situation regarding high duty and
              taxes on fuel and how that affects this part of the United
              Kingdom.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While, thankfully, we did not suffer from the
              protests that were held across the rest of the United Kingdom,
              that should not disguise the fact that in Northern Ireland we are
              worse off in terms of the impact of high fuel costs on our people
              and economy. As Mr&nbsp;Beggs mentioned, the fact that the
              Northern Ireland fuel crisis group has been set up quickly and has
              been very active indicates just how important this issue is for
              business, trade and other sectors of the economy in Northern
              Ireland. Representatives have been extensively lobbying the
              parties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation is worse here because we have
              higher fuel prices than other parts of the United Kingdom. The
              United Kingdom as a whole has the highest fuel prices in the
              developed world. For petrol, it is 10p per litre more than in the
              next-highest country, which is France. We in Northern Ireland, as
              many of our newspapers have shown over the years, are in many
              cases paying higher prices than the average in many other parts of
              the United Kingdom.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chancellor explained that oil prices had
              gone up to $35 a barrel, and the blame was being put on the
              Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the oil
              producers. However, the real villain is the Chancellor. The real
              villain is the taxman. Three quarters of the price of a litre of
              fuel is being handed over to the Treasury.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Added to the fact that we have such a high rate
              of taxation in the UK, we have the scandal of double taxation. For
              each litre of fuel, 48·8p goes in excise duty. Value added tax
              (VAT) is added not only to the cost of the fuel but to the duty as
              well. VAT is being levied on the cost of the fuel and the excise
              duty. You do not have to be a mastermind to work out that that is
              adding between 7p and 8p per litre to the price of fuel. It is a
              tax on tax and it is something that I always understood was
              anathema as far as taxation policy is concerned. Clearly, the
              Chancellor should do something about that iniquity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps I am a bit old-fashioned, but one
              problem is that for many of us, who are used to dealing in price
              per gallon, the price per litre actually disguises the real rise
              in price. We are almost at £4 per gallon. Some have said we are
              heading towards five pounds per gallon. When it is put in terms of
              price per litre it does not seem so bad — 2p on a litre of
              petrol. However, that translates into almost 10p per gallon. Every
              time prices go up, you see the real cost of fuel in Northern
              Ireland and the UK.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other major problem already highlighted is
              that we have a land boundary with another member state of the
              European Union. Cheaper fuel is available in the Irish Republic
              because of lower tax and duty rates and also because of the
              differential in the currency valuations.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that the Member is
              highlighting the particular difficulties faced by our petrol
              retailers. More than 60&nbsp;petrol stations have already closed
              and many are facing closure. Does he agree that unless
              Her&nbsp;Majesty’s Government address this issue properly they
              will be creating an exclusion zone for petrol stations within our
              own border?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is absolutely right, and I am sure
              that this issue will be highlighted by other Members. I understand
              that the most recent figures show that petrol sales by Northern
              Ireland retailers are down 42% on last year. That is a staggering
              figure that illustrates the real problem for petrol retailers,
              particularly in border areas, where traders are finding it
              impossible to continue to trade.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The increases in duty and taxes over the last
              decade reinforce the point. Petrol duty in the Irish Republic
              increased by 6% over that period, whereas in Northern Ireland it
              rose by 150%. Between 1990 and 2000, diesel increased by 15% in
              the Irish Republic, but in Northern Ireland it rose by 157%, so
              diesel now costs 83% more in Northern Ireland than it does in the
              Republic. The result of this is that business people are going
              southwards to obtain cheaper fuel, jobs are being lost and revenue
              is being lost to the exchequer. We also have the very serious
              problem of the smuggling that is lining the pockets of
              paramilitary groups, criminal groups and others.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While many of us feel that more could and
              should be done to tackle the problem in terms of Customs and
              Excise and police resources, clearly we will always have the
              problem while we have this massive cost differential. Therefore
              the solution lies with the Chancellor, who should take steps to do
              something about these tax differentials.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The University of Ulster report of February
              2000, which I have looked at, indicates that 3,000 to 6,000 jobs
              have already been lost in Northern Ireland because of this
              problem, with revenue of up to £100 million having gone
              southward. While we have a differential of 23p per litre on petrol
              and 29p per litre on diesel, there is no doubt that the problem is
              going to get worse.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs mentioned that we are a peripheral
              part of the United Kingdom and of Europe. We are therefore highly
              dependent on road transport and face higher transport costs. The
              announcement that a new working party is being set up in the Irish
              Republic by the Irish Prime Minister to look at the rates of
              excise duty in the South will send alarm bells ringing in Northern
              Ireland, because the problem that is bad now has the potential to
              get even worse.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Chancellor of the Exchequer is looking
              at the question of tax he will have to bear in mind the impact his
              tax policy will have on the regions. He cannot simply ignore the
              fact that we in Northern Ireland face the problem of sharing a
              land boundary — a problem which does not arise in England,
              Scotland or Wales. As a result of these problems, as has already
              been mentioned, our haulage industry also faces problems.
              Thirty-five per cent of its operating costs goes on fuel duty; it
              faces vehicle excise duties; it contributes in terms of operator
              licence fees, VAT, income tax and corporation tax; and, sooner or
              later — if we are to have a viable road haulage industry in
              Northern Ireland — the Chancellor will have to act. The question
              is whether we will have an industry left. Or will it be permitted
              to go to the wall?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have already mentioned the position of
              petrol retailers, who face severe problems in Northern Ireland,
              particularly in border areas. When we talk about border areas we
              must consider the fact that business people in Northern Ireland
              are becoming prepared to travel further and further to get cheaper
              fuel. This is a creeping problem. I know from talking to some
              petrol retailers who are suffering, and who are located many miles
              from the border, that something has got to be done about that
              distortion of trade and competition issue.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Member aware that about three quarters
              of a billion litres of the fuel used here is bought outside the
              Province, with a loss to the economy of about £460 million? The
              high-taxation policy is detrimental to jobs and reduces the amount
              of revenue that is raised in the Province.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think that all Members would agree, and I
              thank the Member for drawing those points to our attention.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also wish to speak on behalf of the
              hard-pressed motorist. It is sometimes unfashionable to point out
              the difficulties that motorists face. The reality is that for many
              people in Northern Ireland — the disabled, the elderly and
              people in rural areas — there is no viable alternative to using
              their private cars. The fact that only 15% of the tax on petrol
              and fuel goes into public transport infrastructure in Northern
              Ireland and across the United Kingdom brings home a point about
              which many motorists and other people who buy fuel feel very
              strongly — namely, that they do not believe they are getting a
              proper return in the shape of money being invested in the public
              transport and transport infrastructure of the Province.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Points have been highlighted about agriculture
              and the rural economy. Our fishing industry is no different,
              having seen a 155% increase in the cost of fuel for the fleet.
              That means that 30% of a vessel’s entire earnings are now taken
              up by fuel costs. There is another issue which we should not
              forget, that of the heating oil and kerosene used by home owners
              and tenants in Northern Ireland. Its price has escalated rapidly,
              on average going up 115% over the last two years, so that at the
              moment 900 litres costs £215. Only 5% of homes in the rest of the
              United Kingdom are centrally heated by oil, whereas here the
              figure is over 50%. Once again, one sees the massive impact in
              Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is to be done? It is essential that the
              Chancellor of the Exchequer act to bring down excise duty — and,
              by extension, VAT — on fuel. He says he needs money for health
              and schools and all the other major projects the Government have.
              We accept that there must be major investment in those areas as
              well as others. However, the reality is that he is reaping a
              windfall. The money he is getting now through excise duty and VAT
              is over and above that which he had already calculated and figured
              into his expenditure plans. He cannot therefore claim that cutting
              this tax will be detrimental to expenditure plans.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure the hon Member is aware that, at the
              time the Chancellor made those provisions, the price of a barrel
              of oil was $22. It is now $35. I think the Member will agree that
              the fact that Britain is also a net producer of oil, receiving
              additional revenue of between £4 billion and £8 billion, totally
              explodes the Chancellor’s figures.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is absolutely right, and it is essential
              that it be pointed out. Not only is this a taxation windfall, but
              there are booming revenues from North Sea oil production. We have
              seen a massive influx into Government coffers from the mobile
              phone licence competition, and it is clear that the Chancellor has
              the room to act. There is a moral imperative for him to do so, and
              I hope now that instead of sympathy and nice words from the
              Government, action will be taken. I fear that if that is not the
              case the disruption we have seen across the United Kingdom will
              have been a picnic compared to what is to come. It is vital that
              the Chancellor and the Prime Minister, Tony&nbsp;Blair, start to
              listen, rather than offer sympathetic, sugar-coated words. They
              must take action to reduce tax on fuel, and they must do it as
              soon as possible.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It goes without saying that all parties in the
              Assembly welcome and support this motion. It has two basic parts,
              the first being to call upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer to
              reduce the burden of fuel duty. The second element is to encourage
              other EU member states to bring their taxes into line with those
              of neighbouring countries. I should like to deal with those two
              issues individually, for they are separate and distinct. We must
              be careful not to confuse one with the other.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The events of the last week have highlighted
              what was already known, but perhaps not realised — the enormous
              effect of higher fuel costs on our economy. By &quot;economy&quot;
              I mean all the strata of society in Northern Ireland — the
              hauliers, the manufacturers, the fishermen, the farmers, the home
              fuel distributors and the road users. We are only now beginning to
              realise just how enormous this tax is. However, it is not a new
              tax; it has been going on for a considerable time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I observed with some amusement the hypocrisy of
              certain previous Government spokespersons who were castigating the
              current Government for their dereliction of duty in imposing
              additional taxes. The year-on-year, tax-on-tax approach of the
              previous Government increased this tax enormously. The irony is
              that it was the Conservative Party, when it was in power, which
              introduced the escalator tax, over and above the excise duty, thus
              adding to the cost of fuel. Indeed, the last budget was the first
              time in years that the escalator tax factor was not applied.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That does not in any way exonerate any
              Government of responsibility for the position we are in today. It
              is extraordinary how communities throughout Europe have
              spontaneously and suddenly realised the position that they have
              been brought to as a result of oil production prices from the OPEC
              countries and the internally imposed problems of the revenues
              which successive Governments in many countries have imposed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland we suffer a double jeopardy
              — excise duty on fuel and a peripherality that adds to transport
              costs. We also suffer from the fact that we have a land border
              with a country that has a much lower rate of fuel tax, and that is
              exacerbated by the exchange rates between the punt and sterling
              and between the euro and sterling — two entirely different
              economic systems.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many statistics have been well presented by the
              joint proposers of the motion. All of us can rehearse these in our
              subsequent contributions, but it is sufficient to emphasise them.
              No matter what industry you look at, you will clearly see the
              effect that fuel prices have had on transport, production costs,
              home fuels, motor cars and everything else that modern society
              depends on.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much has been said about the question of the
              escalator tax. It was a green tax, designed to somehow assist
              environmental protection by taxing the motorist. It is a fraction
              of the excise duty and, like the old road tax which was referred
              to, is not even given over to environmental protection matters. It
              is simply another revenue-producing mechanism that increases the
              general taxation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most dramatic statistic I saw was that over
              the last 10&nbsp;years, fuel duties increased in the Republic of
              Ireland by 6% and in the UK by 242% — an enormous differential.
              We must be careful how we address that issue. It is not just as
              simple as some of the suggestions that have been made. Perhaps
              Mr&nbsp;Beggs overemphasised the differential between the North of
              Ireland and the Republic of Ireland as the main, or a substantial,
              cause of our problem. That is not necessarily correct. By the way,
              I welcome, and cannot help referring to, the fact that he is
              totally opposed to traffic disruption. Long may that continue in
              all its aspects.</p>

              adding to and imposing taxes. As Mr Beggs said, three-quarters —
              actually, 71% — of our fuel expenditure goes to the general
              exchequer. That situation cannot be allowed to continue. It is
              difficult for Northern Ireland, susceptible as it is to the
              additional difficulties of peripherality and proximity to a
              cheaper fuel regime, to take direct action that will not be
              detrimental to our own economy, as well as the greater economy,
              including tourism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not a new situation. Northern Ireland
              has had this problem for a very long time. I first took the issue
              up with the Minister responsible, Mr Adam Ingram, in March 1999.
              He told me that the Government was concerned about the problem and
              taking firm action to address it. Eighteen months later, no action
              whatsoever has been taken, never mind firm action.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The differential causes exceptional
              difficulties for trade in Northern Ireland. The oil industry
              itself has been decimated by these events. Here are some
              statistics on petrol station closures. One company has closed all
              28 of its sites, another has been reduced from 28 sites to nine,
              another is selling three, and others are considering pulling out
              altogether. That is allied to the great difficulties retailers
              have across large areas of Northern Ireland. It is not just a
              border issue any longer. The differential is so great that traffic
              can travel a long distance and still make it profitable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have met Patricia Hewitt, who is the Minister
              responsible, and the previous Ministers, Lord Dubs and Adam
              Ingram. The issue has been raised in the Northern Ireland Affairs
              Select Committee as an urgent matter affecting the economy of
              Northern Ireland. I have taken party delegations to the Chancellor
              of the Exchequer. The tragedy of it all is that nothing has moved
              them, for one very simple reason: in spite of the loss of revenue
              through smuggling, paramilitary and other criminal activities, and
              the additional costs incurred by Customs and Excise in increasing
              their staff from 23 to 35 and appointing specialist officers, it
              is not a significant loss to the Exchequer. The loss of revenue in
              Northern Ireland is not a significant loss, and therefore it does
              not attract their attention.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not an argument that we are going to win.
              As the proposal suggested, we have to harness our arguments with
              those of Welsh Assembly, the Scottish Parliament, and Members at
              Westminster to lobby the Government, on a nationwide basis, to
              reduce fuel duties and road taxes to a reasonable and acceptable
              level.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only through a united, concentrated effort will
              an impact be made on the Chancellor, the Prime Minister and the
              Government — who will ultimately make this decision. This will
              not be a short-term campaign. It will be a very difficult one. I
              hope that it is not a disruptive one, because by disruption we
              inflict wounds on ourselves that we cannot afford. This can be
              done without disruption, and without undue militancy, but it must
              be done on a consistent, cohesive and collective basis. My party
              supports the generality of the motion and we look forward to
              participating with other parties in the Assembly to form a joint
              presentation. I hope that it will be spearheaded by the
              appropriate departmental Ministers in the Assembly on a strong
              public and international basis. Given the experiences of the last
              18 months, this is the only way to bring about change. The only
              effective change that we can make is to have an immediate
              reduction.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been talk of waiting for the autumn
              Budget. That may be possible if the autumn Budget is next month.
              However, if that does not make a substantial, meaningful
              contribution to our problem, then we will have to address it in a
              stronger and more virulent way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The differential between fuel duties in both
              North and South has been exacerbated by the currency exchange.
              During the Finance Bill debate, in representations to the
              Chancellor and his Ministers of State I asked repeatedly for a
              special scheme for Northern Ireland to be implemented. A scheme
              has been implemented along the Dutch and German border, where
              differentials were considerable — though not nearly as
              considerable as the differentials we had. At that time there was a
              great reluctance among the Ministers at Westminster and the
              Ministers in Northern Ireland to alleviate the distress that had
              been caused — mostly in the border areas and affecting the
              smaller retailers, hauliers and transport companies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Dutch implemented a scheme. Part of the
              scheme was ruled out by the European Court, which is fair enough.
              However, part of that scheme is still in operation. There is no
              justification for the British Government not introducing that
              part, which was tolerated and allowed to continue by the European
              Commission, to the border areas of Northern Ireland. That is
              another practical avenue where a remedy can be achieved for the
              additional problem that we have. Even if the taxes are reduced,
              they will not be reduced sufficiently to address the problem of
              the differential between the two countries. We need a reduction in
              general taxation, combined with a scheme to alleviate the contrast
              in the border areas.</p>

              of Ireland, North and South. I encourage it to take on as many of
              our problems as it can and to address them. However, to ask the
              Republic of Ireland Government to increase their taxes would be
              rather silly.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why should we ask other Governments to impose a
              burden on people when we are trying to reduce the same burden for
              ourselves? That is the reality of the situation. You do not make a
              bad situation worse by creating another bad situation for your
              neighbour. Harmonisation on a European scale must come about,
              otherwise this problem will continue, not just between the North
              of Ireland and the Republic but also between many other countries.
              As has been said, difficulties already exist between Holland and
              Germany and several other nations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Returning to the original point — which I
              must emphasise — the real problem is the 71% excise duty imposed
              by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. That is our first target. We
              must not be diverted into long-term projects concerning the
              differentials between North and South. The lack of an exchange
              mechanism is an obvious long-term project to pursue, but that is
              of such import that we know we will have little impact if we ask
              the British Government to enter into the European monetary union.
              In the meantime, our target, which must be focused and consistent,
              must be reduced taxes at Westminster. My party will support the
              motion in all its aspects and in the terms which I have suggested
              to the Assembly. I look forward to a joint exercise with all the
              other parties in this Chamber to further the cause of duty
              reduction.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Doherty:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A LeasCheann Comhairle, I welcome and support
              this motion. There is great concern about the escalating cost of
              fuel and even greater concern about the British exchequer’s
              attitude — an attitude which reflects no consideration of the
              economic effects which partition and two tax regimes have created
              in our country. Indeed, the North of Ireland is only an
              afterthought when the British Government considers finances. I
              believe that both the proposers of this motion also recognise this
              in the second half of their motion, which I read as Unionist-speak
              for an all-Ireland fuel policy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Owing to the underdevelopment of the rail
              network and the consequent over-dependence on roads, the price of
              fuel is crucial in Ireland. Fuel tax, unfortunately, is a reserved
              matter for the British Government, but as the Assembly evolves and
              develops, one option which could be examined is a mileage-based or
              gallon-based fuel rebate system. The administration of this could
              be minimised by allowing rebates to be deducted from VAT or other
              tax liabilities. However, as long as we have two tax systems on
              this island, we will always experience difficulties. The
              uncertainty created by fuel pricing underlines again the Sinn
              Féin argument that what we need is an all-Ireland economy. Only
              then will the days of being held to ransom at the petrol pumps by
              the British exchequer be over.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To address these problems in the long term, the
              British Minister and his counterpart in Dublin should explore ways
              and means of harmonising tax and duty rates. While there has
              understandably been a focus on fuel prices at petrol pumps, we
              also need to recognise — and this point was brought up earlier
              — that high tax and duty rates also adversely affect the price
              of home heating oil, and perhaps that pain is felt more intensely
              than that felt by motorists and road hauliers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We support and welcome this motion, and we
              would like to see a speedy resolution of the problem.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I applaud the initiative of Mr Beggs and
              Mr&nbsp;Dodds in bringing this very serious issue to the Floor of
              the House, where the elected representatives in
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland can add their voice to those demanding
              change. I also take the opportunity to publicly applaud the mature
              attitude that has been adopted by the Road Haulage Association,
              the Petrol Retailers Association, the Federation of Small
              Businesses, the Confederation of British Industry and the Ulster
              Farmers’ Union, which have all been involved in the fuel crisis
              group, the many other trade and voluntary organisations throughout
              Northern Ireland and the great Northern Ireland public.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In spite of the fact that we in Northern
              Ireland suffer more because of escalating fuel prices than those
              in the South of Ireland, Scotland, Wales or England, there have
              not been any organised road blockades in Northern Ireland. That
              has got to be applauded. Northern Ireland has not been brought to
              a standstill.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our people, particularly the various
              organisations to which I have referred, have used the democratic
              process in a determined fashion and with great dignity in an
              effort to get their message across. For that reason above all, we,
              as their elected representatives, must support them and
              demonstrate that somebody is listening to their plight. We must
              ensure that their message is transmitted with the maximum
              democratic clout to the Prime Minister, the Chancellor, the
              Treasury and all those who hold and control the purse strings.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In some respects it could be said that the
              democratic process itself is on trial over this issue. If it is
              not seen to deliver, to listen and to deal with such causes as are
              currently facing it, then there are serious questions to be
              answered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Prime Minister and the Chancellor are on
              record as saying that they cannot and will not give in to
              blackmail, threats or blockades. As a democrat, I have sympathy
              with that view, but equally I firmly believe that the Government
              have a duty to listen to the people and to respond positively to a
              just cause that has the backing of the overwhelming majority of
              the people. This is such a cause. I challenge the Prime Minister
              to put our money where his mouth is and to recognise in a tangible
              fashion the mature attitude adopted by the people in Northern
              Ireland in the current crisis.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We live, as has already been said, in a
              peripheral society. Our fuel costs are higher than elsewhere in
              the United Kingdom. We share a land border with another EU country
              where fuel tax is considerably less; thus we suffer from unfair
              competition. Prime Minister, if you will not give in to blackmail,
              you will surely reward the long-suffering people of Northern
              Ireland whose voice and reason have been their only weapons. Cut
              our fuel taxes now, or give us in Northern Ireland some form of
              rebate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also urge the First Minister, the Deputy
              First Minister and the other Ministers to take this message to
              Downing Street as soon as possible. The people do not want just
              sympathy; they want action from their democratically elected
              leaders.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must also be made clear that the oil
              companies are not to blame for the current crisis. Nor do I accept
              the line that is currently being peddled that a reduction in fuel
              taxes would inevitably have an adverse effect upon the Health
              Service, education, and so on.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Britain is unique among the other European
              countries in that it is a net exporter of oil. I have recently
              seen figures to suggest that in the first half of this year alone
              there was a surplus of £2·5&nbsp;billion on the oil account.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every time the price of crude oil rises there
              is a revenue bonus for the Chancellor. If he were a member of a
              caring Government he would have given some of this windfall back
              to the people and reduced the price of fuel. Why has this windfall
              been buried in a cloud of half-truths and presumably tucked away
              in some election war chest?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have the highest petrol and diesel costs in
              Europe, if not the world, because we suffer from obscene taxation
              on fuel. As Mr Dodds pointed out, it is actually worse than that.
              We suffer from obscene double taxation on fuel. We are taxed on
              the tax that the Government levy on fuel. I was amazed to learn
              that the price of petrol in the United Kingdom is lower than in
              the USA. It is less than 18p per litre in the United Kingdom
              compared to over 19p in the USA, yet we pay almost £4 per gallon,
              whereas the price is less than £1 in the United States.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The difference is not in the profits of the oil
              companies or petrol retailers — they get about 1p per litre. The
              difference is in the tax taken by the Government — 70p to 75p.
              At least Dick Turpin had the decency to wear a mask. Gordon Brown
              and Tony Blair have the barefaced audacity to blame everybody but
              themselves, and to date they have even refused to listen to those
              who have pointed out the error of their ways.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I must be fair. The attempts by
              William Hague and his political cronies to capitalise on Labour’s
              difficulties is political opportunism at its worst. We all
              remember that it was the Tory Chancellor, Norman Lamont, who
              introduced the fuel duty escalator in 1993. This highway robbery
              was continued by Kenneth Clarke, resulting in fuel duty increasing
              by 5% more than inflation during the years 1993 to 1996. It was
              dressed up as a green tax, but I would prefer to call it a con
              tax.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Labour Party, not to be outdone in
              exorbitant taxation, increased the escalator to 6% when it came to
              power, and the result was fuel duty going up by 10% in 1997, 10%
              in 1998 and another 10% in March 1999. While the Labour Government
              have dropped the fuel escalator, the damage has been done. I
              appeal for this highway robbery to stop. It is totally
              counter-productive, particularly in Northern Ireland, where it is
              killing businesses. It is killing the road haulage industry, and
              it is making all of us suffer unduly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As duty is much less in the South of Ireland,
              there is a daily flow of vehicles travelling across the border to
              fill up with fuel, and, as has been mentioned, smuggling is rife.
              I understand that smugglers can gross as much as £35,000 per week
              through their illegal practices. How else can we explain that
              between 1994 and 1999 there was an increase of 124,694 in the
              number of vehicles registered in Northern Ireland, yet during the
              same period the amount of fuel delivered to Northern Ireland fell
              by 41·6%? The Treasury is losing money hand over fist through its
              blindness.</p>

              motorists and the fuel industry. Rather than seeking powers to
              further increase prices, we should be looking for a reduction in
              prices.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The events of the past week have been the most
              momentous in the life of the Labour Administration. The
              characteristic response of the Prime Minister has been to
              misrepresent the nature of the protests and blame high fuel prices
              on OPEC and the oil companies. Government by spin and mendacity
              may have reached the end of the road. The electorate simply does
              not believe the Prime Minister. The Sunday Times/NOP poll of 17
              September showed that 71% of the electorate blames the Government
              for high fuel prices and 77% does not accept the Government’s
              claim that there is no scope for cutting tax on fuel.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The electorate is correct on both counts.
              First, there is scope for a reduction in fuel tax. The Institute
              of Directors and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) have
              calculated that the Chancellor has scope to cut duty and VAT on
              unleaded petrol by up to 6p per litre because of the tax windfall
              from higher North Sea oil prices. That windfall is worth about £8
              billion to the Treasury. Fuel taxes must be cut immediately. That
              would have the added advantage of constraining the Government in
              their waste of millions of pounds on stupid projects, such as
              Mr&nbsp;Mandelson’s brainchild, the Millennium Dome. Secondly,
              the Government have been literally ripping off the vast majority
              of people in the United Kingdom for whom the purchase of fuel is
              an entirely unavoidable necessity. At least two thirds of the rise
              in the price of petrol since May 1997 has been due to higher tax.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The mechanism employed by the Chancellor has
              been a form of stealth taxation based on a fuel duty escalator
              introduced by Norman Lamont in March 1993. The ostensible reason
              for this tax was to contribute to the prevention of ozone
              depletion, but the real reason had nothing to do with the
              environment. The real reason for the introduction of the fuel duty
              escalator was to reduce a £46 billion budget deficit that had
              resulted from the boom-and-bust policies of Nigel Lawson in the
              late 1980s. Chancellor Brown has used this stealth tax to its very
              limit. The CBI calculates that only 15% of revenue raised through
              fuel taxes is reinvested in transport infrastructure and public
              transport.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The result of Labour policy is that while the
              United Kingdom is a net exporter of oil, it pays higher fuel
              prices than any other western European country. The result is a
              massive distortion of competitiveness affecting major sectors of
              United Kingdom industry. The situation is exacerbated in Northern
              Ireland due to the weakness of the euro against sterling. Fuel
              costs for farmers and fishermen in Northern Ireland have increased
              by 110% in the past 12 months. Derv prices are 83% higher in
              Northern Ireland than in the Republic.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The combined result of tax differentials and
              exchange rate movements has put severe pressure on local business
              and caused a massive growth in criminality on the part of
              terrorist organisations left intact by the Belfast Agreement. CBI
              Northern Ireland calculates that individual fuel smugglers can
              gross up to £35,000 per week, thus undermining honest business.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">High underlying fuel prices will continue. The
              western economies are currently facing historic oil shortages. At
              the same time, many OPEC members have little scope to pump out
              extra oil as they are already operating close to capacity. The
              crisis of unacceptably high fuel prices will not be resolved in
              the long term by a short-term manipulation of tax rates. The
              crisis is due to something deeper than an entirely legitimate
              concern about oil prices.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The crisis reflects a United Kingdom economy
              — indeed, an EU economy — that has reached the limit of
              taxable capacity. This is shown by the fact that 78% of the UK
              electorate supports the protests and blockages and 85% demands a
              cut in fuel taxation. This is very relevant to the dominant
              tax-raising mentality — which we have just heard about — in
              the Assembly. This mentality is out of touch with the requirement
              of economic success in a capitalist, competitive global economy.
              The current fuel tax crisis is indicative of the imperative to
              move towards a low-tax economy in the United Kingdom by a radical
              rolling-back of the frontiers of the state in the areas of social
              welfare, education and health and to substitute for state
              provision the development of private market-orientated provision
              in these areas. State provision in these areas is marked by
              inefficiencies that squander literally uncountable billions of
              taxpayers’ money.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This political crisis provides politicians and
              business leaders in Northern Ireland with the opportunity to put
              themselves in the vanguard of a new progressive thinking aimed at
              the creation in the United Kingdom of a minimalist state which is
              required to lay the basis of a low tax economy. That is what is
              required for economic prosperity in the context of permanent
              global capitalism. The Government could then concentrate on its
              primary function of effectively protecting the lives and property
              of law-abiding citizens. The NIUP supports the motion and demands
              an immediate cut in fuel taxation before further irreparable
              damage is done to major sectors of business in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. There are a number of
              issues in this debate. Foremost must be the rise in fuel costs
              attributable to the rise in the price of crude oil, and hence the
              rise imposed at the pumps by the oil companies. Second is the tax
              take of the Government through fuel duties and VAT. Thirdly, there
              is a disparity in fuel prices throughout Europe and the civilised
              world.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, and most importantly, we must consider
              the impact of the exorbitant price of fuel on our economy and on
              the public, given the poor public transport links available in the
              Province. The oil companies are making disproportionate profits at
              the expense of the travelling public and British industry. Over
              the past week the oil companies have tried to raise prices by 2p
              per litre, only to back down due to public, and perhaps
              Government, pressure. Industry sources say that the rise was not
              wholly needed to cover crude oil prices but was an exercise in
              profiteering on the companies’ part. In fact, 1p would have
              covered the rise in the price of crude oil.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, we have the Government’s double
              whammy in taking both duty and VAT on the same product. It is well
              known that 75% of the price of a litre of fuel is made up of tax.
              That is totally unacceptable and must be addressed immediately.
              The Government is wrong to say that all this tax is needed for
              public services. It is a fact that for every $1 rise in oil
              prices, the Government gain £330&nbsp;million per year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recent rises since the Government’s
              comprehensive spending review in July totalled $11 a barrel, so
              the Chancellor would bring in an extra £3·7 billion in tax
              revenue. Translating this into petrol duty would cut 7·5p a litre
              off the cost of fuel. I call on Gordon Brown to make these
              legitimate cuts immediately to allow our hard-pressed industrial
              base and the motoring public some breathing space.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has also been suggested that we should have
              a VAT-lowering mechanism to be triggered when world oil prices
              rise above a certain level. I would welcome such a measure, as
              would the public, but I believe it should be set up so that the
              red tape would not outweigh the benefits, and that the cost would
              not be passed on to the public.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must consider the disparity in fuel prices
              between here and the rest of Europe, our main trading partners.
              These disparities are belittled by the Government, and the public
              is fed untruths to keep the blame away from the national
              Government’s door. I will list four lies that were highlighted
              in the press over the last week.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, &quot;Motorists are no worse off than
              their European counterparts as, in Europe, motorists must pay
              tolls, even though taxes are much less in Europe.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact is we pay higher fuel duties than
              anywhere in Europe. We pay more to buy our cars. Motor tax is
              greater here than almost anywhere in Europe and, although some
              Europeans have road tolls, the income from them is spent almost
              wholly on transport issues.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Member aware that throughout France,
              which spends 80% of its tax revenue from motor fuel on roads, one
              can travel on the <i>route nationale,</i> which is better than
              most of our motorways, and whether one travels on a toll road is
              entirely optional?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was not aware of that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second point I would like to highlight,
              which was a mistruth on the part of the Government, is &quot;Cuts
              in fuel tax will hit spending on health and education.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since spending plans were revised in July,
              increased Government income would allow cuts in fuel duty of 8p a
              litre, with no resultant cuts in public services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A third misleading statement was &quot;Tax
              cannot be changed except during the March Budget&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact is that under the 1979 Excise Duties
              (Surcharges or Rebates) Act the Chancellor can raise and lower
              fuel duties by up to 10% at any time, without requiring
              legislation. This would allow petrol prices to be cut by 20p a
              gallon.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fourth misleading point is &quot;High fuel
              tax protects the environment by cutting pollution.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is little evidence to support the
              assertion that raising fuel taxes cuts pollution. Even though the
              fuel tax has risen exorbitantly since 1993, the miles driven has
              also risen — by 12%. If the environment is so important to the
              Government, would it not make more sense for them to invest in
              clean technology and energy-efficient measures?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My final point, which is more important and
              nearer to home, is that more than any other part of the United
              Kingdom, Northern Ireland depends on oil for its energy. We have
              an agriculture industry, already crippled by bad prices, finding
              its fuel costs increased drastically throughout the last year.
              This adds to the costs of both farmers and agriculture contractors
              and, indirectly, as hauliers are affected, we find that input
              costs also rise. Our haulage businesses suffer, as they cannot
              pass on price rises to their customers and risk being replaced by
              hauliers from the South. Our rural areas depend on oil to carry
              out almost any function throughout the day, especially in the
              farming community. We are on the periphery of Europe, and, apart
              from oil, there is no type of fuel we can use.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much of the Province also depends on oil for
              home heating. Therefore any price rise impacts on the most needy
              in society — namely, the young, the unemployed and the elderly.
              We also have a land border with another EU state. That gives rise
              to smuggling on a grand scale, creating great losses to our public
              funds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In supporting this motion, I call on the
              Chancellor to cut fuel duties immediately and to cut or abolish
              VAT above a specified world oil price threshold. I also call on
              the Chancellor to cut the remaining VAT on home heating oil as
              this is not a luxury but a necessity. I support the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this stage of the debate it might be said
              that the field has not just been played upon but has been
              ploughed. Therefore I will endeavour to confine my remarks to some
              salient, and perhaps greener, parts of the pitch. There is no
              doubt that the situation threatening our agricultural and haulage
              base with extinction is caused by two main considerations: first,
              the absolutely punitive rates of excise duty and VAT on motor
              fuel; and secondly, but directly related to the first
              consideration, the softly, softly policy of the Government in
              relation to the commercial activities of paramilitaries.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of these figures lead to interesting
              conclusions. The number of vehicles in Northern Ireland has risen
              by 21% since 1995. There have been 125,000 additional vehicles
              registered in Northern Ireland in that period. The amount of
              legally imported fuel has dropped by over 50%, according to the
              figures of the Petrol Retailers Association. Even the Government
              say that it has dropped by 41%. If you have an increase in the
              number of users of motor fuel, and you have a fantastic reduction
              in the amount of fuel that is legally imported, then the only
              conclusion must be that a vast quantity of fuel is being illegally
              imported into Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, that is not the only reason. An
              increasing and significant number of owners of vehicles registered
              in Northern Ireland are going into the Republic to top up their
              tanks.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not just at the moment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For some hauliers, proximity to the border
              makes it viable for them to go into the Republic. They are filling
              up their vehicles in the Republic as much as they can. Many major
              haulage contractors have also registered their vehicles in the
              Republic because the vehicle licensing excise duty fee there is
              about a third of what they pay in Northern Ireland. The effect of
              Northern Ireland-registered vehicles filling up in the Republic is
              to pour millions into the coffers of its Treasury.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many informed sources believe that up to 30% of
              all motor fuel used in Northern Ireland is unlawfully imported
              from the Republic. It is imported through the border areas of
              south&nbsp;Armagh and, to a degree, Fermanagh. It is imported
              through areas controlled by paramilitary groups which, if not
              actually running these unlawful operations, are undoubtedly
              extracting licensing fees. Huge amounts of money are providing a
              financial base for terrorism that will threaten our entire
              society, North and South. The political representatives of some of
              those people are in this Assembly. They have the approach of
              whited sepulchres, and they make speeches in the Chamber attacking
              the British Treasury.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that the Chancellor is good
              measure for a significant degree of criticism, as many Members
              have already indicated. However, Mr McGrady, for the SDLP, was
              strangely silent on his partners in the pan-Nationalist front, who
              are undoubtedly delighted that the British Treasury is rightly
              getting stick. They, and the groups that they represent, are
              contributing in no small part to the difficulties experienced by
              honest and decent lawful traders in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was mentioned that some 60 petrol retailers
              have gone out of business in the last year. I have information
              about a petrol retailer who puts up a notice on his station
              stating &quot;The only fuel here is legally obtained&quot;. He
              does this in a psychological endeavour to compete with a petrol
              station some one hundred yards away that is grossly undercutting
              him by selling fuel at a price at which the lawful trader cannot
              even purchase it, let alone sell it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my constituency I have had other people with
              small businesses — running newspaper and tobacconist shops —
              who buy their cigarette and tobacco stock from a lawful source and
              who cannot compete with those around them who are flogging
              contraband goods brought in by paramilitaries. I have to say that
              the paramilitaries concerned are not of the green variety, though
              my oft-stated view in this Assembly is that I have absolutely
              nothing but loathing for paramilitaries, whether they be orange,
              green or polka-dotted. However, I loathe the hypocrisy of those,
              such as the representatives of Sinn Fein and, to a lesser degree,
              Mr McGrady, who have attempted to soft-pedal the fact that the
              corruption that is spreading from paramilitary activity is
              beginning to invade every stratum of society.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of those who can afford to drive
              expensive, powerful cars and provide a four-wheel-drive vehicle
              for the missis to pick up the kiddies, and even those who are
              driving a business car or a company vehicle where they can
              write-off the increased duties to their tax and reclaim the VAT,
              are prepared to admit that for them the increases in petrol fuel
              are relatively unimportant. However, for the haulier, the farmer,
              the fisherman, the small businessman, the manual worker who needs
              his vehicle to get to work, the retired resident in a rural area
              on a fixed income, a car and such transport is not a luxury. It is
              a fundamental and basic necessity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Society is being corrupted because, for the
              sake of maintaining what passes for peace in the form of a
              terrorist-controlled ceasefire, there has been a marked reluctance
              by this Government to provide a strategy for the Customs and
              Excise to deal with a problem that will lead to grave
              difficulties, not just for those on the margin, but, ultimately,
              for some of the larger players.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A major company operating in the fuel business
              — a major employer with assets of over £100 million — has
              already indicated that such have been the cuts in its profit
              margins due to smuggling that withdrawal from the Province is
              increasingly becoming a viable consideration.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chancellor must act, and he must act soon.
              With everyone in the Assembly, and most law-abiding citizens, I
              endorse the view that at present we should be attempting to avoid
              blockades that would damage the foundations and base of our
              commercial and other businesses.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sympathise with those industrialists and
              bigger players who feel that the blockade might do irreparable
              damage, but I issue this warning. A point will come when those who
              are against the wall will look after their interests and those of
              their families. It will be all very well for those at a higher
              level to say there must be no blockade. Some people will have no
              alternative. They are the small petrol retailers, who are going
              out of business, and the farmers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farmers have to pay for fertiliser, feed and
              stock to be hauled onto the farm and produce to be hauled out.
              They are faced with escalating transport charges and see profits
              from pork, beef or lamb production going down the Swanee.</p>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is vitally important that we persuade the
              Chancellor to listen, for he has not listened. He has told us lies
              and he has fabricated untruths. He has designated what were
              largely peaceful blockades as peaceful — so peaceful that many
              Chief Constables could not arrest people because they were not
              committing any offence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We saw macho-man Blair come on and say he was
              going to do X, Y and Z, and that everything would be rolling in
              24&nbsp;hours. In today’s ‘Daily Telegraph’, Siôn Simon —
              a Labour apologist — described these people as terrorists. Mr
              Blair was going to do the most dreadful things to them. Yet we are
              faced with his sickening, absurd surrender to paramilitarism and
              terrorism that is destroying the whole base of society, not just
              on the Shankill but now in North Down. All strata of society must
              get together. If we do not look after the small petrol retailer,
              and the farmers who are mortgaged up to the hilt and who have
              never drawn a penny of public welfare in generations, it will only
              be a matter of time before this poison spreads to higher levels in
              society.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should remember these words of John Donne:</p>

              substantial period, I have to ask that Members do not go beyond
              their 10 minutes. If the Members listed take 10 minutes each I
              will have to bring speeches to a close. This is an attempt to make
              sure that all Members get a chance to express themselves.</p>

              </i><b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for the opportunity to
              participate in this important debate. I will restrict myself to
              the time you have mentioned, Mr Speaker. I am grateful to my
              Colleagues Mr Beggs and Mr&nbsp;Dodds. This is an extremely timely
              and important debate in the context of events outside this House,
              in other parts of the United Kingdom and in the Irish Republic.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also conscious that this is not a new
              crisis emerging only over recent days. It has existed for many
              months — since 1997 at least. It has already caused job losses
              and the closure of many small businesses, road haulage firms and
              petrol retailers and, in my constituency of Newry and Armagh all
              those businesses have been affected by the crisis.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also aware that the Assembly has no
              responsibility in this matter. It is a reserved matter.
              Nevertheless, I hope the Secretary of State will take the
              opportunity to listen to the views of this Assembly albeit via
              Hansard. It is crucial that the views of this House are reflected
              in the strongest possible terms to the Prime Minister, the
              Chancellor of the Exchequer and other members of the Cabinet.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to concentrate on the plight of the
              petrol retailers, many of whom have made representations to me. It
              is very clear that successive Chancellors, irrespective of party,
              have used fuel excise duty as a way of generating Government money
              to put various schemes and policies in place.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The creation of the fuel escalator combined
              with the exchange rate difference, especially in relation to the
              Irish Republic, has created a lethal cocktail which many local
              operators have been unable to withstand. Approximately 90
              legitimate retailers have gone out of business over recent months.
              Government statistics confirm that sales of legitimate fuel have
              effectively been halved since 1994. However, there has been a 20%
              increase in the number of vehicles on the roads in Northern
              Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It remains inexplicable how any Chancellor
              representing any Government can afford to lose in excess of £300
              million in revenue. That is the conservative estimate available at
              this time. One wonders what this Assembly could achieve with that
              amount of money in spending priorities. Consequently, many
              long-standing legitimate petrol retailers have gone out of
              business. They have gone out of business only to be replaced by
              spivs and highly questionable opportunists, many of whom have
              links to the paramilitaries.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take this opportunity to register my
              concerns, and those of many in the fuel industry, about the
              flagrant and open abuse of the sale and illegal transportation of
              fuel in border areas, organised and controlled by paramilitaries
              that are mostly, but not exclusively, Republican. Government
              failure to adequately resource a proper Customs and Excise
              response to this problem makes me extremely suspicious that there
              may be political reasons for not dealing with this issue properly.
              I sincerely hope that is not the case. As I travel the roads of
              south Armagh I see tankers and lorries travelling on minor roads,
              some of them on approved roads, bringing their cargo. The illegal
              operation is quite alarming and must be addressed urgently.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Urgent action is required if this important
              sector of our economy is to be rescued. The cost to the local
              economy and the environment has already been too high. At last,
              public opinion on this matter has been mobilised by the clever
              tactics of the various sectors to highlight and expose the greedy
              Treasury.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I pay tribute to those in the rest of the
              United Kingdom, and in Northern Ireland, who have organised and
              mobilised people on this issue. They have caught the spin doctors
              on the hop and the Government have been shaken to their very
              foundations. The Prime Minister has now been given an opportunity
              to address the situation. The petrol retailers and the people of
              Northern Ireland demand that he and his Government take urgent
              steps to reduce excise duties and deal with the widespread problem
              of fuel smuggling in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential that the Assembly present a
              united front on this very important issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is with regret that I detect a further split
              in the United Kingdom Unionist Party, with Bob&nbsp;McCartney, the
              intellectual, now being voted out of the House.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not want to add to the hothouse gases; we
              want to present concrete proposals that will assist the haulage
              and farming industries and other elements of society that are
              suffering because of the high cost of fuel.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney’s attack on my Colleague Eddie
              McGrady was disgraceful. For many years he has stood up and spoken
              out against all forms of violence. He would in no way condone the
              continuing activities of any paramilitary group. I am sorry that
              Mr McCartney has not remained to hear my response.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reiterate Mr McGrady’s very sensible
              suggestion that at least part of the answer to this problem can be
              found in the European Union. Through our involvement in the
              Assembly, we are constantly reminded that we cannot infringe
              European laws. This problem has a European dimension. As Mr
              McGrady has already pointed out, there are special arrangements in
              other parts of the European Union to take account of tax
              differentials which cause trading problems. I suggest that we take
              our case to Europe. Let us assume that our British friends will
              not stand in our way by saying that this is an internal, domestic
              problem. This is a serious crisis that is impacting on the lives
              of thousands of European citizens. The European Union has not only
              a right but a responsibility to be part of the solution to a
              problem that is caused directly by political land boundaries
              between member states.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The oil crisis did not start last week or last
              month. It has been developing since the 1970s because successive
              British Governments found it too easy to put tax on fuel as a
              convenient means of raising revenue. The difficulty with this
              particular fiscal policy is that it results in the highest rate of
              taxation on fuel in the developed world. This policy has already
              been described as a rip-off, and I agree with that. The term
              &quot;Rip-off Britain&quot; is commonly being applied to an
              economy where it is not just the cost of fuel that is crippling
              the lives of ordinary, decent people. There is a rip-off on many
              consumer goods as a direct result of unfair taxes. An internal
              report prepared for the Treasury shows that furniture and carpets
              are, on average, 56% more expensive than in other European
              countries. Sporting goods cost 31% more, while cars and motorbikes
              set the consumer back an extra 29%. Electrical goods are, on
              average, 22% more expensive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s debate is focused on fuel and tax
              and, therefore, on road hauliers in particular. That other
              industries are also facing serious problems because of the
              differential between the cost of goods here and in other European
              countries cannot be ignored.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that some Members made reference
              to the farming industry. We all know that that economy has been
              decimated by a number of factors including a poor market, but now
              it is being crucified by the escalating price of oil. Farmers are
              a critical part of the rural community, and Ministers in the
              Assembly have an important role to play in highlighting the
              impossible position that they find themselves in.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The car industry is facing serious difficulties
              due to the price differential with imports not only from the
              Republic but also from mainland Europe. Tax is part of the
              problem, but there are other issues which the Government have
              failed to act upon. We are a part of a rip-off economy which needs
              to be resolved, but the Government are doing nothing about it.
              Fuel, as we have been told, is now twice as expensive as in the
              Republic and four times more expensive than in the United States
              of America. The high cost of fuel adds to the cost of all goods
              and services, and the people who suffer most are those on low
              incomes. While the Government might claim that taxation is needed
              to fund Government services, the people who are penalised most are
              those whom the Government would claim they are supporting, namely
              those in greatest need — and, again, I emphasise the farming and
              rural industries.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question remains unanswered as to where
              taxation will come from to fund the Health Service and so on when
              oil runs out in 2030, or at best in 40 years’ time. How much of
              the present tax is spent on developing alternative forms of
              energy? I suspect very little. The environmental issue is often
              used to justify the high cost of fuel but this policy, as we have
              been told many times today, has failed miserably. Those who can
              afford it will go on paying higher prices for fuel, and the people
              who are again penalised are those at the margins of society who
              either cannot afford private transport or have to pay high costs
              for public transport.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our public transport has suffered from
              underinvestment and does not meet the needs of the travelling
              public. In the North the problems are compounded because of the
              land border, and there is no easy solution other than to pay an
              oil rebate, as has already been mentioned. That, however, will not
              stop the huge number of private cars that fill up on the other
              side of the border on a daily basis, and it most certainly will
              offer no comfort to the filling stations in the North which are
              still open and struggling to survive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has to be an end to the see-saw of
              differentials in duty that has occurred over the years, sometimes
              in favour of the North and sometimes in favour of the South. The
              only way to do that is to harmonise taxes on both sides of the
              border. To do otherwise is to create a paradise for smugglers who,
              by the way, do not have to be terrorists plotting to overthrow the
              Government.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Absolutely. Indeed, Mr&nbsp;Kennedy has
              pre-empted something I will say later.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much of the diesel on offer is not smuggled but
              is &quot;manufactured&quot; in the North using mixtures which I
              should perhaps not advertise. In other cases it is laundered with
              the aid of chemicals. Either way it eventually leads to expensive
              repairs for the unsuspecting motorists who buy it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now I come to Mr Kennedy’s well-made point.
              The only long-term solution is for taxes to be harmonised
              throughout Europe, but, in the short term, if Britain has any
              interest in aiding the economic recovery of the North, then its
              Government should act as a Government should and address the
              issues while we still have an economic infrastructure. This
              Assembly in its fledgling days deserves the full support of the
              British Government to deliver, and, at present, they are not
              giving that support. Tax on oil is one issue, but we must remember
              that it is only part of the solution. The cost of road tax is also
              a serious issue. It is often the difference between viability and
              bankruptcy.</p>

              useful function and is not simply a rubber stamp for implementing
              British policy, irrespective of the consequences. A series of
              suggestions has been made before the House. Let us include the
              European dimension, for it is here, I believe, that we will find
              not only a sympathetic ear, but a possible complete, or at least,
              partial solution to a very serious problem.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion draws attention to three issues —
              taxation, competition, and smuggling. They have all been well
              covered already.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall deal first with taxation. We are not
              discussing a fuel crisis today, but a tax crisis. It was the
              extravagant vehicle excise duty which drove hauliers to
              re-register more than 3,500 lorries in the Irish Republic. It is
              the excessive taxation on fuel which encourages thousands of
              motorists to buy it across the border. Its impact is seen right
              across my constituency where, as has been pointed out already,
              scores of filling stations have closed because taxation has made
              it uneconomic to sell their fuel legally.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point has already been made about the
              closure of filling stations, but it is exacerbated by the fact
              that for many of my constituents and, I am sure, for the Member’s,
              their nearest petrol station is now across the border since so
              many have closed along it.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I entirely agree with the Member. Indeed,
              motorists from my own town of Tandragee, which is 20 miles from
              the border, cross it to buy their fuel.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cost of fuel is well known, and the
              question has been covered very well today. When petrol arrives at
              the filling station, it costs a mere 16p a litre. When the
              customer buys that petrol, the cost has risen dramatically to 80p
              or more a litre. The 60p increase goes directly to the Chancellor
              of the Exchequer. Some 72% of the cost of fuel is accounted for by
              pure taxation. In other words, even if the petrol companies gave
              petrol away for free, it would still cost us at least 60p a litre,
              a situation which is neither just nor fair. The basic cost of fuel
              is the same in the United Kingdom as anywhere else. Excessive
              taxation makes the difference. The United Kingdom has the highest
              tax rate in the whole of Europe. The Republic of Ireland,
              Luxembourg, Spain, Greece and Portugal all charge a mere 55p at
              the pump. The price doubles because of tax. In France, Belgium,
              Germany and Italy, the price trebles after tax. Out on its own is
              the United Kingdom, where the price quadruples after tax. While
              the rest of Europe can buy fuel from 55p to 70p a litre, we must
              pay at least 80p to 85p a litre at the pump.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My second point concerns competition. Excessive
              taxation has had a negative impact on competition. It has allowed
              our competitors to begin with every advantage. The French haulier,
              for example, begins with a 17% advantage. When the Labour
              Government came to power in May 1997, the difference in fuel costs
              was 4p a litre. Today, that figure has soared to well over 20p.
              This hinders fair competition, and a civil Government is to blame.
              Instead of helping firms, it is driving them out of business in
              Northern Ireland. The excise rate in the Republic is about
              £1,200, while we in Northern Ireland pay about three times that
              figure — hardly a vote of encouragement for our hauliers or
              farmers. We must look at the tax on heavy goods vehicles. In the
              United Kingdom, it is £3,800, in the Irish Republic £1,200 and
              in Holland £750.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last issue I wish to raise, which has been
              covered very well today, is that of smuggling. Recently four
              laundering plants have been closed down, but when one considers
              that each of those was capable of laundering 750,000 litres a
              year, one realises that the sums involved are vast. Who is losing
              out? Legal petrol stations are — and to such an extent that many
              are closing. The Exchequer is losing at least £40,000 per week.
              One customs officer recently stated that this has become a
              large-scale business. Reference was also made to organised
              criminal gangs which are exploiting the current situation.
              Smuggling has penalised law-abiding people and rewarded the
              racketeers. We are dealing with a problem that has reached
              epidemic proportions. The Northern Ireland Select Committee’s
              report claimed that the Exchequer is losing out on at least £100
              million per year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my constituency, and Mr Kennedy has already
              covered this, you can drive around the roads in south Armagh and
              see these lorries coming across the border. The police, the
              security forces and Customs and Excise have been working
              rigorously to track down these racketeers. It is difficult, but we
              do need more effort to try to track down these racketeers. They
              are mainly Republicans, especially in the area of south Armagh.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a clear focus to secure a reduction in
              fuel prices. If that is not done in Northern Ireland high fuel
              costs will equate to high haulage costs, resulting in high prices
              for consumer goods.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support this motion and trust that action
              will be taken.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Cheann Comhairle, I also support the motion
              and agree with most of what has been said today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to welcome the farmers and
              hauliers who have come to the Assembly to highlight their
              situation. They are at the coalface, and they incur the costs
              directly on their income every day in a big way. I welcome their
              having this opportunity to make their protest heard.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is about taxation more so than fuel. I
              speak mostly about rural areas. Rural dwellers do not have a
              choice in getting from one place to another, unlike city dwellers.
              They have some form of public transport — we have no public
              transport west of the Bann. Therefore people do not have a choice
              — they have to have their own transport. This affects the local
              economy with regard to inward investment. Investors look at those
              areas as being on the periphery and far away from ports. They
              consider that a detriment and decide that they are better off
              basing their industries elsewhere, disadvantaging people who live
              in the west in the matter of equality of job opportunities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agriculture industry, which has had massive
              hikes in its fuel prices — they have more than doubled in the
              last year — is feeling the pinch very severely. It is quite
              noticeable at farm level. People are trying to pay bills from hire
              companies and contractors. These have to be dealt with every year,
              whether they can afford it or not. There is great anger in the
              rural communities. The elderly are facing heating-fuel bills of
              double the price this winter but have been given a measly 75p
              increase on their pensions by Tony Blair, payable next April. This
              shows a lack of commitment to all rural areas by the British
              Government in terms of their wish to see those areas survive
              economically.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How much of the road tax that the hauliers pay
              goes back into roads? The Department of the Environment has a
              budget of £150,000 per year to repair the roads in Fermanagh. A
              company such as the Sean&nbsp;Quinn Group probably pays several
              times that amount in tax on its lorries. Of course, that is
              questionable now that so many have registered their lorries in the
              South, but the money is being paid and has been paid. They are not
              getting equal road quality for their vehicles and the amount of
              money that they are paying. That goes for motor car owners as
              well. There is a massive inequality. People have paid vast sums of
              money over the years and had nothing in return.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with some of the environmental reasons
              for spending money on the environment and reducing emissions.
              However, speeding vehicles use a lot more fuel. Vehicles use one
              third more fuel above 60 mph. Most of the heavy vehicles these
              days are doing 70 mph-plus. There is something that people could
              do themselves to help, without incurring a cost.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Waste management is another problem which
              councils have to face in a bigger way than they have done so far.
              They are only touching the tip of the iceberg in their commitment
              to proper waste management that would make major savings in fuel.
              The free market is another thing that is lauded around the world,
              but it has a great cost in terms of waste and wasteful use of
              fuel. We are allowed to trade our goods from Brazil to Fermanagh.
              Beef is produced in Brazil and carted at great cost across the
              seas and across the roads to our shop shelves. The amount of fuel
              that is used to bring it here is a great cost. Is it really
              cheaper? Add up all the costs that are never counted when one
              compares the price here to the price somewhere else.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For every vehicle that goes down the road with
              goods in it, there is another one full of packaging and nothing
              else. That is another cost of the free market. I do not know what
              to do about it. Running two vehicles to deliver the same goods and
              bring them back again so that people can have massive choice is
              very costly in terms of global fuel costs. That is something
              people will have to look at in years to come.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. There is to ing and fro
              ing about whether we should be speaking on an all-Ireland basis,
              or aiming our protests at the British Government. We in Ireland
              can enact a lot as a unified country, and make great savings in
              many ways at local and national level, no matter what the British
              Government do. The British Government have no particular interest
              in us in any part of Ireland. They work to their own agenda —
              &quot;at home&quot;, as they call it — and they will never do
              anything to make life more sustainable for us here.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney said that the field had been well
              and truly ploughed. I would like to harrow the field a little
              longer. I am concerned that the Labour Government’s policy of
              indirect, or stealth, taxation is contributing to a ridiculous
              situation where we pay 48·8p duty on a litre of petrol. It seems
              a lot. A litre is the size of a carton of fruit juice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is bad enough, but the Government then
              proceed to charge VAT on this part of the fuel costs. The taxation
              system is biased against motorists in many ways, but this double
              taxation is iniquitous.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Conservative Government were originally to
              blame for introducing tax on fuel at 5% above the inflation rate.
              They thought that this would be played out after a number of
              years. Then the Labour Government discovered that this was an easy
              way of lining their coffers. They went one better and added 6%
              above inflation. These increases have been subject to double
              taxation by applying VAT in addition. If this double taxation were
              stopped, 8p per litre could be knocked off the price of fuel
              immediately.</p>

              consumers in farming, haulage and business, and I press the
              Westminster Government to address this issue in their November
              Budget review. I am deeply concerned about the plight of owners of
              filling stations. This has been mentioned in regard to border
              areas, but the problem has spread out from these areas as people
              increasingly realise that they can go across the border to fill
              up. The owners have seen their fuel sales drop because they have
              got dubious cheap fuels, and across the border fuel is cheaper
              again.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our rural community comprises many facets, and

              rural economy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have pleasure in supporting the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the general sentiments expressed by
              all Members who have spoken in the debate and congratulate
              Mr&nbsp;Beggs and Mr&nbsp;Dodds on bringing forward this motion.
              Several people, including myself, have been lobbying on this issue
              for two years. We have focused in particular on the damage that
              the disparity in excise duty is causing to petrol retailers in the
              border area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my constituency of West Tyrone a number of
              filling stations have closed over the last two years, including
              five in Omagh, four in Strabane and at least 10 others throughout
              the rural area. Petrol retailers feel totally exasperated. They
              feel that they have been acting as tax collectors on the cheap.
              Currently a petrol retailer receives a margin of 2p per litre. The
              oil company gets 16p per litre and the Government gets
              60p&nbsp;to&nbsp;65p per litre. Therefore the petrol retailer has
              a legitimate case when he feels that he is only a tax collector.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sad reality is that, in the border zone
              from Derry to Newry and 25&nbsp;miles inside the Northern side,
              people are exercising their choice. They travel to the South in
              private motor cars to fill up. Many haulage companies also do
              this. I know one company with a fleet of lorries which saves
              £2,000 per week in fuel bills by purchasing its diesel south of
              the border. People are making an economic choice and,
              legitimately, they are purchasing much cheaper fuel.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of smuggling has been emphasised.
              This is a problem, and no doubt there is a smugglers’ paradise
              for those who transport fuel deeper into Northern Ireland. This
              emphasises the gross disparity and the gross distortion to normal
              trade patterns which has greatly affected jobs in Northern
              Ireland. I cannot comprehend why the Treasury feels that it is
              marginal to sacrifice £200&nbsp;million per year in loss of
              excise duty and VAT on fuel. Mr&nbsp;McGrady, Mr&nbsp;Gallagher
              and myself went over to meet a junior Treasury Minister last year.
              The Treasury officials seemed nonplussed that about
              £200&nbsp;million on average was being lost. The reality is that
              in Northern Ireland this is not a marginal issue. It is a major
              issue which affects many filling stations and road haulage
              companies, as well as small manufacturing and distribution
              businesses that use their own vehicles for delivery.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference has been made to getting our
              neighbours in the Republic to increase their excise duties to make
              them in line with ours. I do not understand the economic logic of
              that, although there may be a political one. I have no doubt that
              now there is such a lobby in the Republic, there will be a further
              reduction in excise duties there over the next year. I think that
              the political pressure is such that the Government will reduce it.
              Consumers in Northern Ireland should not be the only ones to bear
              the burden and pain of high excise duties; our neighbours in the
              Republic should be asked to do likewise. The real issue here is
              that we need to get the Chancellor and the Treasury to recognise
              that the inelastic demand response to high excise duties for the
              last 26 years can no longer be tolerated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1974, OPEC target oil prices quadrupled from
              $4 to $16 a barrel. In 1978, the target price increased to $28,
              and within the last 10 years the target price increased to $32.
              However, for the last 20 years the spot price of crude oil has
              averaged somewhere between $10 and $15 a barrel, which is not an
              exorbitant increase from the $4 a barrel in 1974.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1974 the average retail price of petrol and
              diesel was under 50p a gallon; it is currently almost £4 a
              gallon. It is not difficult to realise that it is not the oil
              companies that are ripping us off — unfortunately it is the
              Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can understand the logic, in environmental
              terms, of having high excise duties and VAT on fuel if the revenue
              were being directed into public transport in order to provide an
              alternative mode of transport, but only 15 % of the total fuel tax
              revenue goes towards public transport. We have been fed an
              illusory argument for a long time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the meantime industry in Northern Ireland
              has suffered a major economic handicap. Because of our peripheral
              location it is virtually impossible for it to compete today while
              the high excise duties continue. I feel very sympathetic towards
              the road haulage companies. For many years Northern Ireland had a
              large road haulage industry, but it is shrinking, almost weekly,
              at the moment. We cannot compete.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remember the time when Montgomery Transport
              Ltd, Woodside Haulage Ltd, Dukes Transport Ltd, Omagh Freight,
              Kelly Freight, Carna Transport Ltd and others had large fleets of
              lorries on the roads, but those fleets are getting smaller,
              because they cannot compete. As several Members said, many lorries
              are now being registered in the Republic, and that is
              disadvantaging our local regional economy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am extremely sorry for the legitimate road
              haulier or petrol retailer who feels unfairly treated as a result
              of Government policy. This Assembly does not have control over
              this issue; it is a reserved matter for Westminster.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like the Northern Ireland MPs to get
              together and make known the adverse impact high excise fuel duties
              are having on our industries.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many parts of Northern Ireland are almost
              becoming an economic wasteland owing to this issue. The punt/pound
              differential is adding another 20% to 25% to our local industry
              costs. It is virtually impossible to compete when there is such a
              disparity in the exchange rate along the border zone. That begs
              the question of how long the situation can continue? Many in the
              manufacturing and retail sectors say it is impossible to see
              beyond the next six months. Action is needed urgently.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Earlier I referred to the five filling stations
              in Omagh and four in Strabane. They not only sold petrol and
              diesel, but they also had shops, and some of them sold tyres. That
              has all gone. I know family-owned businesses that want to remain
              in business, but which are being put in a terrible dilemma because
              of the product they are being offered for sale. The Assembly
              should not expect legitimate businesses such as these to suffer
              that dilemma any longer.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the debate, and I support the motion.
              Indeed, the motion deserves the support of us all. The debate has
              been interesting. I listened with incredulity, along with every
              other Member, to Mr&nbsp;Birnie’s gambit for Irish unity by
              suggesting that petrol prices should be inflated across the
              island. However, I do not know how that would be received in other
              parts of this island.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the serious aspect of this debate, much
              energy and anger has been directed, rightly, at the Prime Minister
              and the Chancellor. They claimed that the protests will not make
              them change the level of fuel tax. They have treated those people
              who tried to indicate the level of public outrage and concern felt
              at the unjustifiably high level of duty on fuel with contempt. The
              Prime Minister said that it would be harmful to democracy and that
              he would not be bullied by the protestors.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most people here believe that the Prime
              Minister has not been consistent on this issue of bullying. We
              have heard across this House that the Prime Minister is prepared
              to be bullied by other people in this Province — by the very
              people whose organisations are engaged in the illegal smuggling
              and trading of fuel. Yet he claims that he will not be bullied by
              the protestors.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Prime Minister has called for proper and
              sensible debate. He says that there is a proper way to do things
              in the United Kingdom. Today, we are having a proper debate. We
              are telling the Prime Minister and the Chancellor that the rate of
              duty on fuel is excessive and it must come down. The reasons have
              been enunciated across the Floor — it is having a harmful impact
              on many industries, farmers, and ordinary householders who use
              fuel and who use petrol in their cars.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Prime Minister asked for a proper debate,
              but is he listening? He asked for a debate on the issue and now
              one devolved region of the United Kingdom is having one. The Prime
              Minister should now respond positively to this debate. His failure
              to do so will only indicate that he is storing up more trouble
              ahead. I believe that a failure to respond will only force
              protestors back onto the streets in order to squeeze a response
              from him over the winter months.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inconvenience that we witnessed across the
              United Kingdom last week was minor compared to what it could have
              been if this protest had taken place in the heart of winter and in
              the very cold of the Outer Hebrides or parts of Northern Ireland.
              People would then have realised that Mr Tony Blair could be
              building up his very own winter of discontent. If he is not
              prepared to listen or to respond positively at this time, he is
              making further protests inevitable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have rightly said that Northern Ireland
              is doubly disadvantaged because of the land border with the
              Republic of Ireland and the difference in duty there. Across the
              entire European Union, even where prices are more than 30% lower
              than in the United Kingdom, people are outraged that the price
              paid to Government for this vital fuel and resource is so high.
              Government policy on fuel tax is daylight robbery.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Look at some of the facts produced by the
              cross-party group that met in Northern Ireland last week. Fuel
              accounts for 35% of hauliers’ operating costs. Fuel costs for
              farmers and fishermen have increased by 110% in the past 12
              months. Derv prices are 83% higher in Northern Ireland than in the
              Republic of Ireland. That difference does not appear to be
              affected by the fact that the price of crude oil is the same in
              both countries. Official sales of fuel in Northern Ireland are
              down 42% in the last year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not too strong to say that Government
              policy on this issue is daylight robbery. It is robbery that works
              against the robber. Across Northern Ireland, retailers tell me
              that there is a massive incentive to smuggle fuel because the
              price differential is so big. If the Government set a more modest
              level of duty, we would find that the risks and penalties
              associated with smuggling were not worth the while of the
              smuggler.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is because of the price differential and the
              massive profits associated with this illegal trade that smuggling
              of petrol and, for that matter, cigarettes and tobacco is so
              common in Northern Ireland. The onus is on the Government to
              reduce excise duties so that it is not worthwhile for the smuggler
              to face those penalties because he cannot make the same profit and
              the same rich pickings that he is making now.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Across the United Kingdom the public do not
              feel guilty about purchasing smuggled fuel. We should face up to
              that. Most retailers will tell you that 73% of what is going into
              the car goes to the Government. Many people are of the view that
              the only person benefiting is a fat- cat Chancellor. It is not the
              ordinary retailer who is trying to make a living for himself and
              his family. There appears to be no tangible benefit to our roads
              from fuel tax.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are those who argue that we will
              eventually see environmental improvements. The Road Haulage
              Association has produced statistics claiming that when a 40-tonne
              lorry delivers goods to a supermarket, it requires 500 cars to
              take that same amount of goods away. It goes on to say that
              whether we like it or not, even if rail freight grew by 300% over
              the next 10 years, more than 85% of goods would still have to be
              moved by road. Therefore, the environmental argument that this
              money will eventually see its way into better means of transport
              is complete and total nonsense.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government have a fundamental issue to deal
              with. Do they want to raise tax for its own sake or do these
              inflated tax demands have a purpose? Are the Government going to
              continue to insist on this high tax despite the fact that across
              the United Kingdom people are crying out against it? The European
              Union is mentioned in this motion. If the European Union means
              anything, then it could have bargained a deal with the
              oil-producing nations that would have resulted in lower fuel
              prices for all European citizens.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The failure of the Governments in the so-called
              partnership of Europe to bring about such a harmonised policy on
              fuel tax highlights the giant failure of the entire European
              experiment. It has failed its citizens on one of the most
              practical social and economic issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The United Kingdom Government must come up with
              a policy and a level of duty that ensures a vital resource is not
              priced at a luxury price but at a price that equates with its
              necessity.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member says that the European Union has
              failed the citizens of Europe. Does he agree that there is not the
              same sort of problem in continental Europe as in the United
              Kingdom?</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am amazed by that statement, considering the
              violent protests in France over the last few weeks and the
              outbreak in Belgium, where fuel duty is low at 19.2%. The whole of
              the European Parliament has been brought to a halt this very week.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fuel duty which the United Kingdom
              Government and Governments across Europe impose on their citizens
              is unjustifiably high. It is unreasonable to ask people to pay
              that amount of duty. Wages do not inflate at the same rate. If the
              Government do not respond positively to the minimal protest that
              we have witnessed in the last few days, there will be a maximal
              protest that could cause widespread concern across the whole of
              Europe.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I
              support the motion although, having listened to some UUP and DUP
              Members from across the Floor, I began to wonder if we were not
              rerunning the decommissioning argument because there was so much
              talk about paramilitarism and republicanism. It is worth
              remembering that to address the effect of the present crisis and
              not the cause is to devalue the crisis and to devalue the debate.
              We are talking about the iniquitous inequalities in fuel prices.
              So far as this part of the island is concerned, the only long-term
              way to address this problem, as with other problems, is to
              harmonise taxes across the island.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is nothing new about smuggling, a Cheann
              Comhairle, and there is nothing new about poor men becoming rich
              through smuggling. Many of the poor men who became rich were not
              Republicans and did not belong to the Republican community. Since
              partition the border has generated an economy of its own,
              depending on whatever commodity was scarce. I remember when it was
              butter, then it was tea, then it was cattle and then it was pigs;
              other times it was alcohol. You cannot blame the effect without
              looking at the cause. It has been disappointing to listen to those
              who proposed the motion engaging in opportunistic party politics.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Cheann Comhairle, we must address the
              fundamental issue that has bedevilled this island since partition.
              That is the lack of harmonisation of taxes and other tax-raising
              devices. Germany, France and Italy were able to harmonise and
              lessen the impact of the hardships caused by different prices,
              especially of fuel and related commodies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also worth remembering, a Cheann
              Comhairle, that there is a global aspect to this. The British
              Government have, in their way, contributed to this crisis by
              acceding to OPEC demands to control the supply of crude oil. There
              is a global dimension as well as a local dimension.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To reiterate — and I am not just making a
              political point — it makes economic sense, if we co-exist on
              this island, to harmonise taxes if for whatever reasons we need
              that harmonisation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr&nbsp;Birnie’s suggestion that one solution
              might be for the Southern Government to raise their taxes to
              harmonise with ours is almost too ludicrous for words. I would
              have thought that the all-Ireland Ministerial Council would be
              looking at, as we have said, the harmonising of the tax regime in
              the two parts of the island.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a problem that causes anomalies in the
              Province. In Donegal there were protests when retailers there
              increased the cost of petrol and diesel at the pumps — prices
              were higher than in the rest of the island. People in Donegal,
              within the Province, had to protest against that iniquitous rise
              in their fuel prices — so it causes problems right across the
              board.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have talked about the agriculture and road
              haulage sectors, but another sector which is seriously
              disadvantaged by this crisis comprises those who use home heating
              oil — particularly the elderly and the unemployed. On
              27&nbsp;September&nbsp;1999, 900&nbsp;litres of home heating oil
              cost £127; on 18&nbsp;September&nbsp;2000, 900&nbsp;litres of oil
              cost £230 — a price rise of £103. That is an increase of more
              than 100%.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our attempts to alleviate the problems of
              the haulage industry and the agriculture sector, we should also
              look seriously and urgently at the way in which ordinary domestic
              consumers using home heating oil are possibly trebly
              disadvantaged. They may have a car, or the husband might have a
              van that he uses for his business on which he is paying extra fuel
              tax. Then, just to keep themselves warm, they are paying over 100%
              more than they did last year. This is particularly relevant for
              the older members of our community. A Cheann Comhairle, I want to
              conclude by saying that I am not just making a political point,
              but the only solution, not only to the fuel crisis but to other
              crises that will arise in the future, is to have a harmonisation
              of tax and duty taxes throughout the island of Ireland.</p>

              brief, and I do not think I need dwell on the well- rehearsed
              issues that have been raised, both in the Chamber and outside, by
              the hauliers and farmers who have come here today. Their plight
              has been documented on our television screens over the last few
              days, and everyone is aware of the issues. We are well aware of
              the precarious position of our farmers, our fishermen, our road
              hauliers, our petrol retailers in the border areas, and of those
              mentioned by Mr&nbsp;John&nbsp;Kelly a moment ago, domestic
              consumers, particularly the elderly, who have to depend on this

              out of sandwiches because of the fuel crisis on the mainland is
              shocking when sandwiches could be made just round the corner. What
              sort of society is this that we depend so much on fuel in this
              way?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those taxes that are raised should be used for
              investment in alternative clean energy sources such as solar, wind
              and biomass et cetera to reduce our over- dependence on fossil
              fuels. Secondly, they should also be used to support strategies,
              initiatives and incentives to reduce CO2 emissions and encourage
              imaginative ideas such as car sharing and other ways of reducing
              the traffic on our roads. Finally, we desperately need investment
              in our public transport system, and particularly in the railways.
              Those are issues that the Government should look at.</p>

              Can you confirm that one of the reasons was that the First

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not infrequent for Ministers to explore
              the possibility of making a statement and then not make that
              statement, for all sorts of reasons — timetabling or whatever.
              Explanations are not normally given. My understanding is that the
              statement has not been cancelled. It is simply not being made
              today. It will be for the First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister to decide whether to beg leave to make that statement at
              a later stage.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Mr Mallon):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 29&nbsp;June, just one month after taking
              office again, we announced our agenda for Government, setting out
              early actions which would be taken across the range of the
              Executive’s responsibilities in the remainder of this year. The
              Programme for Government will focus on the longer-term. During the
              summer, the Executive Committee had initial discussions about the
              broad nature, principles and structure of the Programme for
              Government. It also consulted Assembly Committees, social partners
              and other stakeholders in our public services on their views on
              the key priorities of this programme. The consultative exercises
              have been valuable in helping to inform the development of the
              draft programme. As part of the consultation process, a conference
              has been arranged for 2&nbsp;October with social partners and a
              range of other stakeholders in key public services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government is a completely
              new development in the administration of Northern Ireland. It will
              provide a clear understanding of what is expected from the
              Executive as a whole in terms of policies and programmes. The
              programme will take a Government- wide view and not be based on a
              series of departmental inputs. We will continue to work further on
              the programme in the coming weeks with the intention of submitting
              a draft of the associated Budget proposals to the Assembly in
              mid-October for consideration.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Thursday, Ministers will be taking a half
              day away from the office to develop the programme further. It is
              our intention to provide a six-week period for the Assembly to
              scrutinise the programme.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Deputy First Minister’s
              statement and thank him for its content. Does he agree that the
              people of Northern Ireland are eagerly awaiting the contents of
              the Programme for Government because they want to see this
              devolved Administration deliver real change and a better standard
              of living for all sections of the people?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister accept that an integrated
              Programme for Government, incorporating an agreed approach among
              Departments, is essential, so that the people can feel the impact
              and experience the net benefits of better public services and job
              prospects? Finally, can the Minister outline how he envisages that
              the negotiation machinery will operate to collectively agree a
              Programme for Government given the political challenge that this
              poses when two Ministers are somewhat detached from the Executive?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his questions. I agree
              that the people of the North of Ireland, and indeed this Assembly,
              await the Programme for Government with considerable interest. It
              is crucial to have the collective view of the Executive as to
              where it will be going and the type of policy positions it will
              adopt. I believe that a wide range of policies can only have real
              impact if we think beyond departmental barriers, and if a number
              of Departments bring their resources to bear in a co-ordinated
              way. That is the only way to deal with many of the stubborn social
              and economic problems that we face.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government provides a major
              opportunity to address this type of issue and to signal how we
              will work together in the Executive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the latter part of the question,
              the Programme for Government will be the collective will of the
              Executive, and a party which does not participate in Executive
              meetings can hardly expect to bring the same influence to bear on
              it as those which do.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister could not even agree on writing a statement on their
              visit to the White House last week — mainly because the Deputy
              First Minister once again made a fool of the First Minister on the
              issue of policing. Given that, can the Deputy First Minister tell
              the Assembly what chance there is of an agreed Programme for
              Government that will have to accommodate the policies of IRA/Sinn
              Féin? It is part of the Executive because of the weakness of the
              First Minister’s party in admitting it in the first place.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister claims that DUP Ministers
              are sitting down with Sinn Féin in government to agree a
              Programme for Government. Would the Deputy First Minister confirm
              to the House that that is not the case?</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can say very clearly to the Member — and I
              think that this is what is at the heart of his question — that
              the DUP Ministers are not pulling their weight collectively in the
              Executive. I can assure him of that. That is a tragedy. It is sad
              for the Executive and for the entire community. However, I have to
              say that the collective element within the Programme for
              Government is not something that anybody should take pride in
              staying outside of — because by staying outside one is actually
              staying outside the needs of all of the people of the North of
              Ireland. Rather than taking pleasure or expressing pride in the
              refusal to be part of the collective decision-making process and
              of sharing collective responsibility, people should be looking at
              their positions and asking themselves how best they, as a party
              and its Ministers, can contribute to the welfare of everyone in
              the North of Ireland.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An integrated Programme for Government would be
              welcome, in view of the substantive debate which was taking place
              earlier today and which is to be continued. How does the Deputy
              First Minister intend to bring forward an integrated transport
              programme to address some of the concerns mentioned earlier, in
              the absence of the Minister responsible?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his question to which
              there are two obvious parts. We are all aware of the damage that
              has been done in relation to the question of fuel prices. We are
              unique in Northern Ireland — not only do we have the high burden
              of taxation, we also have the factors that derive from the border
              between North and South.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second thing is in relation to the
              substantial elements of transport. It is crucial that we get this
              right and that we all agree in budgetary and policy terms how to
              deal with the problem. An example would be the issue of transport
              in terms of the British/Irish Council meeting. Have we seen the
              DUP Minister make any contribution to that? It will also be a
              matter for serious consideration at the next North/South
              Ministerial Council plenary session in Dublin. Will we have a DUP
              input there? No, of course we will not. This Executive, in its
              collectivity, will have to take on board those decisions that will
              be made about transport and other issues. It cannot be allowed to
              act to the detriment of people in the North of Ireland because of
              a political party’s policy stance, rather than the political
              input by Ministers.</p>

              have been a bit more honest. Is it not a scandal for the First
              Minister to admit by implication — for he would not do so in his

              want to have to repeat that demonstration, but those parties who

              people, students, members of minority religions, those dealing
              with sexual orientation and health professionals. We asked all the
              consortia to deal with each matter raised in the representations
              and with other issues. I hope we will find that this has happened

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Funding for the range of project work
              undertaken by women’s centres comes from a wide variety of
              sources both public and private but mainly from European Union
              programmes, health and social services trusts, the Training and
              Employment Agency, the National Lottery, charitable trusts and
              private sector sponsorship. Current public sector funding includes
              £60,000 European social fund assistance to support IT training
              for women, £37,000 from the European social fund and £5,000 from
              the European regional development fund for Belfast Women’s
              Training Services employment link project. In addition to this,
              the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety
              provides grants to support specific projects amounting to a total
              of almost £800,000.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The responsibility of the Office of the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister is for policy development
              in relation to women’s issues. In 1998 the women’s support
              network commissioned research on the women’s centres. The
              research was funded by the Equality Commission. The report has
              been produced but has not yet been approved by the Equality
              Commission and the group managing the research. A meeting with the
              junior Ministers in the Office of the First Minister and the
              Deputy First Minister has been arranged for Tuesday
              19&nbsp;September 2000. It should be noted that, at this time, no
              provision exists for the Office of the First Minister and the
              Deputy First Minister to fund women’s centres.</p>

              future of many women’s groups, including those well established,
              is now in grave jeopardy because of the present difficulties with
              European funding. Many well-established groups have been turned
              down by the National Lottery, and I ask that that be discussed at

              the point that she makes with regard to gap funding, but she will
              recall that, when we announced the agenda for Government earlier
              this year, £2 million was made available to bridge gaps in
              European Union funding for some voluntary bodies between
              programmes. The funders, including central Government Departments,
              have prioritised the applications for gap funding. There are a
              total of 924 applications, including some from women’s centres,
              and the applicants are presently being notified of the outcome.</p>

              issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to gender, in the Office of the
              First Minister and the Deputy First Minister a gender policy unit
              was established in July to take forward cross-departmental policy
              and strategy development relating to gender equality. The new unit
              will act as a liaison point with the extensive network of non-
              governmental organisations in this area, especially with women’s
              groups. It will also contribute expertise on equality in relation
              to gender, sexual orientation, dependants and marital status, and
              provide advice and guidance to Departments with regard to
              monitoring their policies for equality in those areas, and will

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the Northern Ireland Civil
              Service, as of January 1999 the overall gender breakdown was 52%
              male and 48% female. For a variety of reasons, many of them

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Analysis in Northern Ireland last year, based,

              indicated that we would significantly exceed that target. In March
              2000 the target was changed, the emphasis now being that 25% of
              all key services should be capable of being delivered by 2002,
              increasing to 100% in 2005. &quot;Key services&quot; are defined
              as those which result in a high number of transactions with
              citizens, provide high-value services to citizens or businesses or
              oblige the citizen or business to transact with the public sector
              — for example, the payment of road tax. As with other devolved
              Administrations, we are reviewing key services to ensure that our
              targets are appropriate to Northern Ireland. In consultation with
              the Departments who will deliver these services, we shall prepare

              including the painting of kerbstones and road fixtures, is
              prevalent throughout Northern Ireland. Measures were introduced to
              prohibit such painting. It is an offence, under the Roads
              (Northern Ireland) Order 1993, for any person without lawful
              authority, to paint on public roads, kerbstones or other road
              fixtures. Prohibition of painting on public properties, whether
              they be roads, kerbstones or other property belonging to the
              Department is not a problem that my Department alone can resolve.
              It will require a general consensus and strong local support. The
              Roads Service will, however, remove graffiti or sectarian symbols
              erected illegally on its property that are a danger to road users.
              Where there is no danger we will seek to remove such material on
              the advice of the RUC and where there is strong local support. To
              act without local support is likely to lead to a proliferation of
              such material and put at risk the safety of staff tasked with the

              a matter for his Department; it is a general problem facing the
              community. The laissez-faire attitude adopted by the Department,
              which is represented in his answer, simply allows the
              reinforcement of sectarian attitudes and the concept of sectarian
              territoriality in our society. It continues the rather offensive
              practice of painting kerbs, which is off-putting to potential
              investors, particularly in urban areas, and leads to greater
              problems for the various communities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that local communities should
              in some way give their consent. Is the Minister in a position to
              investigate how local communities could be effectively and
              properly consulted? This would allow them to give their opinion on
              this rather primitive and sectarian practice of daubing pavements,

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First of all, I will reiterate the attitude of
              my Department, and it is not a laissez-faire attitude: any illegal
              painting of kerbstones and road fixtures should to be removed
              where possible. The Member has had some previous correspondence on
              this with my Department, and they have described to him how
              measures have already been put in place to remove some of the
              graffiti he refers to.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How local communities might come together to
              try to further this cause is something that will have a much wider
              remit than that of the Department for Regional Development. My
              Department has a functional responsibility to remove the graffiti,
              on advice from the RUC, where it is a hazard to road users,
              bearing in mind the safety of the staff tasked to carry that out.
              How we get local communities to come together to agree on the
              necessity of having it removed is a matter of much wider concern.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A bridge over the Victoria Channel, or a tunnel
              under it, and all the associated connecting roads would cost
              several hundred million pounds. These funds are not available to
              my Department’s Roads Service. Although a bridge or tunnel would
              have time savings for traffic on the M2 bound for Bangor and North
              Down, and vice versa, such a scheme would not have a positive cost
              benefit. It could not be justified when compared to the need for
              higher priority schemes across Northern Ireland. The need for such
              a scheme has, to some extent, been obviated by the construction in
              recent years of the Lagan Bridge, which links the M1 and M2 with
              the Sydenham bypass by way of the M3.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his answer, but I
              would be a little concerned that officials may have provided him
              with rather scanty research information. Is he aware that some
              3,000&nbsp;acres of underused land — land with vast economic
              potential — lie between the city of Belfast and the sea?
              Approximately 2,000 of those 3,000&nbsp;acres are in the
              possession of the Port of Belfast and were the subject of the ad
              hoc Committee inquiry some months ago. Is the Minister aware that
              there are a further 1,000&nbsp;acres that could be used for
              development? Does he not agree that it is essential for the
              prosperity of Greater Belfast that this land be opened up? Perhaps
              it could be developed along similar lines to the Foyle Bridge in
              his native city or the toll bridge in Dublin — or to a number of
              other examples in places along the east coast of the United States
              of America.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that such a bridge
              would not be solely for travel from one place to another, but that
              it would help to open up that area, giving people sight of those
              3,000 acres of land and access to them? I am aware of, and perhaps
              agree with the Minister on, the amount of money that might be
              involved. However, I disagree with him on the benefits involved. I
              believe that the benefits would outweigh the cost. Does the
              Minister not agree that a feasibility study would be beneficial in
              this case, with the emphasis on the opening up of the land as much
              as on the transport use?</p>

              the underutilisation of the 3,000&nbsp;acres. However, dealing
              with the specific issue of the construction of a bridge, the
              design and construction of such a bridge would be very difficult
              given the need to maintain shipping headroom in the Victoria
              Channel before descending to road level at Airport Road West. A
              large span suspension bridge might be possible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The presence of the adjacent Belfast City
              Airport would impose additional strength requirements on the
              bridge piers, however, to cover the risk of aircraft collision.
              There would be massive difficulties, not least of which are the
              several hundred million pounds that is unavailable in my present

              of awarding the contract for the ferry at Strangford. The Roads
              Service budget for the replacement ferry was set at £3 million.
              Tenders were invited and the lowest tender was within this budget
              price at £2·6 million. It was well within the target. Harland
              and Wolff also tendered for the contract, but its tender price was
              considerably in excess of the budget. EU guidelines are quite
              specific on value for money. I had no alternative but to award the
              contract to the Merseyside firm. This is good news for Strangford

              ensure that the Water Service continues to deliver an efficient
              operational service within its budget. Programmes have included

              work being contracted out and some retained in-house through
              successful bids. This mixed economy allows comparison between
              in-house and contracted-out activities. Historically, private

              operations in a range of activities. The main activities that were
              originally carried out in-house and have moved to the private

              maintenance, road reinstatement, painting and decorating, and
              reservoir cleaning. A significant proportion of sludge tankering,
              sewer maintenance, street furniture repairs, service pipe repairs

              contracted out. I think that the list is longer than the one
              given. Can the Minister supply a total breakdown of all the work
              that has been contracted out by all divisions of the Water
              Service?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that continually
              contracting out Water Service work will have a serious effect on
              jobs in the Water Service? There is serious concern about this.
              How many employees were in the Water Service five years ago, and
              how many are there today? A considerable number of employees of
              the Water Service are no longer there, and that is a worry to the
              whole workforce.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a difficult area. It concerns many
              people. In March 1999 the National Radiological Protection Board
              was asked to set up an independent expert working group to assess
              the current state of research into possible health risks from
              mobile phones. I want to emphasise that all mobile
              telecommunications masts are subject to planning control. Masts
              over 15 metres in height require my Department’s express
              planning permission under the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order
              1991. Most telecommunication masts under 15 metres are permitted
              development under the Planning and General Development (Northern
              Ireland) Order 1993. My Department’s prior approval is required
              only on location and design</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the prior approval procedure my
              Department has 42&nbsp;days within which to issue a decision on
              applications for ground-based masts, and 28&nbsp;days for all
              other types of telecommunications equipment. I cannot say that I
              will be withdrawing any already granted approval, to answer
              Mr&nbsp;McGrady. The consultation paper will be issued before the
              end of October and will include a draft planning policy statement
              setting out the Department’s proposed policies for
              telecommunications development. The difficulty, and this applies
              to all Members is that many of us carry mobile phones around with
              us. If we were not getting good communications there would be a
              real hullabaloo. I take the point that there are great fears in
              the community about health risks.</p>

              take and when does he hope to bring a report back to the Assembly?
              Also, will the concerns of local people be taken into account?
              What part will they play in the consultation process in relation
              to planning applications being granted? In the past, many people

              a draft planning policy statement, and this will take a little
              time to develop. I can see it happening early in the new year. The
              Northern Ireland consultation will include a draft planning policy
              statement, and this has inevitably taken some time to develop.
              However, this should assist the consultation. Applicants for
              planning permission to erect telecommunications masts are entitled
              to have my Department make a determination. It would not be proper
              to postpone this decision-making process pending the development
              of planning policy in this area. I want to emphasise again that we
              are very concerned with it, but it does not all come under the
              Planning Service. There are health issues involved as well. So
              there are a couple of Departments involved in this.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This issue is one which greatly concerns many
              people and, as the Minister has already said, there are health
              implications. Therefore I find it rather sad that there is a
              dismissive attitude, that we cannot do this, that and the other
              thing, while people’s health is being put at risk. I say that as
              one who does not and will not carry a mobile phone. Does the
              Minister not agree that the ease with which these mobile
              telecommunications masts get planning permission, particularly
              under the prior approval procedures, has led to a proliferation of
              the masts throughout Northern Ireland, and that this in turn is
              creating radiation smog which is endangering the health of the
              entire community? What is he, as Minister, going to do to ensure
              that the voice of the people is listened to in their strong
              objections to such a proliferation of these masts? Is he further
              aware that, even when a council unanimously objects to the
              planning permission being granted for such masts, the Department
              goes ahead willy-nilly and grants permission over the head of the
              people and its elected representatives? Surely he would agree with
              me that this is no way in which such a serious issue should be
              dealt with.</p>

              I have got to make that point. As I said earlier, in answer to
              Mr&nbsp;McGrady, health issues are the responsibility of the
              Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. Advice
              provided by that Department is that in areas readily accessible to
              the public there is no convincing evidence of a causal link
              between health risk and exposure to electromagnetic fields
              associated with mobile telecommunications masts. Any further
              advice or guidelines will be fully taken into account by the

              I also endorse the concept of a living and working countryside as
              set out in the draft regional strategic framework and agree that
              we should seek to promote a strong mixed-use rural economy. For
              example, in 1999-2000, 86% of applications for new houses in the

              The Planning Service is generally confined to a facilitating role

              in Northern Ireland are dealt with more severely than others, and
              my view is that those statistics shield that. Does the Minister
              agree that centralist Department strategists have an urban mindset
              which militates against the rural dweller being able to live, work
              and rear his children in areas of special control and outstanding
              natural beauty? These classifications make it fairly difficult for
              farmers to look after their families properly in those areas. Does
              the Minister agree that what we all need to do is to inject more
              of the rural thinking into the Department’s decision-making?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his statement. I am not
              so sure what the question was. I am fully aware of the
              difficulties, and I sympathise with them, but we have to work as
              far as we possibly can within policy. The rural planning strategy
              also contains policy statements which aim to facilitate economic
              development and diversification in the rural economy, particularly
              in agriculture. There still is, within the policy, room for a
              retirement bungalow to be built on farmland. Sometimes one gets
              the impression that we are stifling every development. I know how
              difficult it is. I have stood at site meetings in the countryside,
              and I have questioned various decisions. However, I also take into
              consideration that people are adhering to planning policy. We do
              try to facilitate building where it is suitable, appropriate, and
              does not despoil the countryside.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement. It
              recognises the important issue that, in a relatively fixed total
              retail market, the GB multiple chains are doing great damage to
              the smaller, mainly independent, retailers in our town and city
              centres. Would the Minister agree that in developing a
              Departmental policy there should be some awareness of the
              competition aspect arising from locating out-of-town shopping
              centres near to town centres? They tend to be dominated by two
              major GB multiples, which now have a very large share of Northern
              Ireland’s total grocery market. That is potentially damaging the
              interests of consumers and the farming sector.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are big issues out there. There are
              issues of competition. The Department for Regional Development is
              undertaking a strategic review of PPS5 in the near future. That
              will afford an opportunity for the entire retail planning policy
              framework to be reconsidered. In the meantime, the planning
              service must work within the policy context provided by PPS5 and,
              where appropriate, the statutory development plans.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While retail planning policy is precautionary
              in respect of town centres, in principle it precludes retail
              development not outside town centres but inside the urban
              development limit, where the policy tests of PPS5 are met. These
              policy tests include consideration of the type of retailing
              proposed; the availability of suitable alternative sites in the
              town centre; the impact of the proposed development and a range of
              other more general material planning considerations. Consequently,
              there are circumstances when it is deemed appropriate for major
              retail developments such as retail warehousing to be located away
              from town.</p>

              Given that the D5 proposal was shown to affect not just town

              strategy in March, a number of key activities have taken place.
              Three waste management planning groups, comprising the 26 district
              councils, have formed and are progressing with preparing plans for
              a new waste infrastructure. Additionally, my officials have
              advanced work on the publication of a planning policy statement on
              waste management. My Department has requested district councils to
              indicate their proposals for dealing with essential interim
              capacity needs, pending the preparation of their waste management
              plans.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for that response, but is
              that a good enough situation to be in? The strategy was launched
              by Mr&nbsp;Howarth in March, during the period of suspension of
              devolution. During the last six months, the situation,
              particularly in the Greater Belfast area, has become ever more
              acute regarding the lack of available sites for waste dumping.
              There is no movement towards significant recycling schemes. There
              is no movement on additional landfill sites. Could the Minister
              please explain how quickly he expects councils to come up with
              proposals and why his Department has not expedited them?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The waste management strategy for Northern
              Ireland was, as Mr&nbsp;Ford stated, first published in
              March&nbsp;2000. The strategy must comply with the EU Waste
              Framework Directive and it is not something we take lightly. We
              must ensure that we are doing the right thing. The strategy is
              based on four key objectives — reducing the amount of waste
              generated; making the best use of the waste generated; encouraging
              practices that minimise the risk of environmental damage or harm
              to human health; and moving waste management practices towards
              reuse, recycling and recovery, with disposal in a landfill site as
              a last resort.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is expected that the strategy will create
              1,500 jobs. It is not going as fast as some people would like, but
              there is a lot involved requiring a lot of consideration. It will
              take time, and we are pursuing the matter as fast as we possibly
              can.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M Murphy:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the moment, we have a strategy of
              incineration proposals at local government level which is being
              progressively marketed by a very rich and highly powerful focused
              pressure group, financed by the plastic packaging and disposable
              waste industry. Will the Minister encourage the development of
              recycling and education on waste management especially when one
              remembers the opposition from Derry and Inishowen 10&nbsp;years
              ago to stop Du Pont in their tracks when they tried to build an
              incinerator? The people won then, and the people of this island do
              not want incineration. When one recognises the severe pollution
              already attributed to Sellafield, we do not need pollution from
              incineration.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect to incineration, nobody has said
              that there will be incineration although it is a possible option.
              Waste management plans brought forward by district council
              groupings will include an assessment of the contribution
              incineration may make to waste management in Northern Ireland and
              I will carefully consider the matter. Waste-to-energy is only one
              of a range of possible options identified in the strategy but
              specific assessments are a matter for each district council when
              preparing their waste management plan. This is a big issue — a
              tremendous issue — and, as I said earlier, it is one we would
              like to hasten as fast as we can. We have got to be careful what
              we do.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ultimately, waste has got to go somewhere. We
              want to reduce it. Part of the plan is to reduce the amount of
              waste going into landfill. Perhaps we will be able to dispense
              with landfill as far as possible. It will not be an easy task. All
              aspects will be taken into consideration. Our people are beavering
              away on it.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Would the Minister agree that the people of
              Northern Ireland are very good at creating waste, but not so good
              at understanding the consequences of disposing of it? One of the
              major contributions towards dealing with the waste problem in the
              long run would be a much greater public consciousness of the need
              to create less waste.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, indeed; it is a slow process. We are all
              somewhat careless about waste. Three quarters of us get rid of it;
              get it out to the bin; get it out of my way; not in my back yard;
              here we go. A long process of education is needed to get us to the
              point where we reduce, reuse, recycle and then dispose. This is a
              big issue confronting us.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This morning, Members quoted many statistics to
              support their contributions to the fuel debate. Had the subject
              matter been different, we would probably be bored by statistics by
              now. However, it is the sheer weight of evidence supported by the
              statistics that has made the debate on fuel so meaningful. There
              is no doubt that public concern is firmly focused on fuel prices.
              The price of diesel has doubled since the introduction of the fuel
              duty escalator in 1994. Twenty five per cent of the 60% increase
              since 1993 took place in 1999 alone. The last Budget opened the
              door very slightly by offering some help, although this still
              meant a 3·4% increase in duty. The Government, however, still
              failed to address the main issue of excessive fuel duty.
              Currently, excise duty on diesel is twice that which exists in any
              other European Union member state.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The United Kingdom has benefited hugely from
              the vast increase in oil prices. Revenues from North Sea oil,
              inclusive of VAT, must exceed all Budget predictions. Road
              hauliers believe that part of this windfall should be returned to
              the industry so that a degree of competitiveness can be restored.
              High fuel costs have a disproportionate impact on the road haulage
              industry, with fuel amounting to 36% of its total operating costs.
              The United Kingdom, and Northern Ireland in particular, depends
              heavily on an efficient haulage industry. Eighty one per cent of
              all domestic freight is carried by road. There are 65,000
              businesses in the United Kingdom operating eight vehicles over 3.5
              tons. There are over 25 million cars and 422,000 lorries over 3.5
              tons. The UK’s fiscal regime has disadvantaged a once thriving
              industry. These fiscal policies are causing acute and irreversible
              damage to the industry.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland, the majority of hauliers
              purchase their fuel in the Republic to enable their businesses to
              compete and survive. It is estimated that the total loss to the
              Treasury because of the refuelling of vehicles in the South and
              fuel smuggling is £350 million per year. The Government must, as
              the Government of the Republic have, recognise the economic
              importance of a strong and stable haulage industry. An accountancy
              firm has calculated that a windfall from rising oil prices means
              that the Chancellor of the Exchequer can afford to cut oil prices
              immediately by 8 pence per litre.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Treasury receives £330 million per year
              for every dollar rise in the price of world oil. It is estimated
              that by 2002 tax lost to the Exchequer through vehicles refuelling
              outside the United Kingdom will amount to one billion pounds. The
              gap in diesel fuel prices between the United Kingdom and the rest
              of the European Union is now so huge that one might describe it as
              laughable, were the implications not so serious.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The policy of the Government, and the previous
              Administration, was to pile taxes on fuel when oil prices were so
              low that the impact on costs was blunted. Now that the world oil
              prices have been readjusted inevitably upwards, the United Kingdom
              has been exposed. The Government must act now to stabilise the
              situation and create a level playing field, particularly with
              regard to the Republic of Ireland and other European Union member
              states.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will conclude with a simple illustration; I
              am holding five debit slips that represent five fills of fuel for
              my car and were made in Donegal, Cavan and Leitrim since July.
              That represents a saving to me of £55 or, in other words, a free
              fill of fuel. Multiply that by whatever factor is appropriate and
              you will see the enormity of the problem faced by our farmers,
              hauliers and fishermen. That simple illustration tells us much,
              and I support the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr O’Connor:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. This morning, on the way
              to this House, I paid 85·9 pence for each litre of diesel.
              Further up the road, I saw a sign pointing into the yard of a
              farm-type building advertising diesel on sale for 68 pence per
              litre. We are told that there is only 2 pence per litre profit on
              diesel so how can these people possibly sell it for 68 pence? It
              simply does not add up.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Earlier, Mr Dallat said that much of this is
              manufactured red diesel which has been chemically cleaned. That
              may be the case but we are told that there are something like 18
              customs officers throughout Northern Ireland to deal with what is
              an ever-growing problem, and I find it difficult to understand how
              we are ever going to deal with this problem head on. This is a
              problem all over Northern Ireland, and I am sure that all Members
              will, at some point on their way home, see a sign that blatantly
              advertises diesel at up to 20 pence per litre cheaper than that in
              petrol stations. This has led to the closure of over 60 petrol
              stations in Northern Ireland together with the jobs that they
              provided. And, it is happening in areas where a petrol station can
              provide a rural community with a shop for essentials.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first thing that we need to do is target
              the fraud aspect. I know that that is easier said than done, but
              the sale of illegal fuel has become so blatant that something must
              be done. We need to look at the situation and ask why people can
              be so blatant and get away with it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today a number of people from the road haulage
              industry and the agriculture industry came to Stormont to lobby
              Members. Most Members have received briefings from the CBI, the
              Anglo North Irish Fish Producers’ Organisation, the Ulster
              Farmers’ Union, et cetera, which are full of the statistics
              quoted earlier.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People care deeply about the situation. Mr Jim
              Wilson referred to the fact that 422,000 heavy goods vehicles are
              registered in the United Kingdom. That means 422,000 lorry
              drivers, not to mention the mechanics, transport clerks, fork-lift
              truck drivers, porters, and so on, needed to load and unload such
              vehicles. Those jobs will all be put at risk. We must send our
              products to Continental Europe, and if our transportation costs
              are so high that businesses are forced to use Continental
              transport in order to take them there, each one of those
              lorry-driving jobs could be taken by a European. They can buy
              their lorry and their diesel fuel more cheaply.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our business depends very much on the road
              transport industry. Everything we make that is sent out to Great
              Britain or Europe goes by road, for we have no rail links with
              anywhere else. Things have to go by ferry and road. We are heavily
              dependent on road transport and the road haulage industry, and we
              must see that industry being supported by a reduction in fuel
              costs to ensure that we, in Northern Ireland, can get our products
              into the European market competitively.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have talked much about motor fuel, but that
              is not the only fuel whose price has gone up. Mr John Kelly
              earlier referred to the cost of home heating oil, which has risen
              by over 100% in the last year or so. The most vulnerable people in
              society, those who have had their homes specially adapted to have
              oil — a non-manual heating system — installed for them because
              they were unfit to light fires, are now even more disadvantaged
              because of the high cost of heating fuel.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The British Government could afford to bring
              down the price of heating oil. It could, perhaps, also afford to
              bring down the cost of diesel to assist lorry drivers, but it is
              not just they who are suffering. Even ambulance services and the
              fire brigades are paying through the nose to provide an essential
              service to the community. We heard the Minister make a very
              welcome announcement last week that there would be an extra £50
              to cover winter fuel payments. However, because of the cost of
              home heating oil, that is grossly inadequate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this country we have a disability living
              allowance, of which Members will all be aware by now. There are
              care and mobility components. The mobility component is given to
              those who need transportation, who simply cannot get from A to B
              without difficulty. We have now reached the stage where people
              receive mobility money; they have a car, but because petrol is so
              costly, most of them cannot afford to fill it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation is getting worse and worse. Ms
              Morrice referred to our possible over dependence on oil, and that
              may well be the case, but that is the present state of affairs,
              and until such time as it changes fundamentally, I am afraid we
              shall have to live with it. I cannot see Gordon Brown changing
              things. Tony Blair came out in bullish form last week and said he
              would not be bullied.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, some of the oil companies were going to
              put their prices up again last week. The Government have got to
              the stage where they feel that because they have a majority, they
              can do no wrong. Some people within the Government are suffering
              from megalomania. They think that, no matter what they do, they
              are there forever. The people should tell them that they are not
              going to be there forever if they do not listen to what they want,
              and that includes our MPs in Parliament. The Government must
              listen. They have a duty to protect those people in our society
              who cannot afford heating oil, those who have to make a choice
              between heating and eating. It is not a nice situation to be in.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and thank Mr&nbsp;Beggs
              and Mr&nbsp;Dodds for bringing it forward. This matter needed to
              be aired as it has been today. I hope the Government pay heed to
              the will of the Assembly, because Northern Ireland is a special
              case. We are disadvantaged because people can go across the border
              and fill up. A lot of jobs have been lost because of that. In
              supporting the motion, I want to say that people in rural areas,
              where there is a lack of public transport, are being forced to use
              their cars because they have no other choice.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What made this protest on the mainland so
              different from other protests, such as the protest over the poll
              tax and the like, is that the people who were protesting were
              middle-class. They were not people looking for trouble or taking
              advantage of a situation; they were people with a genuine
              grievance. That was highlighted last week when the police moved in
              after a few days to let the tankers out. Some of the people
              questioned said &quot;No, we will not be fighting the police, we
              are law-abiding citizens&quot;. That made this protest different
              from the others. The British Government, in this instance, fell
              down by not reacting positively to the comments and needs of the
              people and the points they were trying to make. If
              Tony&nbsp;Blair, &quot;two Jags&quot; Prescott and Gordon Brown do
              not take note now, they will find themselves in a very serious
              position at the next election, and that is what they should be
              considering.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Different groups from industry were there also:
              the farmers, the hauliers, and the ordinary people who drive their
              car to and from work. Indeed, the emergency services were greatly
              hampered as a result. We should be looking at the needs of the
              people here and at the fact that the protests were made in a
              disciplined and dignified manner.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to highlight some of the different
              issues which impact on my constituency and on the people of the
              Province. Eighty per cent of the price of petrol and diesel
              purchased in garages goes straight into the coffers of central
              Government. While the United Kingdom has the most expensive diesel
              and petrol — and this is true of Northern Ireland especially —
              people in Belgium and other countries benefit from paying the
              correct price for fuel. This is the real problem: the Government
              are making so much off the backs of the people here from petrol
              and diesel taxes. We must try to reduce that, but how? Perhaps
              this motion today will highlight the issue — the Government will
              have to take notice of it. They cannot ignore it. They cannot be
              arrogant, pompous or put their head in the sand and just ignore
              what is happening.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would make two points. The first relates to
              the rural community, which I represent in the Ards Peninsula and
              in the Ards borough. It is very much a rural community, but it
              does take in some of the urban parts of the towns as well.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For many people living in the rural community
              the car is not a luxury, it is a necessity. It is important for
              those people who need it to get their children to school or who
              need to get to the shops. Indeed, some of those shops have closed
              as a result of the downturn in the agriculture industry. It is
              important that we focus on the impact on the rural community and
              how important the car is to them. Bus services do not always run
              at the time or to the place they would like, so the car can be
              their only way of getting about.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second point relates to the fishing
              industry. We all know about the dire implications for the fishing
              industry and we have highlighted issues in this Chamber before, as
              has the Minster. The fishing industry has experienced a downturn
              in the last six months and especially since the beginning of this
              year. While new quotas have come in from Europe, we have also seen
              restrictions on where people can fish. We have seen the directives
              coming through and which are tying up the boats.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have seen decommission, indeed the only
              decommission that has ever taken place is in the fishing industry.
              We have clearly seen some of the issues that are important to the
              fishing industry. While Government and EU Directives say that
              people cannot take boats out, that they cannot fish in places they
              used to, the fishing industry now finds itself impacted by the
              fuel increase.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the last few months, fuel and diesel for
              fishing boats increased by 50% — that is before you take the
              boat out of the harbour and before you pay the rest of your
              overheads. That is quite difficult for the fishing industry to
              take on board when it already feels the restrictions coming from
              Europe and elsewhere. Skippers must continue to purchase the
              necessary equipment to make businesses financially viable. At the
              same time, they are not able to compensate for the increase in
              diesel costs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A boat going out to sea at the present time —
              probably for the week — will cost about £1,000 to fill with
              fuel. That is a large proportion of any catch that you might make
              before the end of the week. It represents a very serious obstacle
              to making a successful business. Neither the Government nor the
              Fisheries Division at Stormont, have ever made any real effort to
              stand up for the rights of fishermen. They have simply acted as
              facilitators of EU legislation, which if unchallenged — and up
              to now it has been — will see our industry put to the sword. At
              the same time, devolution has not seen any change in the industry’s
              fortunes, with the Minister, while well intentioned, failing to
              make the voice of local industry heard. We need a strong voice for
              the fishing industry, which probably employs between 3,000 and
              4,000 people. Livelihoods in the villages of Portavogie, Ardglass,
              Kilkeel, Annalong and many other places are tied up in fishing.
              Many families’ lives and focus is on the fishing industry.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The French seem to be taking the lead in
              protesting against such behaviour and have made a number of moves
              to aid their fishing fleet. They have come up with a number of
              ideas. They have decreased corporation tax. They have decreased
              and taken away the landing duty and they have increased the
              benefits that can be given to fishermen and their families. While
              they are not directly subsidising the industry the French
              authorities are actively seeking a way in which to help the
              fishing industry, which is more than can be said of our Government
              and the Fisheries Division at Stormont.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have written to the Minister indicating some
              ways whereby assistance could be given to the fishing industry. I
              hope she may be able to make some movement. We have warned, over
              the last few years, about the fate of the local fishing industry.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As another nail is put into the coffin of the
              fishing industry, these warnings continue to go unheeded, and the
              Government seem determined to destroy a way of life which
              thousands of people depend on. Today we have tried to illustrate
              the different facets of industry, economy and lifestyle in
              Northern Ireland and how the rural community has been affected by
              this issue. The fishing industry, I believe, needs help as well.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McClarty:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout the past three years we have heard
              numerous calls from the Deputy Prime Minister, among others, to
              step out of our cars and get on to public transport. No one can
              ridicule such a plea. It makes good economic and environmental
              sense for an individual to decide to use public transport, be it
              bus or rail. There is something to be said for travelling to work
              in comfort, at speed and on time. In Northern Ireland, however, we
              cannot afford such a simple luxury — quite literally.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The railways task force interim report on the
              future of the railway network in Northern Ireland clearly sets out
              the cost of establishing a decent standard of rail service in
              Northern Ireland for the foreseeable future. We are under no
              illusions, therefore, as to the desperate situation of our rail
              network. In the meantime, in the absence of such an adequate and
              needful transport facility, the car is the main, and in some parts
              of the country, the only form of transportation available. In many
              respects, petrol is the lifeblood of our nation. Our dependence on
              it is absolutely vital for the Province’s economy to function
              properly, and for us to lead fully communicable lives. The current
              high rate of petrol taxation means that everyone suffers. Petrol
              tax is a very tangible tax paid out of the pockets of all people,
              irrespective of their ability to afford it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, certain groups of people are hit
              hardest — farmers, fishermen, those who live and work in rural
              areas who have no other means of transportation but the car,
              industry and business. For many of these people, as was expressed
              in an article in the ‘Belfast Telegraph’ last Friday,</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The current rate of taxation on fuel is
              the difference between breaking even and going under&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the dual reality in Northern Ireland of
              poor rail transportation and inflated fuel costs, surely the
              Assembly has a valid argument in pressing the Chancellor of the
              Exchequer and the Prime Minister to take measures to lessen the
              impact of high fuel costs in the Province. The people’s
              &quot;genuine and sincerely held grievances&quot;, to quote the
              Prime Minister, must now be listened to and acted upon.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although we in Northern Ireland have not held
              protests like those in Great Britain, our grievances and concerns
              are just as great and equally valid, if not more so, than those
              across the water. We must press this point at the highest possible
              level in the Government during the following days and weeks if a
              positive outcome is to be achieved.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are wider issues to be addressed. I thank
              Mr&nbsp;Beggs and Mr&nbsp;Dodds for highlighting these in the
              motion. We need to try to stamp out illegal smuggling of fuel
              across national borders, something that we can identify with in
              Northern Ireland. It would also be encouraging to see a fairer and
              more uniform petrol tax level throughout the European Union than
              currently exists. Then we might not see a repeat of the scenes
              that occurred in Great Britain and other European countries last
              week. Members of the House can and ought to combine our influence
              over these matters for the good of all the people of Northern
              Ireland. We want to see fairer fuel prices for ourselves as part
              of the United Kingdom and fairer fuel prices for the United
              Kingdom as part of the European Union. It is with this hope that I
              support the motion and ask others to do likewise.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. I speak as a
              representative of a border constituency. Border areas have been
              feeling the negative effects of the British Government’s tax on
              fuel for a number of years. For at least the past three years the
              signs have been visible of the damage that is being done to local
              economies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are aware of the debate that has been going
              on at European level for many years now about the particular
              problems of border areas and the need for measures to help such
              areas overcome peripherality and isolation. The British and Irish
              Governments, as well as many other Governments in the European
              Union, are committed to supporting the development of integrated
              and sustainable border communities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The submission for Northern Ireland structural
              funds and the submission from the South, part of the national
              development plan, both contained a common chapter, which set out
              the importance of co-operation between the two Governments as well
              as co-operation at local level for the benefit of those areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current wide differences that we have heard
              about so much here today in fuel taxes between the two Governments
              are undermining the commitments which the Governments have given
              at European level. This problem has been going on for
              three&nbsp;years in my county of Fermanagh. Forecourts are empty;
              almost all the small filling stations have now closed; most road
              hauliers have moved their businesses south into the Republic of
              Ireland; and more people have become unemployed as a result and
              that in an area like Fermanagh where traditionally there have been
              high levels of unemployment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to refer to comments made earlier by
              Mr&nbsp;McCartney, the Member for North Down, about the high
              levels of smuggling and racketeering in south Armagh and
              Fermanagh. The smuggling of fuel, or anything else for that
              matter, and racketeering are not a serious issue in Fermanagh.
              Whether it is happening at all, I cannot say.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The very serious issue in Fermanagh is, as I
              have said, the drift across the border and the effects that that
              is having on the wider economy, and not least on agriculture.
              There is much dependence on agriculture in the border areas and,
              as references have been made to fuel prices, I want to point out
              that the fuel used for agricultural purposes, the red diesel, is
              now costing farmers 25&nbsp;pence per litre. Over the last
              12&nbsp;months the increase on that fuel alone has been 150%, and
              that has happened at a time when farmers have been trying to cope
              with the problems and the difficulties that have arisen as a
              result of the BSE crisis.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This problem with fuel has been brought to the
              attention of the Governments in various countries. I just want to
              refer to a deputation of which I was part of, together with the MP
              for South Down, Mr&nbsp;Eddie&nbsp;McGrady, that went to the
              Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1999. We detailed to the Chancellor
              the problems at that time, and we asked for Government
              intervention. My council in Fermanagh regards this as a priority
              issue and has raised it with the present Secretary of State, but
              until now the Government have refused to help.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that when today’s debate is finished
              they will take on board the serious situation that now exists for
              everybody in this community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The common chapter that I referred to
              identified the common challenges facing the economies in both
              parts of Ireland. The solution to this fuel crisis requires a
              review of the British Government’s policy on fuel taxes in
              Northern Ireland. Is there a precedent for that? The Chancellor’s
              recent initiative offered tax incentives to small and medium-sized
              enterprises. Some of these tax incentives are of the order of
              100%, and that measure shows that it is possible to achieve
              modifications in the existing tax regime.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nothing is impossible with regard to finding a
              solution to this problem. I call on the Government to act now so
              that the discrepancies in fuel taxes between Northern Ireland and
              the Republic of Ireland are addressed. It will be in everyone’s
              interest — especially those living on the northern side of the
              border and along the border corridor.</p>

              that needed to be said has been said. However, I am delighted that
              the motion has cross-party support. Every section of the community
              has been affected by this issue. They continue to be affected by
              it, and they will be affected until it is resolved. Farmers,
              hauliers, petrol station owners and ordinary people who depend on
              fuel for heating and travel are affected. I hope that the people
              who can make a difference, namely the Prime Minister and the
              Chancellor of the Exchequer, will listen to the united voice of
              the Assembly. I also appeal to the Northern Ireland MPs to
              exercise their voice in Westminster and to try and get action to
              be taken so that this situation can be redressed sooner rather
              than later.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a very timely debate and I thank the
              Members who brought it forward. We have to understand how we
              arrived at this situation. The policy of this Government and the
              previous Government was to introduce a fuel escalator. The
              escalator was allegedly to encourage less people to use private
              transport and more people to use public transport. Mr McGrady
              indicated that it was the Conservative Government who introduced
              the escalator, but unfortunately the Labour Government decided to
              carry it on even though other European governments who had been
              using it saw that they had reached their peak and called it a day.
              Those governments, very wisely, stopped using the fuel escalator
              while the British Government continued to use it to raise the
              price of fuel.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, the Labour Government did not go
              forward with a two-pronged attack and also try to bring about
              greater use of the public transport system. Mr Prescott, after
              being in office for three years, has only recently brought out a
              document addressing the problems in public transport. Yet, we have
              had three years of the hiking-up of fuel prices.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the past five years, the number of cars on
              Northern Ireland’s roads has increased by 21% — approximately
              125,000. Therefore, the fuel escalator, without also addressing
              the needs of public transport, does not work. The environmental
              reasons given for the fuel escalator were exposed last week as a
              great myth, and in the middle of the crisis Mr Blair said that the
              price of fuel could not be cut because the money was needed for
              the Health Service and the education service. That is true. It is
              not what the Government have been saying in previous budgets but
              it is a fact of life. Around £40 billion per year is used as a
              stealth tax — a tax that no one can see. People go to the petrol
              pump and the petrol pump acts as a tax collector.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That &quot;stealth&quot; tax is taken from the
              community, and it is not put back into transport, it is not put
              into roads, it is not put into railways or airports. It is put
              into other services, so that they can tinker about with tax at the
              other end of the regime and go to the electorate at the next
              election and say we have cut the rate of income tax by 2%, 3% or
              whatever. The fact is that they are taking more tax than ever.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland, the Exchequer has lost
              millions of pounds. It is estimated that three-quarters of a
              billion litres of petrol and diesel are now imported to Northern
              Ireland. No tax is paid on that. Three-quarters of a billion
              litres equates to about £460&nbsp;million lost to the economy.
              Furthermore, the service stations that would have been selling
              that fuel lose about £40&nbsp;million that they would have made
              from it. On top of that, the services that they would have
              provided and the other goods that they would have sold are also
              lost to the British tax economy. That has resulted in a net loss
              to the economy in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also a loss to the economy in the
              United Kingdom as a whole. Lorry drivers all fill up their
              vehicles when they are in Belgium, Holland or France. They do not
              wait until they get back to the United Kingdom to fill up their
              lorries. They are allowed to carry 300&nbsp;gallons of fuel in
              their tanks. As soon as they get close to the ferry port they fill
              up their tanks with diesel. Then they come over to the United
              Kingdom, do what they have to do and go back to the continent with
              their next load. Inevitably, they will fill up on the continent
              again. That means less tax coming into the British economy. The
              statistical evidence is that diesel revenue has actually been
              reduced as a result of high fuel prices in the United Kingdom.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The high fuel prices that the haulage companies
              are paying impact upon ordinary consumers: you, me and the people
              that we represent. The higher the cost of fuel to the haulage
              companies, the higher the costs that they will pass on to their
              customers. Their customers are the Safeways, the Tescos and the
              large shops in our community. They have to add that into the price
              of their goods, and ultimately the consumer has to pay more,
              whether it be in food, in clothing or whatever. They have to pay
              more as a result of the high fuel costs. The consumer is not only
              losing out in terms of driving, but in every other respect as
              well.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a number of ways in which this could
              be tackled. There could be an overall reduction in the price of
              fuel. A Member said earlier that if the Government reduced the
              price of fuel by 8p per litre, it would not affect the Chancellor’s
              public sector projections, because he had expected to gain an
              extra £4&nbsp;billion in revenue from North Sea oil.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other way would be to make the tax
              rebatable to VAT-registered companies, particularly haulage
              companies, because the haulage people are the ones who are
              suffering the most. We already have a regime wherein VAT can be
              reclaimed by the haulage companies and by legitimate businesses.
              Why can we not have a rebate on fuel costs to VAT-registered
              businesses? That would reduce costs for the haulage companies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is considered that some 85,000 people in the
              United Kingdom who were involved in haulage lost their jobs as a
              result of high fuel costs. That needs to be tackled. It cannot be
              left any longer. Mr&nbsp;Blair has been given 55&nbsp;days to
              address it by the protestors in the United Kingdom, and it was
              clear that public opinion was with the protestors, not with the
              Government. They had lost touch with the people on this particular
              issue. Mr&nbsp;Blair needs to address this issue and bring fuel
              costs in the United Kingdom down to an acceptable level within the
              European Union. We are in a community where we are supposed to
              compete with the other countries on a fair basis, but it is
              difficult to compete on a fair basis whenever such a vital
              commodity has such an exorbitant price in comparison to the other
              member states.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fuel is essential in Northern Ireland, both for
              the agriculturr community and for ordinary consumers. High fuel
              costs have a greater impact on Northern Ireland, because we burn
              oil in our power stations and over 50% of houses use oil-fired
              central heating. I understand that the current price of home
              heating oil is not due to the tax regime implemented by
              Gordon&nbsp;Brown — it is due to the high oil prices set by OPEC
              — but the Government could be doing more.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have been imposing sanctions against Iraq
              for 10&nbsp;years. It has been interesting to see those sanctions
              implemented. The forces that went in to deal with
              Saddam&nbsp;Hussein at that time did not finish the job. They have
              decided to punish the whole community in Iraq because of their
              leader. That has lead to the deaths of some 20,000 children
              through shortages of medicine and food.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government should be saying to the
              President of the United States, in particular, that it is time to
              review that situation. We should supply Iraq with more medical
              supplies, ensure that they have enough food to feed their children
              and, at the same time, allow them to sell more oil. There is an
              oil deficit throughout the world. That particular country has a
              food and medicine deficit. We should not starve the children of
              that country because they have an evil and wicked leader. The
              Prime Minister should be looking at that. That could significantly
              reduce the price of fuel. Our pensioners have to pay for home
              heating oil and our electricity companies have to pay to generate
              electricity. That is another thing that I would like to see the
              Government looking at.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this debate. It has been useful, and
              I hope that Westminster sits up and takes notice, not only of what
              the people in England, Scotland and Wales are saying, but also of
              what this Assembly, which represents the people of Northern
              Ireland, is saying.</p>

              put forward by my own party and by the DUP. There has not been a

              behind this.</p>

              repeating themselves time and again. I concur with what a number
              of people have said. There was a demonstration outside today by
              farmers and hauliers. It was brought home to me that we are going
              to have a late harvest. All the grain is going to have to be dried
              and there is only one way of doing that: by using oil. The cost of
              diesel is three times what it was last year. All the costs have
              doubled. Farmers have all that to pay, yet in the past two years
              their incomes have decreased by 17% to 20%. How can we expect
              people to keep their businesses running in a situation like that?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland depends very much on help from
              outside, for tourism example. The bed and breakfast and hotel
              industries depend on oil. They need all they encouragement they
              can get, instead of obstacles being put in their way. Obstacles
              have been put in their way through no fault of their own. These
              industries cannot create progress and prosperity when costs and
              overheads are driving them down. All these expenses have got to be
              clawed back from the people who come into this country: tourists.
              The price of home heating oil affects homes for the elderly. That
              has to be taken on board.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is something that has to be taken on
              board. We are coming into winter and we have to make preparations
              to help the elderly. A lot of talk today was about the fuel
              escalator — that is all very well. But what long-term effects
              will this have on the economy of an already crippled
              industrialised business fraternity — a business fraternity that
              has suffered over the years because of the troubles? And just when
              we thought that things were about to move forward, we find
              ourselves again at a standstill.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that everybody in this Chamber will
              throw their weight completely behind this motion, but we have to
              take this further. I hope the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of
              the Exchequer take on board the seriousness of the situation,
              because if something is not done, the whole place will gradually
              come to a standstill. There are many areas that need an injection
              of finance. The crisis that is about to hit this country is
              unbelievable. I hope that the Government take heed of today’s
              protest by farmers and hauliers who are facing doom and gloom all
              the time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has been a worthwhile exercise by all
              involved and I only hope that the Government take heed.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that the motion was tabled with
              every good intention, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to
              support it. But I fear that given the publicity that will follow
              this debate and all the figures that we have heard, even more
              hauliers, agriculture contractors and businesses that depend on
              fuel will go south for their supplies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I checked one item this morning that allows me
              to give an up-to-date report on the scale of the problem. A litre
              of diesel north of the border is retailing at 87p, while a litre
              of the same fuel on the southern side is available at 65p, which,
              when converted, is 52p sterling — a difference of 35p per litre.
              Mr Dodds referred this morning to how talking of litres gives us a
              less serious view of the problem. The figures I have just quoted,
              when converted to gallons, demonstrate a price differential
              between North and South of £1.59 per gallon. One could be
              forgiven for thinking that £1.59 was the price of a gallon of
              diesel, but it is not. It is the difference between the price of a
              gallon of white diesel bought at the pumps in the South and one
              bought at a service station in the North. Please forgive me for
              repeating the price differential — £1.59 per gallon.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week hauliers and farmers in the Republic
              served notice on their Government that they are not going to
              tolerate what they view as an unacceptable fuel tax and, in world
              terms, greatly inflated fuel prices. I can only imagine what the
              additional repercussions here will be if the Taoiseach, Tánaiste
              and Minister McCreevy deal with their fuel crisis by reducing the
              prices in their jurisdiction.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join the call from the Assembly for an
              immediate reduction of our over inflated fuel prices,
              responsibility for which rests firmly with the Prime Minister and
              the Chancellor and their fuel taxes. If this does not happen, our
              hauliers, our fishing industry, our agriculture and horticulture
              will just move day by day into a financial wilderness, from which
              they will never emerge. I welcome the debate and I support the
              motion. May I say to Mr Poots that the Government have
              56&nbsp;days, and counting down, to get their act together.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call the First Minister to respond on behalf
              of the Executive.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
              </i><b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Mr Trimble):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We considered it appropriate that in this
              debate, something should be said on behalf of the Administration.
              We do not have responsibility for taxation matters, but we do have
              a responsibility for relationships with other institutions. I want
              to apologise to the Assembly. Because of other business I was
              unable to attend the debate this morning, but I have listened to
              the debate this afternoon.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an important matter, and that
              importance has been underlined by the comments that Members have
              made. Last week we saw significant public protests across the
              water that had a significant impact on the supply of fuel. Similar
              problems did not arise in Northern Ireland. If they had, then a
              crisis management group, chaired by the head of the Civil Service,
              would have been activated by Ministers. It would have included all
              the permanent secretaries and would have reported to the
              Executive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The crisis management group, and others, would
              have had to consider such matters as the deployment of Government
              staff and property, the allocation of responsibility for taking
              action — whether it be gaps, overlaps or uncertainties; the
              co-ordination of difficulties between organisations; public
              information issues; financial aspects of the response; the
              provision of immediate funding to meet special needs; the approval
              of emergency expenditure and the need for long-term funding for
              restoration and risk litigation. Had a crisis arisen, the nature
              of that crisis would have been somewhat different here in Northern
              Ireland compared to the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important, in this context, to bear in
              mind that power supplies would not have been affected in the same
              way. Electricity generation here is dependent mainly on natural
              gas and coal. Coolkeeragh, the only power station running on oil,
              receives its supplies by ship, not by road. Obviously if
              difficulties had arisen in other means of transport, that would
              have had a progressive effect on industry here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consequently, we want to welcome the
              responsible approach that was taken by hauliers and farmers here.
              I assure them, and the community as a whole, that we do not
              underestimate the strength of opinion on this issue. Indeed, we
              were aware of the extent of the problem, and we have, over some
              time, been making representations to the Government about it. Last
              December, at the inaugural meeting of the British/Irish
              Intergovernmental Council, we made representations to both the
              British and Irish Prime Ministers. In addition, we have made
              representations to the Treasury, and there have been meetings at
              ministerial level on this issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Representations have been made with regard to
              the overall level of the fuel duty, which is too high in absolute
              terms, and the differential between North and South, which people
              have mentioned in this debate, is a considerable problem and we
              have also explored other possibilities, in particular, the way in
              which other assistance may be given to industry. The difficulty
              here is with regard to European community requirements on state
              aids and regional aids. We have been trying to explore these
              issues with the Government and will continue to do so. The
              unanimity in today’s debate, right across the political
              spectrum, can only enhance the weight of the representations that
              we have made and will continue to make.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It remains to be seen whether the Chancellor
              will respond by altering fuel duties in the next Budget, or
              whether he will offer some other compensation to hauliers and
              motorists through rebates, motor tax or licence fees.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note the report in the press this morning,
              specifically in ‘The&nbsp;Times’, suggesting that the
              Chancellor is not minded to cut fuel tax. It is said that he is
              considering extending the fuel rebate scheme, used by the bus
              industry, to road hauliers as well as offering further discounts
              in vehicle excise duties. No matter what is done there, we will
              press for similar measures in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The position here is further complicated by
              evidence pointing to a high degree of cross-border fuel smuggling.
              That has put severe financial pressures on petrol retailers,
              particularly in border areas, and a considerable number of them
              who refused to deal in illicit fuel have closed down. We have met
              relevant Ministers on a number of occasions to press for measures
              to be taken to deal with this matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because the Deputy First Minister and I were in
              the United States last week, we were unable to meet the
              representatives of the fuel crisis group. I am happy to say that
              our junior Ministers, Dennis Haughey and Dermot Nesbitt, did meet
              the group and discuss matters with them. We are very grateful to
              the group for the responsible attitude they and others adopted,
              and, consequently, for the absence of any major disruption to fuel
              supplies in Northern Ireland. We understand the difficulties faced
              by many industries, and we will continue to monitor the situation,
              make representations where we can and look at the implications for
              local industry.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Home Secretary stated in interviews today
              that legislation will be introduced to put oil companies on the
              same basis as other utilities such as gas and electricity with
              regard to the continuity of supply, but he ruled out any immediate
              recourse to emergency legislation. Exactly the same emergency
              legislation is on the statute book in Northern Ireland, should it
              be needed to deal with these matters. If further legislation is
              introduced in England and Wales with regard to the regulation of
              utilities, we will consider whether there are any implications for
              us in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the apparently unanimous cross-party
              support for this motion. Some of that support came from surprising
              quarters, but I welcome it nevertheless. Many additional valid
              points were made by Members during the course of the debate, and
              while I do not need to respond to these, I would like to comment
              on some matters.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those of you who are aware of the Newry and
              Mourne Hydrocarbons Traffic Order 1990 will know that it was
              introduced specifically to end fuel smuggling by Republicans in
              the Larkin Road area in south Armagh. If there has been a
              transformation by Republicans on the smuggling issue, I would
              welcome it; however, I will believe it when they and other
              paramilitary groups end smuggling and support the customs and
              excise officers and the RUC in enforcing the law.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who suggest that an all-Ireland economy
              would be a wonderful panacea should also bear in mind that this
              would mean a rise of 10% in our income tax and medical costs every
              time a person visited the doctor. Such a course of action,
              however, would not take account of the heritage and the political
              wishes of the greater number of people of Northern Ireland who
              wish to remain in the United Kingdom.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also want to express my surprise at the lack
              of responsibility indicated by comments from SDLP Members.
              Balanced prices either side of the border would be required to end
              smuggling. It would be likely that these would be obtained by
              reducing fuel duty in Northern Ireland and increasing it in the
              Republic of Ireland, as has been suggested by my Colleague, Esmond
              Birnie. Instead, however, the SDLP talked about a vague concept of
              harmonisation, without acknowledging that the only way of
              achieving that would be for the citizens of the Irish Republic to
              endure some pain.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to thank all Members who have
              spoken in support of the motion. This issue is likely to remain on
              both the short-term and long-term political agendas until fuel
              pricing disparity has been removed and the potential for
              profiteering by smugglers across the border comes to an end. I
              would like to assure this House and the various interest groups,
              who have held such a dignified and effective protest today, that
              it is my intention to continue to press this issue, both in the
              Assembly, where relevant, and in other Houses. I expect our
              Members of Parliament for Northern Ireland to continue to seek the
              adoption of the many worthwhile proposals which were made on this
              issue in the recent Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee
              report and to press that with central Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was a thorough report and some worthwhile
              comments were made. It can now be taken forward at Westminster.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the First Minister for his response on
              behalf of the Executive, which illustrates that he appears to be
              well briefed on the matter. I urge Members to support the motion.</p>
