	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  At the start of the sitting on Tuesday 20 November, Mr Storey sought a ruling  on the issue of a Deputy Speaker having voted on a motion after being in the  Chair for part of the debate on that motion. I agreed to come back to the House  with a ruling on that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the case to which Mr Storey referred, I have established  that the Deputy Speaker was in the Chair for three minutes, or slightly less.  In that time he gave advice to the House on a petition of concern and on the  time that had been allocated to the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Deputy Speaker heard only a very small portion of the  opening speech in the debate, and was not required to intervene during that  time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Deputy Speaker was in the Chair for that short time  through no fault of his own. He was due to leave the Chair before the debate  commenced. There was an unfortunate delay in my arrival to relieve him, and the  Deputy Speaker, quite rightly, continued with business when the previous item  on the Order Paper had concluded.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In this instance, the Deputy Speaker&rsquo;s voting &mdash; or not  voting &mdash; would not have altered the overall result.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, our convention has been that Deputy Speakers  do not participate in debates during which they have occupied the Chair. That  is clear from page 13 of &lsquo;The Assembly Companion&rsquo; and, in my view, voting on a  motion or an amendment clearly qualifies as participation in a debate. With  hindsight &mdash; despite the very brief time that the Deputy Speaker spent in the  Chair &mdash; I should have advised Deputy Speakers not to involve themselves in a  vote at the conclusion of a debate during which they have been in the Chair.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">I shall ensure that, in  future, that convention is adhered</span> to, and I thank Mr Storey for this  example of what I <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">described last week as a  valid and helpful point of order.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have made my ruling, and the matter is closed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I hear what you have said, and I draw your  attention to Standing Order 25(2). I understand that not only did the Deputy  Speaker preside and vote but had signed the petition of concern that had been  presented on the motion that was being debated.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I thank Lord Morrow for that helpful <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">point  of order. I can assure him that it is has been noted.</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker. Will you accept  that it is entirely inappropriate for a Deputy Speaker of this House to sign a  petition of concern and then to sit in the Chair, albeit for a brief period, during the debate on the motion on which  he has signed a petition of concern? Will you rule that that is  inappropriate and should not happen in the future?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I thank the Member for his point of order. I  have ruled that no Deputy Speaker who has been in the Chair during a  debate should be involved in the voting on that motion. I am absolutely clear  on that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  On a further point of order, Mr Speaker. Will you also make a ruling on the  issue of the validity of the petition of concern? If the Deputy Speaker had  signed the petition of concern and had given advice regarding it when in the  Chair, surely the petition of concern is brought into question and rather than  having the required 30 signatures would have only 29?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  My advice is absolutely clear: the petition of concern was valid &mdash; very much  so.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  On a further point of order, Mr Speaker. The Deputy Speaker to whom you refer  seems to court some controversy. I ask the Speaker to rule on allegations that  have been made in the House of Commons about a story in regard &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I ask the Member to take his seat. I advise him not to stray into that  particular area. He should not do that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Will you  advise the House on what should happen in future? Clearly, the Deputy  Speaker was in a situation that was unprecedented and unintended. Following  your ruling today, in future, should the Deputy Speaker suspend the sitting  until someone else can take the Chair or is he trapped in a situation that was  not planned?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That situation will not arise again. I can assure the Member of that.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council &mdash; &nbsp;Tourism Sectoral Meeting</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment that he  wishes to make a statement regarding the North/South Ministerial Council  tourism sectoral meeting.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mr Dodds)</strong>: In compliance with section 52 of the  Northern Ireland Act 1998, I wish to make the following report on the first  North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meeting in tourism sectoral format since the restoration of the Executive and the  Assembly. The report has been endorsed by Michelle Gildernew. The  meeting was held in Dublin   Castle on 8 November  2007. I represented the Northern Ireland Executive as Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment along with Michelle Gildernew, Minister of Agriculture and  Rural Development. The Irish Government were represented by S&eacute;amus Brennan,  Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council considered a report from Ms Ann Riordan,  vice-chair of Tourism Ireland  and welcomed the progress that that organisation has made since the last  meeting in February 2002. The Council noted the strong growth in visitor  numbers and revenue, which are forecast to have grown by 2&middot;17 million and &pound;0&middot;87  billion respectively during that period, including an increase of 391,000 in the  number of visitors to Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council received a presentation on the future plans of  Tourism Ireland  from the chief executive officer. It welcomed the broad objectives outlined in  Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s three-year  corporate plan, including the two key goals of increasing tourism to the island of Ireland  as a whole and supporting Northern    Ireland to realise its tourism potential.  The Council welcomed the corporate plan&rsquo;s challenging targets and approved, in  principle, the Tourism Ireland corporate plan 2008-10 and the business plan for  2008, subject to budgetary considerations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council also noted Tourism Ireland Ltd&rsquo;s annual report  and accounts for 2006. The Council agreed that the next meeting of the  North/South Ministerial Council in tourism sectoral format should take place in  spring 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (Mr Durkan)</strong>: I thank the Minister for his statement  and I thank him and his ministerial colleagues for their work at the sectoral  meeting.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some time ago, the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment had the  benefit of a presentation from Tourism Ireland Ltd as well as those from other  key interests. It is welcome to see a positive perspective on the success of  Tourism Ireland Ltd in contributing to a growth in visitor numbers in the  island as a whole, and in the North as well.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Tourism Ireland Ltd  takes forward that marketing responsibility, will the Minister, through  the Council and his own office, take steps to ensure that Tourism Ireland Ltd  is in a better position to engage with the <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">regional  tourism partnerships (RTPs) that are performing</span> tourism functions and  trying to market local areas? RTPs have been complaining to Committee members that they do not have the positive and active  relationship with Tourism Ireland Ltd that would allow them to make the  most of their marketing role.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: I thank the Committee Chairperson for his remarks, and I  assure him that as far as I am concerned the potential for tourism to  contribute greatly to the economy of Northern Ireland  is well recognised. We have an enormous opportunity to avail of that  contribution as we move forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson will be aware that the work of the various  parts of the tourism industry was examined recently by the Northern Ireland  Affairs Committee, which looked at the relationships between Tourism Ireland  Ltd, the RTPs, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board  (NITB) and all of the stakeholders in promoting tourism. It is something  that I am looking at very carefully.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a distinction in marketing responsibilities  between Tourism Ireland Ltd, which is responsible for marketing in GB and elsewhere, and the Northern Ireland Tourist  Board, which is responsible for marketing in the  Irish Republic  and Northern Ireland  and for product development. It is important that the RTPs are fully and  properly engaged as appropriate with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and  Tourism Ireland Ltd, and they can be assured of my support in that regard.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the annual demonstrations and other events  organised by the Loyal Orders offer a unique opportunity to enhance Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  tourism potential, and would he give an indication of his plans to realise that  potential?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>:  Cultural tourism is a major part of the tourism product that most countries and  regions offer. In Northern    Ireland, particularly, that is something  that we can exploit better as we move forward. All studies show that cultural tourism  is a major motivator when it comes to travel. Sightseers and culture seekers  account for 60% of visitors to the island   of Ireland, and those  numbers are growing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will be aware that the Northern Ireland Tourist  Board has engaged with some of the Loyal Orders on the creation and promotion  of Orangefest, and there is a lot of good work ongoing in relation to that. The  Member will also be aware of a recent press release  issued by the Orange Order in which it was very positive about its engagement with the Northern Ireland Tourist  Board and Tourism Ireland Ltd in this matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is enormous potential for exploiting greater tourism  promise in what is a unique series of events in Northern Ireland, and I will work  closely with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Tourism Ireland Ltd to  realise that potential.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is all very well to talk about increasing the number of  visitors, but did any discussion take place on the accommodation  infrastructure? I refer to rural accommodation, and especially to hostels and  low-budget accommodation. Does the Minister agree that the farming community  needs to diversify? If the matter was not discussed at the sectoral meeting,  will the Minister table it for inclusion in the spring?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: If  the Member reads the corporate plans and  the other documents that were tabled for discussion at the North/South  Ministerial Council tourism sectoral meeting, he will realise that they covered  a vast range of issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland must do more. It must offer more  tourism product, make the best of the skills available in the tourism industry  and improve accommodation at all levels, and that includes improving hotel and  hostel accommodation. My Department is not the only one responsible for  improving the tourism industry &mdash; other Departments are also involved. However,  we must make progress, because if we are to market Northern Ireland better, and bring  more out-of-state visitors to the Province as a result, accommodation is needed  in which to put them up.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to note that progress has been made. Several  rural areas are providing high-quality accommodation, not least County Fermanagh,  which has a new golf hotel. Other parts of the Province are also making  improvements. I will watch carefully to ensure  that the accommodation infrastructure continues to improve and that we  provide our visitors with the requisite standard of accommodation and number of  bed places to meet the growing demand.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: Has  the Minister any plans to attempt to combine all the industry players&rsquo;  strategies when establishing the subregional tourism bodies?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: I  refer the Member to the answer that I gave a  short time ago to the Chairman of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, in which I  dealt with precisely that matter. In my reply, I mentioned the Northern Ireland  Affairs Committee&rsquo;s report, in which it  considered that issue. My Department is also con&shy;sidering it. Greater  clarity of roles and responsibilities among Tourism Ireland, the Northern Ireland  Tourist Board and the regional tourism  partnerships is necessary, and that will be addressed in the coming  months as part of a wider review of departmental tourism-support organisations&rsquo;  roles and responsibilities.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Minister mentioned the increase in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s tourist numbers  and tourist revenue. In order to compare tourism as a percentage share of the  economy in Northern Ireland  with that in the Republic of Ireland, can he indicate what those increases  have been overall? There has been a significant gap between the two countries&rsquo;  levels of development over the years, and the House would be interested to  learn whether that gap is closing or widening. Moreover, how can we take steps  to rebalance tourism on the island   of Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: I  thank the Member for his question, which is an important one. I refer the  Member to the corporate plan for Tourism Ireland and to the accounts that  contain the figures about which he enquired. As I have already said, those  documents formed part of the discussions at the North/South Ministerial Council  tourism sectoral meeting. He is absolutely  right to point to the need to increase Northern   Ireland&rsquo;s percentage share of tourism revenue and visitor  numbers for the island   of Ireland. I am keen to  ensure that that happens, because it is vital that we exploit our tourism  potential.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We hope to have more up-to-date figures shortly, but the  Member will be interested to note that a study that was conducted in 2003 into the value of the tourism industry  to the Northern Ireland economy, and from which the most up-to-date figures  come, found that the total income generated by tourism in that year was worth  some 3&middot;5% of gross value added (GVA) &mdash; &pound;782 million &mdash; to the Northern Ireland economy. That study was one of the  first of its kind into tourism and its contribution to the economy to be  carried out anywhere in the United    Kingdom and means that tourism activity  supports some 36,700 jobs. Therefore, tourism makes a significant contribution  to our economy. In fact, our tourism industry contributes four fifths of what  our agriculture industry does to GVA.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is an important contribution to the economy, but the Member is absolutely right to point to the  unfulfilled potential and the need to close the gap with the Irish Republic.  The targets that we have set out in the Programme for Government for increases  in visitor numbers and revenue are  challenging and different from what has gone before. Under direct rule,  we would not have had that kind of focus on the economic benefits of tourism.  Those challenging figures have been put there for a reason: because they can  give a major, quick return to the economy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Can the Minister confirm that the Tourism Ireland brand review was discussed at  the sectoral meeting? Can he give us an update on the progress of that review  and on what its conclusions are likely to be?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>:  The current brand has been in place since 1995, and refinements to it have been  made on two occasions. A major exercise has been under way to look at the brand  and reflect the changing nature of life in both Northern   Ireland and the Irish Republic.  It is important that the brand image that goes out across the world is appropriate  to today&rsquo;s circumstances. Tourism Ireland is finalising its report on  the review, which will be launched to the tourism industry soon. Tourism  Ireland will be launching a new marketing campaign to communicate the new brand  message in 2009 and, in preparation for that, will be working with the industry  in Northern Ireland and in the Irish Republic through&shy;out next year to ensure full understanding of, and buy-in to, the  brand and to develop industry&rsquo;s awareness of its critical role in developing  and delivering that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. My colleague Mr Clarke raised the issue of the lack of  accommodation and the need to provide more. One of the tourist places in the  north-west that is most famous in song and story is Portstewart. One by one,  the hotels there have been demolished and replaced with apartments. The place  has become an ugly dormitory for the university in Coleraine. Maybe we could  move along the coast and look at what is probably the most beautiful part of  the north-west and maybe the most beautiful part of Ireland:  the Magilligan coast from Downhill to Derry  city, with all the possibilities for activity tourism on the beach and on the water. I have made  representations to our Southern counterparts, and they would &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Do I detect a question?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>: Will the Minister raise the whole issue of the north-west with his Southern counterpart when  they meet again, and see what can be done to develop what is a place of  great potential, for tourism and otherwise?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>:  The Member may be reassured to know that I do not have to wait for the next  meeting with my Southern counterparts to deal with that issue. We are  addressing it already, and will continue to do so. He mentioned the issue of  accommodation, which has also been raised previously. It is, as I have said, a  matter that we are very conscious of. It will obviously involve a major  contribution from the private sector. I know that some Members have a problem  with that, but if we are to see the accommodation issue moving forward, the  private sector will have to become more active in that whole area, in terms of  both the provision of accommodation and the quality of the experience that is  offered to people who stay.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will be aware of the Walled City  signature project in the north-west; it has received a lot of support, and has  progressed very well. It is already making an impact on tourist numbers for the  city of Londonderry.  Major work has also been done in the Causeway   Coast area as part of the  signature project programme. The outlook for tourism in the north-west, and in  the north of the Province generally, is extremely positive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is one of our major attractions, and the input of  funding and resources will increase that. With regard to accommodation, anyone  in the private sector who looks ahead at economic growth will realise that  there are enormous opportunities in Northern Ireland, given the  expected increase in visitor numbers. The Minister of the Environment, who has responsibility for planning, is  present, and I have no doubt that she has heard all that has been said. I hope  that cognisance will be taken of the  necessary balance between investment for tourist growth and the issues raised concerning planning while  preserving the heritage.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement, in which tourism was specifically  mentioned. I love taking a tour of the Irish coast, along Strangford Lough, to  Killynether forest, or to Mount   Stewart. Will the  Minister elaborate on how he sees tourism in Northern Ireland providing the  potential jobs and the economic boost for us all?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>:  Several Members have waxed lyrical about the beauty of their own areas, and  that is to be commended. I well remember an  excellent Adjournment Debate on the beauties of Strangford: it saved the  Northern Ireland Tourist Board from having to write its next brochure on that  part of the world.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Shannon, who is a Member for Strangford, mentioned potential. In response to Dr Farry, a  Member for North Down, I spoke of the current economic contribution. At  the onset of the Troubles more than 35 years ago, Northern Ireland lost 80% of its  tourism overnight, and has never really recovered from that. A gap exists  between those who visit the South and those who come here because of the legacy  issues. When that gap is considered, there is enormous potential.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A country of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  size and economy warrants more than the 5% to 7% of resident holiday visitors  and approximately 50% of the business visitors from Great Britain  who come here. Moreover, there are enormous  opportunities to increase not only the number of visitors from Great    Britain, but from the Republic. Had Northern Ireland matched, since 1969, the Republic of Ireland&rsquo;s external-visitor trends, the  income from tourism would have been worth an additional &pound;0&middot;25 billion. That  shows the potential, and the enormous contribution that could be made to job  creation in all parts of Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement, and  I suppose that, when Members are lauding their own areas, he will agree  with me about County   Fermanagh and its  potential. I am curious to know whether there was any discussion about plans or  proposals to develop the Republic of Ireland site of the Battle  of the Boyne. That would increase tourist  potential in that area.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>:  The Member is right to point to the beauties of Fermanagh. He shares a position  with me on that, since I was brought up there, and my parents still live there.  I take delight in agreeing with him on that point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It does not require a meeting of the North/South  Ministerial Council for my Department to progress the matter of the Boyne heritage site and to be interested in discussing  it. Many have pointed to its potential tourist growth and, to be fair, the Irish  Government have been positive in their contribution. The Member can, therefore,  be assured that on that issue &mdash; as on the beauties of Fermanagh &mdash; he and I are  at one.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I, too, welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. With regard to Mr  Simpson&rsquo;s question on the role of the Orange Order, I have no doubt that, now  that it has sent best wishes to the new Cardinal, there will be inquisitive  visitors from all over the world.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that Tourism Ireland, with a base  in Coleraine, is ideally suited to ensuring that Northern Ireland gets its fair  share of international tourism?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister ensure the House that the develop&shy;ment of  the lower River Bann and the reopening of the Ulster Canal remain at the top of the agenda in promoting  international tourism?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>:  The Member &mdash; quite rightly &mdash; raises the matter of the Ulster Canal,  part of which is in his constituency. That issue primarily falls within the  remit of the Department of Culture, Arts and  Leisure (DCAL), and I am sure that that Department will note the  Member&rsquo;s comments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is talking about a tourism product for Northern    Ireland. We have an ambitious and challenging target to increase the  number of visitors to Northern    Ireland to 2&middot;5 million over the period of  the next comprehensive spending review (CSR) to 2011. That means investing not  only in marketing &mdash; which is Tourism Ireland Ltd&rsquo;s job &mdash; but in product.  Signature projects are important for economic growth, as is local tourism. I  want to support all types of tourism product and see them grow. Northern Ireland  has a natural beauty and landscape, but we must prioritise the creation of  better-quality activities and the provision of more accommodation.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s briefing on  the North/South Ministerial Council&rsquo;s tourism sectoral meeting. I wish to  revisit an issue that was discussed in the  House yesterday, but I am conscious of the Speaker&rsquo;s advice about how  far the matter can be pushed. Given the crossover in membership of the events  company and the Tourist Board, is the Minister confident that the Tourist Board  is in safe hands?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:4.25pt;"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: Given that the Tourist Board falls under the remit of my  Department, I can give the Member a categorical assurance that it is in safe  hands; I hope that he agrees with me.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">As the Member said, the Northern  Ireland Events Company, which is a matter for the Department of Culture, Arts  and Leisure, was discussed in the House yesterday. In principle, it is planned,  after all due diligence has been exercised, that the events company will merge  with the Tourist Board as soon as possible. At this stage, I do not wish to  comment any further, other than to say that I have confidence in the Tourist  Board&rsquo;s management and in the role of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (DETI).</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:4.25pt;"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>: I declare an interest as a member of Lisburn City  Council.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">Will the Minister tell the House  what discussions he has had with his counterpart in the South about the reopening  of the Lagan Canal  in order to develop the Belfast  metropolitan area&rsquo;s tourist potential? The Minister  is a member of Belfast City Council, so he will know that Castlereagh  Borough Council, Belfast City Council, Lisburn City Council and Craigavon  Borough Council have formed a group to progress the reopening of the Lagan Canal.  The canal is an important inland waterway that links into Lough Neagh and ultimately  into the lower River Bann and Ulster Canal  systems.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:4.25pt;"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: The Member has done an excellent, and appropriate, job in  advertising the benefits of that scheme, in which various councils are  participating. I agree with him about the scheme&rsquo;s positive impact and the work  that has been undertaken to date. He will be aware that that issue falls  primarily within the remit of the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, and  I will raise that point with my ministerial colleague.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">My  counterpart in the Irish Republic and I agree that it is absolutely  vital to raise the quality and standard of the tourism product in order to  increase the number of visitors and the  revenue generated in the Irish Republic and in Northern Ireland. The  project that the Member describes is a key element of that. I have no doubt  that, when that project comes to fruition, it will be a big draw and will  enhance Lisburn and Belfast.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:4.25pt;"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>: I thank the Minister for his briefing on the tourism sectoral meeting. I welcome his  comments about cultural tourism and local tourism projects.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does he have any plans  to develop local, community-based tourism projects such as Coiste, which  is a republican ex-prisoner group in west Belfast?  Such projects attract large numbers of visitors each year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: I  refer the Member to my earlier comments about cultural tourism. It is important  that the tourism product contains a mix of projects. I cannot respond in the  House today about the particular project that the Member has mentioned.  However, now that it has been drawn to my attention, I will look at what the  project entails. It is vital that both visitors and local residents are  comfortable with tourism projects, and their product, because local people who  go on day trips generate a great deal of our tourism spend. Any allocation of  funds to projects that receive public money to support them must be done in a  fair, neutral, impartial and balanced way.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  The Minister has touched briefly on my  question. Is he satisfied with the profile given to the Walled City  signature project in Londonderry? Does he  agree that the project has tremendous potential, particularly as we approach  the four-hundredth anniversary of the plantation of Ulster?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>:  The Walled City signature project has enormous  potential. I was recently in Londonderry,  where I visited some elements of the project, the progress on which was very  encouraging.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member mentioned the four-hundredth anniversary of the  plantation of Ulster.  In a recent discussion with a delegation from the local council and the Dean of  Londonderry, I had the opportunity to talk about  the anniversary. How that event should be marked is being planned. It is  an important anniversary, which includes a number of significant events, and  the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and local stakeholders in Londonderry  will want to mark it. For visitors to Northern   Ireland who seek cultural tourism and attractions that  are linked to our history, the plantation of Ulster rates as one of the more  significant events.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: Is the Minister satisfied that the amounts allocated to the  Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Tourism Ireland in the draft Budget will  ensure that targets are met?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: The  Member raises an important matter. In the draft Programme for Government and  the comprehensive spending review, we have  put our money where our mouth is.  Under direct rule, there was a great deal of talk about boosting tourism  and the economy, but the resources, emphasis and centrality required to do that  were not recognised. That is the difference between the draft Programme for  Government and the comprehensive spending review and what went before.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Significant additions  have been made to the resources and  capital given to the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s  resource allocations have also increased significantly. There is a long way yet  to go, however. I could argue a strong case in the House for even more  resources to be provided, but I will instead continue to argue that case in an  appropriate manner, because I recognise that a balance must be struck on all  expenditure issues. The Minister of Finance and Personnel, who is at my side  and will have heard what I said, recognises, as do my colleagues, the  importance of the economy, and the importance of tourism to the economy. I am  confident that the challenging targets that have been set will be achieved. The  increased resources, and the drive behind those resources, will ensure that we achieve  the value for money and delivery that will produce the necessary results.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I declare an interest as a member of Armagh City  and District Council. Being from one of the beautiful parts of the North &mdash; Armagh City,  the ecclesiastical capital &mdash; I am aware that we have the cardinal coming on  Thursday and that the area has huge tourism potential. How does the Minister  intend to enhance that potential?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: I  am sure that the First Minister, who is present, will endorse the Member&rsquo;s  comments about Armagh, as it is his  birthplace.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will be aware that the St Patrick/Christian  Heritage signature project, which is one of the five signature projects for  Northern Ireland, is primarily based in the urban centres of Armagh and  Downpatrick, although, obviously, it has a resonance for all of Northern  Ireland and wider afield. That project is extremely important, and the draft  Budget is providing &pound;3&middot;5 million to take it forward. A revised action plan will  be produced to: develop key sites along the trail of places associated with St  Patrick; engage with the private sector, and extend the product across Northern Ireland and into the Irish Republic.  The signposted St Patrick&rsquo;s Trail route will be ready for summer 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That ends questions on the ministerial statement.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Review of Domestic Rating Reform</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Finance and Personnel that he  wishes to make a statement regarding the review of domestic rating reform.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: I have just been made aware that  there is a difficulty in that, apparently, copies of my statement are not  outside the Chamber for Members. I do not know if that will make any difference  to proceedings. My statement is long, and I do not print, copy and distribute  it myself, but I think Members would like to have it in their hands.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  On a point of order. It would be very difficult for Members to address themselves  to the statement and ask questions without having a copy. I would like a  decision on that, Mr Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: It might be useful if the Minister could clarify when the statement will be available to  Members.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: I have an empty box at the moment for some reason, so I am unable to give you a response.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Minister continue?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I will speak slowly to allow the Department to catch up with me.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am making an announcement today about the outcome of the  Executive&rsquo;s review of the domestic rating system that was introduced in April  under direct rule and fulfils the commitment  I made to the Assembly in June when publishing the terms of reference  for the review. Today&rsquo;s announcement, taken together with other recent announcements  on the draft Budget, will further demonstrate our commitment to making a real  difference for householders in Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must remember that  what really matters to people is the  level of rates that they have to pay, so any changes that we make need  to have that proviso. Annual rate increases must be kept to a minimum,  otherwise the whole system becomes discredited.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I set about the task even before taking office by ensuring,  along with others, that the link with the reinvestment and reform initiative  (RRI) was broken in advance of restoration. That link was ill conceived and  simply created the conditions in which there was no incentive to save money,  and higher rates became an end in itself. Let us not forget that the regional  rate went up by 62% over the past five years under the previous Administration.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My recent announcement on the draft Budget to freeze the domestic regional rate over the  comprehensive spending review period confirms my intentions in that  regard. That regional rates freeze, and this further package of reliefs, are in  addition to the commitment that we have given that householders will see the  benefit of the contribution they already make to the cost of water through  their rates &mdash; an average of &pound;160 per rates bill. Against that background I  present these proposals to the Assembly today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is only 195 days since I commissioned the review. In  that short time we have covered a lot of ground, generated much debate and consulted broadly; ultimately, we have  had to make difficult choices.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am confident that the package of proposals that I intend  to announce today is a balanced one that will lead to a more acceptable system  and a better distribution of the rating burden among householders in Northern Ireland.  However, I cannot pretend that it has been an easy task, particularly given the  timetable to which we were working &mdash; a timetable driven by the desire to make  changes in time for next year&rsquo;s bills. No one expected that it would be  straightforward, as will be found with any review that seeks to satisfy  competing interests.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the process has confirmed that we have to be realistic and recognise that if we had been  starting from square one, things  might have been very different. Radical change now will only lead to a  different set of winners and losers. Although I would be the first to recognise  the limitations of any property tax system, I believe that, with the right  checks and balances, the current system, based on capital values, can be made  much fairer. Getting the right checks and balances is, therefore, what I have  focused on, and is what I believe we have achieved through the package of  proposals that I am presenting to the Assembly today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Before I outline the proposals, I record my gratitude to  the 119 individuals and organisations that responded during the 12-week  consultation period that ended on 31 August 2007. Their informative and  considered responses have undoubtedly helped to shape the outcomes of the review, and I have made it my  business to ensure that the key messages conveyed through the process  have been addressed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for  Finance and Personnel also made a massive contribution to the process.  Its thorough and efficient approach was critical to the review timetable  remaining on track, and I am particularly grateful to the Chairman and members  for giving me advance sight of their report for that purpose. I am even more  pleased to report that the Committee&rsquo;s contribution can be clearly seen in the  outcome of the review, with many of our recommendations aligning.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will turn now to the proposals. Members will recall from  my earlier statements that the review was to  be taken forward in two strands in line with the terms of reference. Strand one involved a thorough  examination of the options for  change that could be delivered within the scope of the existing primary  legislation in time for next year&rsquo;s rates  bills. Under that strand we also looked at ways in which that  legislation could be changed to further improve the system in the medium term.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Strand two concentrated on  longer-term options for raising revenue through local taxation, either as  alternatives or supplements to the domestic rating system. That approach has  led to the preparation of a number of proposals, which are presented to the  Assembly as a cohesive package. In my view, they complement one another well,  providing the right balance between protecting those most affected by the  previous reforms and those most in need, namely our pensioners, and also attending to wider policy objectives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In summary, the package includes proposals for a 20%  single-pensioner discount for ratepayers aged 70 and over and living alone; an  increase in savings thresholds from &pound;16,000  to &pound;50,000 for pensioners under the existing lower-income relief scheme;  measures to improve the take-up of relief; the introduction of a deferment  scheme as a choice for pensioners who own their own homes; a reduction in the  maximum capital value; the rating of empty homes; rebates to encourage the  provision of energy-efficiency measures for homes in Northern Ireland; and further evaluation and consultation on  student rate relief and possible alternatives, with a view to abolishing it.  Lastly, there will be further work on the option of introducing a derelict-land  tax in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The key changes for  next year will be the introduction of  a single-pensioner discount set at 20% for ratepayers aged 70 and over  and living alone, and the proposed increase in the savings limit applied under  the low-income rate-relief scheme from &pound;16,000 to &pound;50,000 for pensioners. Those  are targeted measures, and I believe that they will have an immediate and  positive impact for a relatively modest cost. That cost will be borne by the  regional rate, rather than by other ratepayers. Both can also be provided for through subordinate legislation,  subject, of course, to the approval of the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The increase in the current savings limit is to ensure that  pensioners who have saved for their retirement do not find themselves ineligible  for rate relief. It is in line with the first-step recommendations of the Lyons  Report, and also reflects the considerable support for such a change during the  consultation process. The measure is also  supported by the Committee for Finance and Personnel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to that and  the extra reliefs for pensioners that were secured during the St Andrews  negotiations, I want to address the  difficulties facing single pensioners &mdash; in particular, those which are a  result of the reforms that were introduced  under direct rule. The responses that were  received during the consultation &mdash; many of which were from single  pensioners &mdash; seem to support that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Analysis that has been undertaken with the help of experts  from the Department for Social Development (DSD) has highlighted as a major shortcoming the low take-up of existing reliefs among that group. That is  why I am also proposing the introduction of  a lone-pensioner discount from April 2008 for those who are over 70  years of age. However, I am not in favour of extending that discount to all  single householders. Such a widespread  discount would be difficult to justify on grounds of cost, need and  vulnerability to fraud.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Last week there was much talk in the media about a  single-person discount, and claims that, by not harmonising with arrangements  that apply under the council-tax system in Great   Britain, Northern    Ireland is being unfairly treated. It is  important that people fully understand that a discount given to any group &mdash;  whether deserving or not &mdash; must, in the long run, be paid for through other  ratepayers&rsquo; paying more. The cost of a discount for single-person households  would be of the order of magnitude of &pound;30 million a year. It is difficult to  argue that single-person households represent a vulnerable group that requires  such a level of support. Indeed, I pose the question of whether it would be  right for young families struggling with large mortgages to be required to pay  a supplement in order to pay for people who are affluent but living alone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have two further points about the proposal for a  single-pensioner discount. In its report, the Committee for Finance and  Personnel supported the introduction of such a discount for people over 75  years of age. However, on the basis that it  would have a much greater impact, particularly in assisting with the  major issue of take-up levels, my view is  that the age threshold should be 70. I will continue to review whether  even lower age thresholds might be justified in the future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Currently, the evidence shows that people who have recently retired from employment are in a better  position to pay their rates bill and to avail of rate rebates or  low-income relief. According to the family resources survey, the average weekly  income of recently-retired single pensioners is 30% higher than that of single  pensioners as a whole. That survey also shows that the average income of single  female pensioners &mdash; who make up the vast majority of single pensioners &mdash; aged 70 to 74 is approximately 28% lower than for  those aged 60 to 64, and 15% lower than for those aged 75 to 79.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I propose that the discount level be set at 20%. That, in conjunction with the other proposed support  measures such as the increased savings limit, will provide an adequate  level of support. The discount will be applied after other reliefs &mdash; including  transitional relief &mdash; have been awarded, in order that the target group will  effectively get, and clearly see, the benefit of a 20% reduction in their  bills.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Before moving on to the proposals for April 2009 and  beyond, I will deal with the important issue of the low take-up levels of  reliefs in Northern Ireland.  As the report of the Lyons Inquiry into local government in England shows, that issue is not unique to Northern Ireland.  However, urgent action is clearly required here, particularly in the  owner-occupied sector, where the take-up rate for those who are eligible for  the new lower-income rate-relief scheme is estimated to be 42%. As I said,  pensioners, in particular, are not taking up that relief. A review of good  practice in benefit take-up levels elsewhere has highlighted a number of broad  actions that might be taken in order to improve rates-relief take-up levels in Northern Ireland.  The Committee has recommended that those actions should be vigorously pursued.  In light of that, and as a matter of urgency, I propose to commission a study,  led by the voluntary and community sector, to identify actions that might be  taken to support Government awareness and take-up strategies next year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The possibility of new legislation giving increased  data-sharing powers to relevant agencies will also be examined as a matter of  urgency.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That will be subject to the completion of a privacy impact assessment to protect the interests of our  citizens and to ensure that the data is safeguarded.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As well as the proposals for next year, I am pleased to  present several further proposals to the Assembly that will take slightly  longer to implement but will provide further checks and balances to ensure that  the overall system is as fair as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Staying on the theme of  pensioners, the first proposal is for the introduction of a voluntary  deferment scheme for homeowning pensioners.  Essentially, it will involve rolling up rate payments at a concessionary  rate of interest until the sale of the house and then securing the debt by  creating a charge on the property. Such schemes are not uncommon in other  jurisdictions. Although take-up is usually very low because of inheritance  considerations, such a scheme can suit better-off pensioners who are beyond the  income limits of the lower income relief scheme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Such a scheme would  require subordinate legislation to be passed, which could be achieved by  April 2008, subject to the Assembly&rsquo;s approval. However, complex administrative  arrangements must be developed before it could be fully implemented, and  further consultation on the detailed mechanisms would be desirable. Therefore,  April 2009 has been set as the earliest date for the introduction of a  deferment scheme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Looking more widely, another successful outcome of the St Andrews negotiations last year was the introduction of  a maximum cap set on properties with a capital value of &pound;500,000 or more. It is  clear that that move has helped to allay  some of the public&rsquo;s fear about the excessive impact of the new system.  However, is the cap set at the right level? My view is that it is not, and I am  attracted to the idea of setting it at the lower level of &pound;400,000. Although  the number of households that would directly benefit from such a move would be  fairly low &mdash; about 5,000 in total &mdash; it would bring the highest bills under the  rating system here into line with the average bills in the highest band of the  council-tax system. That is a fairer comparator than the absolute highest  council-tax bill, which provided the rationale behind the initial cap level.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I shall consult further on the issue, as I am keen to take  account of developments on water charging and, in particular, what cap, if any,  will be proposed there. Bearing that in mind, I propose to reduce the cap in  April 2009, with final confirmation of its level to be made following  consultation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">So far, I have dealt  with some of the necessary checks that the rating system must have if it  is to be fair, but what about the balances?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A popular measure during the consultation exercise, and  with the Committee for Finance and Personnel, was the rating of vacant domestic  property &mdash; not least because of the potential net revenue gain it could yield.  Taking account of exemptions, and assuming that the DFP agency responsible for rate collection &mdash; Land and Property  Services &mdash;&mdash; is fully equipped and resourced to implement the policy, the  revenue gain could be in the region of &pound;15 million to &pound;20 million per annum.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the policy is  more than a device for raising revenue; it could assist with wider  policy objectives, such as housing affordability. That was the subject of the  recent Semple Report, which is being taken forward by the Department for Social  Development. Given its clear benefits, I propose to introduce the rating of  vacant domestic property at a rate of 100% at the earliest possible  opportunity, which will most likely be April 2009.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That date will give us time to consider the outcomes of the  work being undertaken by the University   of Ulster, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) and  the Department for Social Development&rsquo;s working group on housing affordability.  It will also allow us to further assess and consult on the issue before taking  decisions on items such as exemptions or exempt periods that might need to be  applied.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The review of domestic rating reform also looked at the  longer term and considered options as alternatives or supplements to the current rating system. One option that  should be carefully considered is the taxing of derelict or vacant land. That would be a complementary measure to the taxing of vacant houses. The idea  proved popular during the consultation exercise, and the Committee for Finance and Personnel has  recommended that it be given serious consideration.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the measure could bring in much-needed additional revenue to help fund public services,  it could also help to satisfy other wider policy considerations, such as  ensuring that there is sufficient supply of development land available. Thus it  would assist two policy aims: that of providing affordable housing and that of  stimulating economic growth.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In announcing our intention to examine that in greater  detail, I emphasise that today is merely a first step. We need to consider  carefully the positive and negative effects that such a taxation measure could  have. A delicate balance has to be drawn to ensure that it frees up land for  development by providing a disincentive to holding it back, but at the same  time does not cause such an imposition on developers that it affects the  viability of urban development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Before we can make any decisions about including the  measure in legislation, we will have to examine the matter in greater detail  and consult with those likely to be affected by such a measure. Therefore, in  proceeding with the proposal, I will be working closely with other Departments,  particularly the Department for Social Development and, given its role in  planning, the Department of the Environment. Depending on the outcome of those  considerations, the introduction of a tax on derelict land may simply be an  extension of the existing non-domestic rating system, or it may be a new local  tax, in which case, it may require changes to the Northern Ireland Act 1998.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the responses  to the consultation considered that local taxation should be used in a  positive way by serving as an incentive to  act in a more environmentally responsible manner. That aligns with my  Department&rsquo;s wider commitment to promote  sustainable development. Therefore, I wholeheartedly support that  aspiration, provided, of course, that it can be delivered in a cost-effective  way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Having considered the matter in light of the consultation  responses and the Committee&rsquo;s report, I intend to proceed with the option of  providing rate rebates that offer the potential to improve the energy  efficiency of our housing stock. I am proposing two measures.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">First, I want to provide  a rate rebate to existing homes that make energy-efficiency  improvements, such as cavity-wall and loft  insulation. Similar schemes already operate in some local authorities in  England,  part-funded by schemes set up and supported by the energy generators there.  That proposal was submitted during the  consultation by the World Wide Fund for Nature, and my officials, along  with DETI and other stakeholders, are examining it in some detail.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, I am  proposing an initial rate exemption for the first purchase of new homes  that are zero-carbon-rated. However, there are some issues of definition, funding and alignment with other initiatives that  have to be worked through regarding those matters. Therefore, I intend  to ask my Department, working with the Committee  for Finance and Personnel, other Departments such as DETI, and  stakeholders such as NIE, to draw up detailed proposals with a view to  introducing new primary legislation to be implemented in April 2009.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The review also  critically examined some of the new relief schemes that were introduced  in April this year. One of those was the rate-relief scheme for people in  full-time education and training. That scheme attracted much criticism during  the consultation process. Many of the respondents thought that the benefit of  the relief was going into the pockets of landlords rather than students. Others  questioned the effectiveness of the relief, and a number questioned whether  that particular group should be a priority  for the provision of rate relief.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The review also  considered the number of applications that have been received so far  this year for that relief, which is fewer  than 500. That, in itself, draws into question the effectiveness of the  policy. Therefore, I am minded to revoke the scheme, providing we can  reasonably protect those who have already  applied. However, before doing so, an evaluation of the policy and  consultation with key stakeholders on the  outcome of that evaluation are necessary.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">So far, I have described what I want to do, provided I get  the consent of the Assembly. I will now outline some of the longer-term options  that I propose not to pursue, including banding. Although the system of  individual capital values has the merit of being easier to understand than  banding, I can see advantages to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s having a system  such as the council tax. It is restrained in that those at the top end pay no  more than three times as much as those at the bottom end. That makes it more  like a charge for services than the rates.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Notwithstanding the  increasing sensitivities regarding council tax in GB &mdash; which I believe  has more to do with overloading the system &mdash; we could design our own version.  However, I recognise that we are not starting from square one. Another  fundamental change in the way that local revenues are distributed among  householders in Northern    Ireland would not only cause more confusion  and upheaval, but create a new set of winners and losers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Winners tend to stay  quiet; losers do the opposite. The political consequences of changing  the order of things again should not be underestimated. That in itself is not a  reason to show a faint heart &mdash; those who know me cannot accuse me of that.  However, I cannot ignore the fact that no  significant support for banding emerged from the consultation exercise,  witnesses to the Committee for Finance and Personnel, or Committee members  themselves. I will not, therefore, take that option forward, but I have agreed  to provide the Committee with an update of the analysis of banding that was  undertaken when direct rule Ministers decided to proceed with individual  capital values.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another major matter that I propose not to take forward is that of a local income tax. That was  favoured by many ratepayers who responded to the consultation, although  the majority of organisations were against it. It has attractions, in that it  offers the prospect of aligning liability more closely with ability to pay. The  public perception is understandable, therefore, and it mirrors &mdash; and is  mirrored &mdash; in England, where, during the Lyons Review, the overwhelming  majority of those who were surveyed thought that they would be much better off  if subject to a local income tax, rather than the existing council tax.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the reality is somewhat different. It is estimated  that a local income tax would cost income-tax  payers in Northern Ireland  a further 7p in the pound, if we were to raise the same amount of money  as is accrued through domestic rates. That is also a tax on work, and therefore  it is not in keeping with the Executive&rsquo;s priority of economic growth. There  are serious concerns about the ability and willingness of HM Revenue and  Customs to support the introduction and administration of such a scheme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That said, I do not think that we must close the door on it entirely: we can learn lessons from  elsewhere, and particularly from Scotland. The Scottish Government  have recently decided to abolish council tax and replace it with a local income  tax. I understand that that is to be the subject of a public consultation in  the coming months. As Scotland proceeds at pace with a local income tax, it is  my view, shared by the Committee for Finance and Personnel, that it may be best  to maintain a watching brief on developments there for the time being, rather  than commission further work of our own on that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another issue that was examined during the review was that  of circuit-breakers, which is the curious title given to relief schemes found  in some parts of North America, whereby a  limit is placed on the percentage of income that defined groups &mdash; pensioners,  or ex-service personnel, etc &mdash; are required to pay in property tax. At first  sight, that seems an attractive option. However, several factors effectively  rule it out as a realistic option for consideration in the Northern Ireland  context. Research shows that, where circuit-breakers exist, there tends not to  be the safety nets of other reliefs for the poorest households, such as those  that exist in Northern    Ireland through the UK-funded housing  benefit system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Introducing circuit-breakers here would, therefore, cause major complications in working alongside  housing benefit and, potentially, could shift the funding of the support  of vulnerable groups from annually managed expenditure to the departmental  expenditure limit. Introducing a circuit-breaker system would also be  administratively complex, given the need to gather detailed information on the  income of all ratepaying households. It will also be vulnerable to fraud. I,  therefore, propose not to pursue that option further.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-weight:normal; ">I  shall now say more about the developments, on which I touched earlier, in  respect of water charges. On 15 May 2007, I told the Assembly that I agreed  with the Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel that it is important that rating reform be viewed  in the context of how the Executive intend to address the funding of water in Northern Ireland.</span></strong></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-weight:normal; ">Since  then, the Independent Water Review Panel has  published its first report. The panel recommended that a single bill be issued to households, with  rates and water charges separately identified. The Executive have agreed  that that proposal should be examined by both the Department for Regional  Development and the Department of Finance  and Personnel, working together to determine whether and how that might  be done. That is now happening. At this stage, there are no conclusions to  report to the Assembly.</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size:14.0pt; font-weight:normal; "> </span></strong></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><strong><span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; font-size:11.0pt; font-weight:normal; ">However, I am anxious that the rating reforms that</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-weight:normal; "> I have announced today are not  jeopardised either by the substantial work on IT systems or possible  legislative changes that may be required to provide a single bill for water and  rates. Many difficult issues must be addressed, not least the fact that the panel  is still working on recommendations for a new affordability tariff scheme, the outcome of which could have a major  bearing on the ease with which a single bill can be delivered.</span></strong></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, I have signalled that people will not be  asked to pay twice for water and that there will be an off-setting arrangement  with the domestic rates; work on that is  proceeding. I will provide the Assembly with further information on that  proposal as soon as possible, after the Minister for Regional Development and I  report to the ministerial subgroup and the Executive in the new year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Next steps include the publication of a paper later this  week that will set out the findings of the rating review in detail, including  the options considered and those that were not recommended. Some immediate  actions must be progressed over the coming months in order to implement the  proposals: first, in order to advance the recommendations on single-pensioner discount, I will need to engage in a targeted  consultation exercise that takes on board the views of all interested  parties before introducing subordinate legislation for April 2008. At the same time, I will progress subordinate  legislation to raise the savings limit for pensioners to &pound;50,000 from April  2008. After that, I will begin work on pre-legislative tasks such as the  integrated impact assessments and the consultation that is required to  introduce the proposals for the rating of vacant  domestic property, the proposed deferment scheme for pensioners, an  agreed revision to the maximum capital value, and any legislation that is  required on rate relief for those in full-time education and training.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the same time, I will engage in preparatory work  associated with the primary legislation required to intro&shy;duce the new rate  rebate for energy efficiency and zero carbon housing. Work will also be  required on the legislative implications of the longer-term changes such as  derelict land taxation and improved data sharing to facilitate relief take-up.  That will require considerable research and discussion with some of my  ministerial colleagues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have outlined cohesive measures to improve the rating  system in Northern Ireland  to help those most adversely affected or most in need and also to assist in  fulfilling broader policy aims.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have learnt through the review that reform of the rating  system does not operate in isolation. Every new concession has a cost, either  to other ratepayers or to the public purse.  This is devolved taxation, and shortfalls are not made up from  Government subventions. We must, therefore, adopt a measured and proportionate  approach to changing the system through targeting support where it is required.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I shall, therefore, keep those measures under review.  Raising more money from rating empty homes and derelict land could allow us to  enhance some reliefs further; for instance extending the scope of the  single-pensioner discount.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No matter what we do, reform cannot possibly satisfy  everyone, and we should not try to do that by over-engineering the system &mdash;  that could have unforeseen consequences.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It should be remembered that the rating system&rsquo;s influence  can be wide in other important policy areas such housing affordability,  sustainable development and water reform.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said at the outset, what really matters is what people  are asked to pay. Today&rsquo;s proposals will benefit many ratepayers and, taken  together with the Budget proposals, will offer many households much needed  relief.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much remains to be done to see the process through to its  conclusion, but in making the changes, we are returning the faith that people  demonstrated by sending us here. I commend the measures to the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before I call the Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel, I  remind Members of the nature of the statement: Members must question the  Minister on the statement, not make further statements.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McLaughlin)</strong>: That sounded  very pointed, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the initial tranche of domestic rating reforms  that the Minister has announced and the fact that so many of them align closely  with many of the Committee&rsquo;s recommendation. I agree that the reforms improve  the domestic rating system. A good beginning is half the work, as the Irish  saying goes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister clarify how the single-pensioner discount  of 20% for over-70s will work in practice? Will it apply, for example, in a  situation where two unmarried members of  the same family live in the same household? Will the Minister state  whether he is prepared to consider widening  the scope of the discount? Will the Minister outline what the revenue  outcomes are likely to be as a result of the reforms that have been announced  today?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Chairman of the Committee for  Finance and Personnel for the assistance that his Committee gave to me  and my Department during the Budget  process. I have said, in my statement, that it is important that &mdash; in  many ways &mdash; the reliefs can pay for  themselves. The steps that we have taken, in looking at issues such as  the rating of vacant properties and derelict land, will release further funds  and will, therefore, allow us to consider further reliefs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was attracted to a  lower level of assistance for senior citizens. If, and when, we can afford  to do so, I will return to that issue. I have spoken to the Committee&rsquo;s  Chairman about that matter. At the present time, we are concerned with those  aged 70 years and over who live alone. We will consult on that issue. There are  some occasions when, for example, there is a medical requirement that a carer  should live with someone. Should a person&rsquo;s bad health disqualify them from having that benefit? Therefore, we will look at  particular cases during the consultation process, and I am happy to work  with the Committee in resolving those matters.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Effectively, the reliefs will not be a charge on other  ratepayers &mdash; it is important that we make that point at this stage. If we can  release further resources by increasing the rate income, we will return to the  relief levels and age groups.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I welcome several aspects of the Minister&rsquo;s statement, in  particular, his decision to introduce a tax on vacant properties. The Ulster  Unionist Party is a prudent party that  encourages positive forms of taxation. Although I welcome the  single-pensioner discount, I note that it is limited to single pensioners and  those aged 70 and over. Will the Minister explain why he has not taken up the suggestion, made by the  Committee for Finance and Personnel,  to introduce a universal pension for all those who are aged 75 and over?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: The Member, who is on the Com&shy;mittee for Finance and Personnel,  should take another look at that Committee&rsquo;s report. The Finance and Personnel  Committee proposed a discount for those who are aged 75 and over and who live  alone. I have gone a step further by reducing the eligibility age for the  single-pensioner discount to 70. I shall look again at the issue to see whether  we can do something more in rate relief when we  release further resources. My preference, particularly if I take into  account the issue of take-up, is to have some form of automaticity about the  process so that people are not required to  apply for the relief. However, there will be a time lag on that.  Therefore, for the first bills, payment will have to be by application.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr Storey)</strong>: I, too,  thank the Minister for his statement and for the good practice that his  Department has engaged in when dealing with the Committee on the review. The  Committee looks forward to further work on  potential long-term reforms.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The decision to increase the savings limit for pensioners,  which applies under the existing lower-income rate-relief scheme, from &pound;16,000  to &pound;50,000 is in line with the Committee&rsquo;s recommendation. Will the Minister  comment on the extent to which that is likely to boost the uptake of reliefs?  Moreover, will he comment on the measures that can be taken to ensure that Northern Ireland  does not lose out by funding that uplift locally, were the UK Government to  follow suit by raising savings levels as part of a wider reform of housing  benefit?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I did not bring my crystal ball with me, so my answer cannot be too exact. With  regard to the latter point, we might reverse our decisions fairly quickly so  that the burden would be on annually managed expenditure, rather than on the  departmental expenditure limits.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There would be no need for us to carry that burden if the  Treasury was going to carry it. We would re-examine the situation in those  circumstances. The expectation is that the cost will be reasonably modest, but  it can be calculated only after the system has been in use for a period of  time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I congratulate the Minister on the review and on the timely fashion in which it has been  presented. I accept the Minister&rsquo;s contention that a property tax with  checks and balances is probably as good as it gets at present. The broad thrust  of the Minister&rsquo;s proposals improves those checks and balances.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed reduction of the rates cap would be  revenue-neutral. Therefore, it would transfer the burden from relatively well-off households to relatively  worse-off households. Does the Minister not accept that that would be a  regressive policy? How does the Minister square his rejection of the  circuit-breaker concept, given the affordability tariff on water? The strand 1  report of the independent water review panel led  by Professor Paddy Hillyard has stated that proposals will be made on a  water-charge affordability tariff in strand 2 of that review. If it is possible  to proceed with that action on one hand, why does the Minister reject it on the  other?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The reduction of the rates cap will go out to consultation, and further work  will be carried out to determine whether  that would simply be regarded as lost revenue or reapplied within the  rates burden. The Department will make some assessment for the Committee of the  extent of any loss of rate revenue if that change were to be made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a balance to be drawn on whether that is a tax, or  a payment for a service. At some point, we must decide whether people have  overpaid for that service. Rather than go to the highest band in GB, the  Department&rsquo;s position is that we should take the mid-point of the highest band  in GB, which we believe is fair. That is  why we are looking at a limit of &pound;400,000. I will provide such  statistics as I can to the Member&rsquo;s Committee.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To some extent, Ministers cannot win. If there are ideas  that Members like, they wonder why we do not press ahead with them, but when  there is no support for those ideas in the consultation process, we are asked  whether we should go ahead with them. Those are the issues that must be taken  into account. Overall, I have produced what I believe to be a balanced set of  proposals and measures. I hope that they are sufficient to attract the support  of the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. There are many aspects to be welcomed,  such as the single-pensioner discount, the rating  of vacant property, and the energy-efficiency measures. However, does  the Minister not recognise that a local income tax would be simpler than  bringing an effectively property-based system with checks and balances more  into line with the ability to pay through a complex system of reliefs?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What consideration did  the Minister give to replacing only the regional rate with a local  income tax, rather than both the regional rate and the district rate? Will the  Minister give the House some idea of his wider approach to green taxes such as  pay-as-you-throw schemes, reliefs for people who recycle, congestion charges,  or road tolls?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Whatever a change from the rating system to an income-tax-based system might  be, it certainly would not be simpler. We all know of the upheaval that has  been caused over the years by the change in the system. Any change, even if it  is for the better, will have considerable  consequences for the body politic. Everyone knows that, no matter what  system we change to, we will simply create a new group of winners and a new  group of losers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The real difficulty with introducing a local income tax system is the fact that economic growth is  the priority for Northern Ireland.  A tax on work or, more accurately, a tax on workers is not the best way  in which to encourage that growth. We have  an opportunity to stand back, observe  the Scottish model and learn lessons from it. If there are mistakes to  be made, let the Scottish Government make them, and we will learn from their  experience. We are not ruling out completely the idea of introducing a local  income tax, but we can look and learn from the Scottish model over the next few  years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have taken the right  decision. It is better to remove the sharp edges from the existing  system, make it fairer and address the issue of people&rsquo;s ability to pay, rather  than change the system and go into the unknown, as the Member for North Down  would like us to do.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his thorough statement and for his measures to set the  qualifying age for lone pensioner discount to 70, in particular. That will  enable more pensioners to qualify than if the age had been set at 75.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">First, does the  Minister agree with the expert opinion given to the Committee that there  are no examples in the world of circuit-breakers having been introduced  effectively in a domestic rating situation? Secondly, will there be an initial  exemption period for the introduction of rates for vacant domestic properties?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  There was a second element to the question from the Member for North Down Dr  Farry. He raised issues about green taxes and whether there was scope for  further reform. I am happy to discuss the matter with him and his colleagues to  consider whether there is such scope. A consultation process will be carried  out on the exercise, and we will attempt to make some progress on those issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My honourable friend Mr Weir asked whether I accepted the  expert opinion on circuit-breakers. I am loath to go against expert opinion on  anything, and I have reached a similar conclusion to the experts. Therefore, I  am happy to accept their views.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There will be a consultation process, and that will allow  us to consider the introduction of rates for vacant properties. There may be  cases where some properties shall be exempt entirely, and I am sure that some  people will want to put forward such proposals. There may be cases for  exemption periods, such as the time between a property being vacated &mdash; the  interregnum &mdash; and being sold or re-let. There are issues relating to blighted  properties or ones that have been purchased for demolition that we must  consider. Therefore, it is difficult to establish the exemptions that we will  finally agree to. The Committee and the House will want to examine those issues  during the consultation process.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement,  particularly with regard to pensioners. The Committee recommended that the availability of automatic rate relief to  people of pensionable age should be given further consideration. What is the  Minister&rsquo;s thinking on that?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  It is an important issue. I agree entirely with the Member and with the  Committee. However, it is difficult to consider the matter at this stage. I  would like to involve Age Concern, Help the Aged and other organisations so  that we can have evidence as to why there has not been a higher take-up in rate  relief. During Question Time yesterday, I mentioned  that the uptake had been approximately 40% for those in owner-occupied  properties, between 60% and 70% for those in privately rented properties and  over 90% for those in public-sector rented properties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That shows that there is a need for considerable movement,  particularly on the owner-occupied sector. If an automatic system can be  established whereby people do not have to apply for rate relief, we will be  able to improve the situation.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If we consider the sectors that are most affected by this  matter, it is clear that, to some extent, there is a stigma attached to  claiming rate relief. People do not want to apply for what they consider to be  handouts; we must change the culture and make it clear that rate relief is an  entitlement rather than a handout. I suspect that if those people went into a  clothes shop in Belfast,  they would be among the first to look for a 10% or 15% discount, and that they  would have no difficulty with doing that. Indeed, they would feel that they  were entitled to ask for such a discount, and, if it was offered, to take it.  Rate relief should be no different; it is an entitlement not a handout, and  people should apply for it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his very detailed statement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for  Finance and Personnel examined the  issue of enhanced discount for farmers, and it decided that the option  would be considered in the context of decisions on other reforms. If a farmer  has a property with an agricultural occupancy clause, it will be worth much  less than similar properties, yet it seems unfair that the householder should  have to pay rates to that effect. I understand from my discussions with estate  agents that the value of such a property is probably 40% &mdash; perhaps even 50% &mdash;  less than it should be.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In his statement, the Minister outlines proposals for  vacant properties and the moneys that such proposals could raise. I think that it was suggested that &pound;10 million could be raised by 2009. Will the Minister also  consider reviewing the enhancement discount for farmers?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I admire my colleague&rsquo;s ability to put forward the case for the farming  community at all times, and he is right to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I understand it, a benefit has been built in for the  farming community, in that farms are reduced in valuation because they are  farms, and in recognition of the fact that they can be sold only in a limited  market. I am happy to consider whether there should be any distinction between farms per se and those  agriculturally tied properties that,  in many cases, were given planning permission only because of their  farming connection and which cannot be used for any purpose other than for  farming. I am always willing to consider and review matters, but, on this occasion,  it was felt that the discount that has already been built in to the system for  farmers was suitable and appropriate.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  too thank the Minister for his timely statement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Can the Minister provide an assurance that derelict land  taxation will not be used to encourage &ldquo;garden-grabbing&rdquo; or to impose further  taxation on the beleaguered farming community? Can he further assure the House  that the proposed taxation will apply to developers who hold land banks and  brownfield sites for future development so that such development can be  encouraged?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I assure the Member that I do not propose to tax his garden. The idea behind  derelict land taxation is that it would particularly apply to sites that have  been zoned for housing but which are being held back for commercial reasons and  for profit. It would ensure that there is a flow of land into the property  market, rather than encourage land-banking. It would therefore help the housing  Minister to work towards her goal of ensuring that more affordable housing is  made available.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, I am not talking about agricultural land. Let me  kill off that idea just in case anyone should think that that is the route that  is being taken &mdash; I do not want to be lynched by the farmers. The proposal will  involve derelict land that has been identified for housing but which is not  being used for that purpose.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. I appreciate that his focus has been on  ensuring that change is deliverable next year and the year after, and I  recognise too that some of the more radical options that have been suggested  probably could not have been delivered in that time frame.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister clarify whether circuit-breakers will be  applied specifically to pensioner households &mdash; not just to single-pensioner  households, but to couples as well? It has been argued that if circuit-breakers were applied more widely, they would be  open to abuse. However, if one were focused on pensioner households, as  was the intention under direct rule when there was a circuit-breaking  affordability tariff in respect of water charges as recommended by the Consumer  Council, would that not work?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Other areas of Government are, rightly, encouraging  pensioners to take up pension credit, which is based on a minimum-income  guarantee and is their entitlement. In such circumstances, could there not be a  cross-reference in the rating system guaranteeing that pensioners will not have  rating liabilities that will, in effect, bring them below the minimum-income  guarantee for pension credit? That cross-linking could serve to encourage the  take-up of pension credit as well as the take-up of rate relief measures.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  On the latter point, there is an awful lot that could be done if there were  greater crossover of data in Government. However, that has other implications  about which we must be satisfied. Some of the data relating to the rating  system is held in places other than in my Department. Therefore, data sharing  would be required. Those matters could not have been resolved in the short  term. However, all changes can be considered: they can come at any time if they  have merit.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as circuit-breakers are concerned, during the  consultation process there was not the kind of support for pensioner households  that the Member believes there was. However, that is not the only reason why it  was discarded. The view held by officials is that it did not sit easily and  could be disruptive to some of the benefit systems. The Department will do  further work to determine whether there are ways around those difficulties and whether there are benefits in  introducing some kind of circuit-breaking system.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Like other Members, I welcome much of what the Minister has delivered to the  House. However, will he expand his explanation  of the benefits that the measures on vacant properties will have on the  hard-pressed housing sector?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  A number of advantages will flow from those  measures. Clearly, there will be the advantage of providing further  rating income. As far as benefits to affordable housing are concerned, if  people know that they cannot leave their houses empty in the hope that rent  levels or sale values will increase, they will know that there is a cost  attached. If they are leaving property vacant for financial reasons, there will  be an encouragement, or incentive, for them to put their houses back on the  market either for sale or to let. Essentially, the measures are a disincentive  for people to leave property empty for profit and will allow a lot of property  to come back on the market.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is estimated that there is a large number of vacant  properties in Northern    Ireland: clearly, that must be dealt with. As property values have risen so  extensively in recent years, there was a view that if people held off selling their houses, their properties would  become more valuable. Therefore, they did not put those properties back  on the market, and that has denied other people houses and has made properties  less affordable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The measures fit in with the policy objectives of the  Department for Social Development and should assist, as a policy lever, to make  more properties available on the market.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement and welcome how much it mirrors the  Committee for Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s  report on the review of domestic rating.  In fact, in many instances, it enhances the report&rsquo;s proposals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I particularly welcome the increase in the savings limit.  Does the Minister have any plans to abolish the savings threshold as proposed  in the Lyons Report with regard to council tax?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  On the Member&rsquo;s first point, I can only say that great minds think alike. We  have reached the same destination and taken the same journey. <em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I can hear what other Members think about that. The savings  threshold has been increased from &pound;16,000 to &pound;50,000, which, in all  circumstances, is reasonable. In respect of  the removal of the threshold, the Lyons Report asked us to sit back and  watch, and that is exactly what we shall do. We will look at how the &pound;50,000  impacts on the householders and whether there is a cause for further revision and removal. I had considered  increasing the savings threshold even further, and one of the big issues  that will impact on that is increases in the property market, so we will  regularly examine our threshold levels to ensure that they are kept in line  with the property market.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. Considering that such a small percentage of people avail of rates  relief, I am grateful that the Minister has commissioned a study, led by the  voluntary and community sector, to promote awareness of the take-up strategies.  Does the Minister have any plans to go further and finance and resource the voluntary  and community sector so that the campaign  is bedded in the community, thus  making it more effective in its delivery?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I want to hear what the voluntary and community sector has to say and what it  believes will make a difference in take-up levels. If repre&shy;sentatives of that  sector have specific proposals that need to  be funded, I will examine them. I am considering the pursuance of one possible reason for the low take-up &mdash; the  amount of form filling that is involved. The form filling may appear  complicated to some people, particularly senior citizens, and assistance may be  required to complete the forms. Therefore, there may well be value in  representatives from Help the Aged or Age Concern travelling around areas and  offering advice and assistance on form filling. That is the type of area that I  am prepared to examine if the voluntary and community sector confirms that the  complication of form filling is one of the  reasons for the poor take-up of reliefs. The introduction of some  automaticity into the process so that people will not have to apply for some of  those reliefs will also help.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement on what can only be good news for the  people of Northern Ireland.  Will the Minister state why he is proposing to reduce the level of the cap?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I have already said that I chose the reduced level because it brings us into  the average of the highest band in Great Britain, which is fair and,  therefore, a fairly good comparator. That takes some of the pain out of the  rate-paying process if a substantial part of the regional rate is regarded as  being payment for services, but there must be some linkage with the services  that people are receiving, and there must be an upper limit to that. If the GB level is on the top banding &mdash; set  as it is &mdash; our circumstances are such that the midpoint of that top banding is  the appropriate place to pitch, and that is why I pitched the cap at &pound;400,000.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, a consultation process is under way, and it would be advantageous to link our cap level to  whatever limit is proposed for water charging &mdash; if possible. I hope that  the Minister for Regional Development will consider the introduction of an  upper limit for water charging and that we will be able to co-ordinate the two  payments.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s intentions to reward households that make  energy-efficiency improvements. Will that  reward apply equally to homes that have been modernised? What percentage  of the initial rate will be rebated to owners of new homes that are zero-carbon  rated?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I have not set the percentage, or level, of the rate rebate, because my  Department is first required to carry out a  consultation process. I am happy to  hear suggestions from Mr Armstrong &mdash; or any other Members &mdash; on where  that level should be pitched. If I have understood him correctly, the Member  asked whether the rebate would be retrospective for homes that already have  such efficiency measures installed. That too is an issue for the consultation  process. My view is that any homes with those efficiency measures should  receive the full advantage of the rebate, irrespective of when they were  installed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: The Minister referred to rising house prices. Given the  soaring prices across Northern    Ireland in the past 18 months, with which  everyone is familiar, will the Minister advise the House on what impact that  will have on rate bills at the next revaluation?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I could go on and on about that, because there is a misconception, if not a  deliberate attempt by some members of the press to mislead the public, on that  subject. If the price of everyone&rsquo;s house were to rise by the same percentage,  there would be no change in the quantum of their rate bills. A change only  takes place when the value of someone&rsquo;s property increases at a higher rate  from that of others, in which case they will pay a higher amount of the overall  total. The overall amount of revenue  collected does not change; only the distribution within it. If someone&rsquo;s  property decreases in value relative to the overall average in Northern Ireland, their rate bill will decrease;  if the value of their property goes up vis-&agrave;-vis the overall value of  properties in Northern    Ireland, their rate bill will go up. It is  not the case that everyone&rsquo;s rate bills will increase simply because of an  increase in the overall value of property in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>:  Although some pensioners in my South Belfast  constituency will benefit from the proposal, many others will continue to pay  high rates because of the value of their property. Many pensioners argue that a rate bill still based on property value is  unfair, whereas a local income tax would not penalise working people.  They have worked all their lives and, on retirement, want to look forward to  life without having to worry about high  rate bills. What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on that?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Every pensioner who lives alone in South Belfast,  and elsewhere in the Province, will benefit from the package that I have  announced today. Indeed, the rise in the savings limit for pensioners from  &pound;16,000 to &pound;50,000 will probably be of particular benefit to those living in South Belfast. Except where I expressly indicated  otherwise in my statement, all existing reliefs remain in place. The reliefs  that I have announced today are additional  reliefs and, therefore, the package  as a whole improves the position for everyone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot agree with the Member&rsquo;s point about income tax.  The Assembly&rsquo;s priority is to achieve economic growth in Northern Ireland,  and it would be a retrograde step to tax working people. It would be a  considerable setback in our drive to stimulate the economy. However, the  Scottish Executive intend to move in that direction, and I have indicated that  my Department will watch their experience to see whether any lessons can be  learned.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  Although the Minister touched on the answer to my question in his response to a  previous one, the answer must be clarified for some Members of the House. The  Minister will be aware that, in the past few  weeks, a member of the SDLP who is also a member of the Finance and  Personnel Committee has been scaremongering,  saying that the Department was con&shy;sidering the introduction of rating  for agricultural land.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That led to real concerns in the rural communities that I  represent. I am not sure whether that Member was misinformed or misled. For the  benefit of Mr O&rsquo;Loan, I ask the Minister to once more clarify the Department&rsquo;s  position. Is the rating of agricultural land under consideration?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  There is no question of the Department rating agricultural land.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Department has been clear about that matter and has released a public  statement so that there is no doubt about the issue. The only reference to land  in my statement is in respect of derelict areas. In response to Mr Cree&rsquo;s  question, I outlined the type of circumstances that will apply to derelict land,  and I do not believe that any farmers would define agricultural land as  derelict.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Most people would accept that the Minister has achieved a fine balance and a  level of consensus on this matter. That  will be broadly welcomed by the whole House. We particularly strongly  support the incentives for energy-conservation measures, and the capital  valuation limit of &pound;400,000.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I particularly welcome the decision to rate vacant  properties, but why is that measure not proposed to be introduced until April  2009?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I set out some of those reasons in my statement. I am disappointed &mdash; I thought  that the DUP&rsquo;s green Member would have concentrated his question on green  issues and on the incentives that I announced in my statement. However, he has  decided to address another matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The timescale is simply a matter of administrative details  that must be resolved so that the Department is capable of dealing with those  matters. That also allows further time for consultation. It is an  administrative matter, and it is proper that we get that right so that the  Department is able to deal with these matters, rather than going ahead  unprepared and having real difficulties in administering the system thereafter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I too thank the Minister for his statement.  I particularly welcome the rebates for zero-carbon housing and energy  efficiency. I welcome the fact that there will be further consultation on other  green taxes &mdash; that is important.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I was disappointed to hear that the main source of  local taxation will remain property values, which are regressive and not based  on ability to pay. In a motion that the House debated, I suggested that we  consider a land-value tax, which would tax developers who are retaining land  banks and would release more land for housing. Did the Minister consider a  land-value tax, and what were his conclusions?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I welcome the Member&rsquo;s encouragement in  respect of the matters on which I had expected him to ask questions. He  did not let me down.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Unlike me. <em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I am a little confused about Mr Wilson&rsquo;s latter remarks. If he does not  consider that I have addressed the issue of land taxation in dealing with  derelict land, he can only be suggesting that I should have included agricultural  land. He had better have a conversation with the Member for North Antrim Mr  O&rsquo;Loan about that. My statement deals with the vacant land that needs to be  dealt with, and we will do further work on that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I would be happy to  speak to the Member about green issues, if he wishes, over the period of  the consultation.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: A Cheann Comhairle. The Minister has stated how he intends to  engage with the community sector in respect of rate relief. Will he also  clarify how he intends to engage with those  who, for their own &mdash; or for family &mdash; purposes, have had to make  disability adaptations to their homes? Many  people do not claim the rate relief that is available for that. Will the  Minister outline how he intends to engage with that sector?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  By and large, when adaptations are carried out, there should be good records in  the Depart&shy;ment of Health, Social Services and Public Safety; the Housing Executive; or some other body. I will  certainly look at that matter. There is recognition under the existing  system that many adaptations increase the value of a property, and that people  should not be punished on account of their disability. I am happy to consider  finding a way to test the level of uptake from people in those circumstances  and whether a special initiative is required to address that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has arranged to meet today as soon as the House suspends  for lunch. I propose, therefore, by leave of the Assembly, to suspend the  sitting until 2.00 pm.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.25 pm.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic" style="page-break-before:always;">On resuming (Mr  Deputy Speaker <span class="Italic">[Mr Dallat]</span> in the Chair) &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Bill [HL]: <br>
	        &nbsp;Legislative Consent Motion</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The next item of business is the Executive Committee&rsquo;s legislative  consent motion relating to the Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Bill  [HL].</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly agrees that the provisions in the Dormant  Bank and Building Society Accounts Bill relating to the distribution in Northern Ireland  of sums released from dormant bank and building society accounts should be  considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have tabled the motion to seek the Assembly&rsquo;s agreement  to the inclusion of Northern    Ireland in the provisions of a Westminster  Bill that aims to release millions of pounds from inactive bank and building society accounts and reinvest them in local  communities. Alongside that, the rights of customers to reclaim their  money, at any time, will be preserved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The scheme was first announced formally in the Chancellor&rsquo;s  2005 pre-Budget report. Since then, discussions have taken place with the  banking industry, followed by two UK-wide public consultations. That has  culminated in the Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Bill [HL], which  was introduced in the House of Lords on 7 November 2007.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Banking and financial services is a reserved matter, and  therefore the Assembly could not legislate on this issue. However, in keeping with the spirit of devolution,  provision has been made in the Bill for the three devolved Administrations to  set the priorities for distribution in their respective jurisdictions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Bill proposes to give the Department of Finance and Personnel new executive functions and  the power to make an Order setting the spending priorities for  distribution in Northern    Ireland, the consent of the Assembly is  required.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill defines dormant accounts as those that have had no  customer-initiated activity for a period of 15 years. It is anticipated that  dormant accounts could initially amount to more than &pound;500 million across the UK, with tens  of millions of pounds recurring annually thereafter. Northern Ireland will benefit  alongside the other UK Administrations, on a population basis. Initially,  additional resources have been estimated at between &pound;10 million and &pound;20  million, with hundreds of thousands of pounds each year thereafter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In preparation for the  commencement of the scheme, financial  institutions have already begun a comprehensive exercise to make every  effort to reunite customers with their assets. Members may have already noticed  advertisements in the local press to that effect. The assets identified in dormant accounts will be transferred by  banks and building societies to a reclaim fund. That fund will be independent  of the Government and the banking industry, and will be regulated by the  Financial Services Authority.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It will be the duty of the reclaim fund to retain and  invest a prudent portion of the assets in order to meet any future repayment  claims from customers. That is a key point, and it will ensure that customers  will be able to reclaim funds transferred to the scheme at any time. Assets not needed to meet the reclaim risk, or  reasonable running costs, will be released for distribution.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In light of its UK-wide infrastructure, its experience in  distribution and the efficiency benefits that that brings, the legislation  names the Big Lottery Fund as the vehicle for distributing funds throughout the  UK.  I recognise the valid concerns that many in  our community will have about that approach, and I have made strong representations to the Treasury on that basis. In  response, the Treasury has assured me that all scheme resources  represent a separate and distinct funding stream from lottery funding. Distinct  branding will be used for all projects funded through the scheme. That approach  will ensure that all projects funded from the scheme will have no links with  the proceeds of gambling.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I emphasise that the  funds will not form part of public spending. The only influence that the  Executive will have on the scheme, following the passing of enabling legislation, will be in setting the local  priorities for spend and in issuing directions to the distribution body.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As this money belongs to customers &mdash; albeit unclaimed by  them &mdash; it sits within the banking sector. Therefore, it would not be  appropriate for Government to seize it and spend it directly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As for the priorities to benefit from these assets, the  Bill provides a general definition of &ldquo;social or environmental purposes&rdquo; on  which unclaimed assets may be spent. It is within that overarching theme that  the Assembly will be able to set its own spending priorities in Northern Ireland,  and those priorities will be reflected in the directions given to the Big  Lottery Fund for distribution here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If Members agree the legislative consent motion before them  today, I will undertake a consultation in early 2008 on the Northern Ireland  spending priorities. I will then bring proposals to the Executive and Assembly  for agreement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The dormant accounts scheme has the potential to deliver  real benefits to communities across Northern Ireland by freeing up  resources that are lying idle in dormant accounts and reinvesting them in needy  communities. Should the Assembly give its consent to the Bill&rsquo;s provisions, it will have an excellent opportunity to  set the priorities for spending Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s share of the proceeds. The Executive  approved the legislation at a meeting on 8 November, and I now invite Members  to do the same.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr Storey)</strong>: As the  Minister has already explained, the Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts  Bill [HL] is going through West&shy;minster, and Northern Ireland  in included in the legislation. The Bill deals with the reserved matter of  financial services, and it is the Committee&rsquo;s under&shy;standing that, in the  spirit of devolution, the UK Government decided to make provision in the Bill  for the devolved Administrations to set spending priorities and to have some  input into the distribution of moneys in their jurisdictions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly&rsquo;s consent is required in order for Northern Ireland  to be included in the legislation, in so far as the Bill contains provisions  that confer new executive functions on the Department of Finance and Personnel.  As the Minister has explained, the Depart&shy;ment will have the power to make  Orders that identify the spending areas in which the Big Lottery Fund may  distribute funds from the unclaimed assets of dormant bank and building society  accounts that are apportioned to Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Finance and Personnel held two separate  evidence sessions on the Bill with DFP officials, including the principal legal  officer in the Departmental Solicitor&rsquo;s Office. Those meetings were recorded by  Hansard, and the Committee decided to publish the minutes of evidence on the  Assembly website to ensure that the details of its deliberations were available  to the wider body of MLAs and other stakeholders. The Department also provided  Committee members with copies of the draft Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the first evidence session on 24 October, Committee  members raised a range of issues. These included: the consequences should the  Assembly not give its legislative consent; how the alternative scheme for  smaller banks and building societies would operate; the risk of reclaim, and  the process involved; ethical concerns over the use of the Big Lottery Fund as  the distribution vehicle and as a barrier to applications for funding; measures  to ensure that spend goes to worthwhile projects; and the reasons why dormant  accounts could not be allocated directly to devolved Administrations for distribution.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee raised those issues formally with the  Department and received a substantive written reply. A further evidence session  was held with DFP officials on 7 November, after which the Committee was  content that the Department had adequately addressed its specific concerns.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the key question of what the consequences would be were  the Assembly not to give its legislative consent to the legislation, the  Department advised the Committee that it was likely that the UK Government  would still proceed with it as planned, given that financial services is a  reserved matter. The Bill would be amended, removing the provisions that confer  on DFP the functions of setting the Northern   Ireland priorities for spend and giving directions to the  Northern Ireland  committee of the Big Lottery Fund.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, while the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish  Parliament would have the power to set out particular spending areas for the  money apportioned to them, the Northern Ireland Assembly would not. We would be  missing an opportunity to influence the spending priorities for Northern Ireland  and to give directions to the Big Lottery Fund. In addition, the voluntary and  community sector in Northern    Ireland would be unable to feed its views  into the local consultation process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In general terms, therefore, while the Committee has  reservations about the Bill, including the bureaucracy associated with some of  its provisions, Members agreed that a pragmatic approach is required so that Northern Ireland  does not lose out significantly. Consequently, the Committee agreed unanimously  on 7 November to support the Department of Finance and Personnel in seeking the  Assembly&rsquo;s endorsement of the principle of the extension of the provisions of  the Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Bill to Northern Ireland.  I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Deputy  Chairperson of the Finance <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">Committee has  fully set out the Committee&rsquo;s deliberations</span>; I am speaking in a personal  capacity as a member of Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion. The Bill is a pragmatic response to  the issue of funds that are lying dormant in the reserves of the banking  institutions in this state. Its provisions will empower the application of  those dormant funds to very important projects that the Executive and, indeed,  this Assembly would wish to see addressed. The fact that these funds are  benefiting no-one in any particular way is an issue that has been unaddressed  for a considerable period of time. There is some comparative experience in the  measures that have been adopted South of the border, and it has been seen that,  particularly in regard to the social agenda, these funds can be applied where  funding might not otherwise be available.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to acknowledge the small number of  financial institutions that trade solely in this state. They will have the  power under this legislation, having taken the proper steps to identify the  funding as being in dormant accounts to which there is no immediate claim, to  apply it in the areas in which they trade. One or two examples of institutions  that trade solely in particular locations have been made known in the  background research. In Derry city, for  example, where I live, there is one such institution. Funds that are released  by this mechanism can and will be applied by that institution in its immediate  location. Again, that is to the good.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All in all, the concerns that people have about the  procedural difficulties can be legally proofed. We can revisit the arrangements  if they prove to be inadequate. At this stage, no one can quantify the sums of  money involved. They might be considerable, or they might not. However, the question will at least have been  answered, and a mechanism devised by which they can be applied to the  greater good, rather than lying dormant and obsolete. I strongly endorse the  motion and commend it to the House.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I support the motion. This is an advantage to the public  purse. Good can be done through these resources being made available. It also  works for the banks by removing liabilities from their books. I have little to  add to the comments of the last two Members, but I do have a couple of points.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">First of all, this type of procedure is fairly common internationally. Mr McLaughlin referred to the  experience of the Republic   of Ireland, and there are  many other international examples. This is not something new or sinister that  is being put forward by the Government.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, one small concern is that resources are to be  redistributed to the devolved regions of the UK on the basis of population, as  opposed to need and &mdash; as we are all aware &mdash; resources from the block grant are  allocated by need, rather than by population. Although I appreciate that the sums  involved may be relatively small in comparison with our overall block grant, it  is important that that point be made to the Treasury, and that we preserve a  needs-based approach to financing. There may be some financial implications for  Northern Ireland  as a consequence of the change in approach to that formula.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A further important  point is that the money in dormant accounts belongs to people. The  account holder may, sadly, have passed away. Equally, however, the bank may not  be able to contect them because they have changed address. It is important that  the process for someone who wishes to reclaim his or her funds be as simple as  possible, and no more complicated than withdrawing money from any account,  albeit that the money will have been transferred to a central fund.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those points notwithstanding, I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I support the motion, although I am not overly enamoured or enthusiastic about  some of the principles underlying the Bill. Some of my Finance and Personnel  Committee colleagues and I have expressed  our unease at the idea of the Treasury emptying anyone&rsquo;s bank or  building society account. It seems that the of raiding bank accounts has taken  a different tack to the one that Northern Ireland has until now, from time to  time, experienced.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that there is a reclaim fund and that,  although the money may have been taken and spent, people can still get their  money back. The principle that people&rsquo;s money remains their own is important,  regardless of whether activity was last initiated 15 years previously.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On balance, it is best that Northern   Ireland be included in the provisions of the Bill as it  progresses through its various stages at Westminster. It is  important that Northern    Ireland and the Executive have the  opportunity to influence what types of social and environmental purposes are  funded. We must set those priorities for ourselves and in our own interests,  rather than have a direct-rule-style diktat to tell us what is best for us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to reiterate concerns that I have raised in Committee, and which have been expressed by the  Minister, about the body that it is envisaged will distribute any funds  that are raised. Members will be well aware of the genuine and deeply held  concerns of many individuals, as well as of some Church and community  organisations, about dealing with the Big Lottery Fund. I know that the purpose  of the Big Lottery Fund is only to manage money; however, impressions are  important.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I encourage the Minister to continue his discussions with  the Treasury to ensure that the branding of the distribution fund is distinct,  and that it is made clear that it is not lottery money, thus making it easier  for those who are concerned about using the proceeds of gambling to apply for  the money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to take  a realistic, pragmatic approach. I  ask the Minister, in his summation, to elaborate on the possible consequences for Northern Ireland  if the legis&shy;lative consent motion were not passed, and if we were not  included in the provisions of the Westminster Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Like my colleague Mitchel  McLaughlin, I support the motion, which provides a legal framework to allow  assets from accounts that have lain dormant for at least 15 years to be  distributed to community causes through the Big Lottery Fund.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many bank and building society accounts lie dormant and  unclaimed, often because the account holder has died, or because surviving  relatives have expressed no claim. Several countries operate similar schemes  whereby moneys from such accounts are reinvested in the community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill has already  become law in England, Scotland and Wales, and there is similar  legislation in the South of Ireland. Although social and environmental themes  are the main priorities, individual regions can decide for themselves to what causes assets will be distributed. The  Bill will allow for money in dormant accounts to be transferred to a reclaim  fund. That means that any individual, or any individual&rsquo;s relatives who are  still living, can &mdash; should they wish to do so &mdash; make a claim from that fund for  the return of that money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An alternative scheme is available for smaller banks and  building societies allowing them to transfer an agreed proportion of a dormant  account into a reclaim fund and to distribute the remainder to charities that  benefit the local community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to reiterate Members&rsquo; concerns about certain aspects  of the legislation, which I share. These moneys should be additional to lottery  funding and should not affect lottery distribution. They must also be separate  from departmental funding. A number of safeguards must be implemented so that  an individual or a living relative can reclaim the moneys at any time and that  banks do not simply wait for owners to come to them but are proactive in  seeking the whereabouts of those owners.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In order for accounts&rsquo; assets to be distributed equally and  fairly, and in a way that is accessible to all community and voluntary  organisations, safeguards should be put in  place so that local priorities can dictate where the money goes. It is important that the community and  voluntary sector is involved in any consultation on how that distribution of  assets is progressed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members have said, the moneys would be much better  put to use in the community than lying dormant in bank accounts. Therefore, I  support the motion. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Like other Members, I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When this issue was first brought to the Committee for  Finance and Personnel, other members and I had certain reservations, to which I  will refer. However, those reservations have now been dealt with, thanks to the  Department and the Minister&rsquo;s assurances.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I found the concept of the Government&rsquo;s raiding private individuals&rsquo; bank accounts somewhat  distasteful; it seemed to be a typical Treasury wheeze to extract  additional money. Nevertheless, there are counter-arguments that point to these  measures being necessary. From a philosophical viewpoint, the legislation  resembles a latter-day updated version of the parable of the talents, in which  an owner who has buried, or neglected, money is punished by having that money  used for the common good. Similarly, moneys realised via legislation governing  dormant accounts will be distributed in a way that benefits good causes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Had Northern    Ireland decided to exempt itself from this  legislation, it is clear that, in a best-case scenario, the resulting  procedures might not have suited us. If the Assembly negatives the motion, the  worst-case scenario would be that we run the risk of simply being excluded  completely. The amounts of money that will flow into Northern Ireland will be relatively  limited, but they will benefit us overall. Therefore, from a practical point of  view, Northern Ireland  must be included in the scheme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was concerned that the intention was to operate the  scheme through the National Lottery in the rest of the United    Kingdom. Therefore, I am glad that the Minister has assured Members that the scheme will be administered in Northern Ireland separately from  the National Lottery. When the Minister makes his winding-up speech, it  might be worthwhile if he would outline how the scheme would be administered  here if Northern Ireland were to be excluded from the legislation, or if, for some reason, the Assembly were to negative the  motion. Christian and charitable organisations have problems with  National Lottery funding that would preclude them from benefiting from the  dormant accounts scheme, so I would welcome the Minister&rsquo;s assurances today that the scheme will be marketed and  administered differently in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I had concerns about people being deprived of their hard-earned savings, albeit savings that had lain  dormant for quite some time. Members have been assured that there will  be a consolidated fund, so that if claims are made at any stage, they will be  honoured and people will get their money back.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the basis of those  assurances, and from a practical viewpoint, Northern Ireland will benefit as a  result of the measure. Therefore, I support the proposal.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  support the motion. Dormant accounts are an interesting phenomenon, which many  of us will never come across. Nevertheless, accounts can lie dormant in  building societies for many years and for various reasons &mdash; perhaps when an  individual dies his or her family may not be aware of additional accounts, or  perhaps people have stashed unauthorised funds in accounts. If the accounts remain dormant for a significant period  &mdash; that is, many years &mdash; the one group that benefits is the banks. Why should  banks benefit from money in accounts of which the owners have passed on or  cannot be identified? Therefore, I understand the reasoning behind the proposal  in the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that there is sufficient protection for  those who, at a late stage, are identified as account owners. I am content that  there will be a totally independent fund, which will be able to secure payment  in that case. The proposal makes sense; it is better that local people, instead  of politicians in London,  have an input in setting local priorities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the Committee, I  raised the view that there should be a separation between this fund and  any other funds in the Big Lottery, and that it should be identified as  separate from gambling. Other Members supported that view, and I hope that that  will help the Minister&rsquo;s attempts to achieve that goal. I have come across many  worthy groups in the community &mdash; such as the  YMCA, which does good work,  particularly with young people&mdash; that have been unable to apply for Big  Lottery funding, which they would have been successful in obtaining, because of  their beliefs. Any measure that increases the opportunity for such  organisations to gain funding and improve their work in the community must be  supported. I urge the Minister to ensure that &mdash; as far as possible &mdash; a separate  fund exists, and that it is clearly identified as such. The many groups that  have not felt able to apply for funding will then be able to do so in the  future.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  state my wholehearted support for the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I am pleased that Members have had a useful &mdash; albeit short &mdash; debate on the  issue that the provisions in the Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts  Bill [HL] relating to Northern    Ireland should be considered by the UK  Parliament. A number of important points were raised and I will do my best to  mention as many of them as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the Chairperson of the Committee for Finance  and Personnel, and his colleague, that the fund must be used in the community  and must not be seen as a way for the Government to replace its funding. There  were problems with additionality in Europe,  and we will not go down that road. This is, genuinely, money to help our  communities under the broad heading of social and environmental purposes. If the  motion is passed, it will be up to the Executive to be more precise about the  direction of the fund.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members mentioned the ethical issues involved. When  I was first contacted by HM Treasury on the matter, I wrote back and prompted a  stream of correspondence on the issue. I was pleased that &mdash; when the Bill was  in its final state of preparation &mdash; the  Treasury made it clear in its response that unclaimed assets would be kept separate from lottery  resources, with their own distinct branding and financial management  arrangements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">HM Treasury saw that as a key principle.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Like many Members, I have faced circumstances in which  communities were in great need but for ethical reasons I was not prepared to  draw on lottery funds to ease that need. The dormant accounts scheme will allow  those communities to benefit from our being able to give directions to the Big  Lottery Fund, and I hope that many of them will do so. However, there will be  no plaque on the wall to the Big Lottery Fund should people avail themselves of  the scheme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was also asked about the consequences were the Assembly  not to agree to the legislative consent motion. I do not get the impression  from the Members to whom I have spoken that that will be the case, but, lest  Members be teetering between decisions, I must inform them that the Treasury  would still give the money to Northern Ireland, but it would be likely that the  Big Lottery Fund would determine the funding priorities rather than their being  set by the Executive and the Assembly. Therefore, those of us who want to see  less of a role for the Big Lottery Fund will want to ensure that we proceed  positively.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry made a point about the risk of reclaim &mdash; he has  gone. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: He  is away to change his bank accounts.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  They will all have gone dormant.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As some of my colleagues did, he referred to the risk  involved for those people who, for whatever reason, have dormant bank accounts.  They might have changed address or might not have needed the money for 15 years.  Those people will be able to go as normal to their bank, where a fund will have  been set up to ensure that they do not lose their assets.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of a population-based share as opposed to a  needs-based share was also raised. The Scottish and Northern Ireland Executives  and the Welsh Assembly Government all took the same view &mdash; that a different  formula should be used. However, financial services is a reserved matter, and  the Treasury has not accepted that view. Some of our colleagues in the House of  Lords and the House of Commons may attempt to table  an amendment to the Bill. Nevertheless, any amendment would be Barnett  formula-based, missing out some of our community&rsquo;s needs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I say to my ever-sceptical friend, Mr Hamilton, that this is not a case of the Treasury&rsquo;s emptying  bank accounts; the Treasury will not be emptying anyone&rsquo;s bank account.  The banks will operate the dormant accounts scheme voluntarily, so the Treasury  will not get its hands on the money at all.  The scheme will be operated independently, and the only Government role  will be that that the devolved Administrations and central Government play in  setting the spending priorities that are to be given to the Big Lottery Fund to  allow it to distribute the funds.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are the issues that were raised during the debate,  and I hope that I have not left anything out. I thank Members for their  constructive contributions. It has been an interesting debate that will inform  the setting of the scheme&rsquo;s spending priorities in Northern Ireland and the direction  that will eventually be issued to the fund distributor.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The dormant accounts scheme provides the mechanism to  remove dormant accounts from the balance sheets of banks and building  societies, and to reinvest them back into our local communities. If the House  gives its consent to the motion today, that will open the door to an excellent  opportunity for the Assembly to set priorities for distribution and to ensure  spend goes to worthwhile projects across Northern Ireland. If that consent  is not given, it will be a missed opportunity to set the spending priorities  for our jurisdiction. Therefore, I encourage Members to support the motion.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly agrees that the provisions in the  Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Bill relating to the distribution in  Northern Ireland of sums released from dormant bank and building society  accounts should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
          <p class="H3SectionHeading" style="page-break-before:always;"><a name="5"></a>Committee Business</p>
          <p class="H4StageHeading">Reports of the &nbsp;Comptroller  and Auditor General</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Public Accounts Committee (Mr O&rsquo;Dowd)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly orders that any report by the Comptroller  and Auditor General, which has been prepared under Article 8 of the Audit (NI)  Order 1987 for presentation to the Northern Ireland Assembly in accordance with  Article 11 of that Order, be printed and published under the authority of the  Assembly.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The motion addresses the issue of privilege of the  Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s reports. Until devolution, all his  publications were ordered to be published by the Westminster Parliament and  were, therefore, privileged. That clearly represents good <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">practice in public-sector audit, as it allows the  Comptroller</span> and Auditor General to give a full and complete report of  his findings to the legislature.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">To date, most of the main reports, which the Public  Accounts Committee has taken evidence on and reported, have been fully covered  by privilege, as they <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">were published by  order of the Westminster Parliament</span>. It would have been difficult to  bring several of those reports to the Committee without that status. Indeed,  there are a number of Northern Ireland Audit Office reports that deal with  potentially controversial issues, and it is important that those should be  published with the authority of the Assembly.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In light of that, I am sure that Members will agree that it is important that we ensure  that the arrange&shy;ments for audit and accountability under the Assembly  are at least as robust as those that existed under direct rule.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In due course, consideration will be given to reflecting  the arrangement in Standing Orders or, if an opportunity arises, in  legislation. However, until such times, this motion will provide the  Comptroller and Auditor General with the necessary privilege &mdash; subject to the  Assembly&rsquo;s resolution today &mdash; to publish all future reports and, through that  process, to ensure that we receive the quality of information from the auditors  that is necessary to carry out our work.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I, therefore, commend the motion to the House.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: If  the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee are to be  able to carry out their work, this motion will be an essential part of the  process. I support the motion.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  I apologise. I should have called Mr Robin Newton first.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Audit Committee (Mr Newton)</strong>: As Chairperson of the Audit Committee,  I support the motion. Members will understand that there has been some concern  in the Audit Committee on the matter. The Committee discussed the issue in some  detail at its meeting on 7 November 2007. The Committee  is also of the opinion that absolute privilege is an essential  requirement so that the Northern Ireland Audit Office can carry out its  functions completely.</p>
          <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Audit Committee members expressed their concern at the  meeting on 7 November that the Comptroller and Auditor General does not have  the same powers as his counterparts in Westminster  and Wales.  The <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">Committee believes that it is  fundamental to the practice</span> of public audit that the Assembly&rsquo;s auditor  should be able to present all significant and relevant findings to the Assembly  without the threat of legal challenge from third parties involved in the report  issues.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is also characteristic of good custom and practice that  all facts are reported and are freely available to the legislature and the  general public. This motion will permit the Assembly to order that the reports  of the Northern Ireland Audit Office are  printed and published, <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">therefore  extending absolute privilege to the Comptroller</span> and Auditor General. I,  therefore, commend the motion to the House.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call Mr Trevor Lunn. I call Mr Simon Hamilton.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  That was the shortest speech on record &mdash; I hope that mine is not the longest.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion.  The Public Accounts Committee is  essential to the Assembly, if it is not always welcomed by those who  come before it from time to time. The Committee has been extremely active in  the past; and its work plan until the end of the year and for next year  confirms that. The Committee is starting to set its own agenda and to look at  its own issues, such as the situation in the Northern Ireland Events Company,  which is currently in the news. The Committee will examine that matter in time,  and it is essential that that good work is not hampered by loss of privilege.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Not having the ability to publish reports under the  authority of the Assembly would seriously impede the work of the Comptroller  and Auditor General and, by extension, the work of the Public Accounts  Committee.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Public Accounts Committee having that privilege rightly  keeps the Assembly in line with its counterparts in England  and Wales  and, in the long term, I hope that such situations might be addressed by  legislation or Standing Orders. However, in the interim, I fully support the  motion as it stands.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly orders that any report by the Comptroller  and Auditor General, which has been prepared under Article (8) of the Audit  (NI) Order 1987 for presentation to the Northern Ireland Assembly in accordance  with Article 11 of that Order, be printed and published under the authority of  the Assembly.</p>
          <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="6"></a>Draft Budget</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to four hours and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 15 minutes to propose and 20  minutes to make a winding-up speech. The Minister will have 45 minutes to  respond, and all other Members who are called to speak will have 10 minutes.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I advise Members that although two amendments have been  published on the Marshalled List, after taking  advice, and taking account of practice elsewhere, and guidance in  Erskine May, I have reconsidered and, at my request, the two amendments have  been withdrawn under Standing Order 15(5). I am grateful to the Members  concerned for their agreement to withdraw those amendments.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, my ruling is that, in future, I shall not select  amendments to any take-note motion.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr Storey)</strong>: I welcome the debate because it provides Members with the  opportunity &mdash; both as representatives of Statutory Committees, and  individually &mdash; to set out what they perceive to be the significant budgetary  issues that face each Depart&shy;ment in relation to the maintenance, improvement  and delivery of front line public services. The themes that emerge from the  debate will be beneficial in informing the Committee&rsquo;s forthcoming co-ordinated  report on the draft Budget, which will, in  turn, allow the Assembly to influence the Executive as they finalise the  Budget.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">On 25 October 2007, the Minister of Finance and Personnel  presented the Executive&rsquo;s first draft Budget. In his speech, the Finance  Minister emphasised that the primary focus of the draft Budget is on economic  growth, and that that clearly indicates the Executive&rsquo;s long-term commitment to  building a better future for the people of Northern Ireland. That focus aligns  with the priorities that are identified in the Executive&rsquo;s draft Programme for  Government, which are to grow a dynamic, innovative economy; to promote  tolerance, inclusion, health and well-being; to invest to build in  infrastructure; to deliver modern, high-quality and efficient public services;  and to protect and enhance our environment and natural resources.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In presenting the draft Budget, the Minister also  highlighted increased public expectations of public services and the need not  just to spend more, but to achieve value for money for every pound we spend.  Therefore, the Budget period from 2008 to 2011 presents a challenge for the  Executive &mdash; and, indeed, every Member of the Assembly &mdash; to prove that  devolution can make a real difference to people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We must recognise the  context in which that challenge must be met. The outcome of the 2007  comprehensive spending review means that, in the UK, public expenditure is set to  grow at the slowest rate since that mechanism was introduced in 1998. The  Chancellor&rsquo;s comprehensive spending review  announcement indicated that the Northern Ireland departmental  expenditure limit would increase, in real terms, by an average of 1&middot;7% per  annum over the next three years. However, in his statement on 25 October, the  Minister explained that, following necessary adjustments, a more accurate  figure for real-terms growth in Northern Ireland expenditure over the next  three years would be an average of 1&middot;2% per annum.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The reduced rate of growth in public expenditure across the  UK  means that there is a greater emphasis on efficiency and value for money. The  Executive&rsquo;s draft Budget contains a target for Departments to deliver  cash-releasing efficiency savings of &pound;793 million by 2010-11. The efficiency  drive and future progress by Departments in achieving the targets will exercise  the departmental scrutiny Committees and Assembly Members in general.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In commissioning the views of the other Statutory  Committees, the Committee for Finance and Personnel has suggested themes and issues, which, though neither prescriptive nor exhaustive, aim to assist the  Committees in gathering evidence from  their respective Departments and in scrutinising their submissions. The  responses will include each Committee&rsquo;s  views on its Department&rsquo;s spending priorities in the context of the  draft Budget allocation. Other suggested  issues include any evidence-based arguments for additions to the  allocations in the Department&rsquo;s draft Budget; any risks from existing  efficiency plans; and any scope for achieving additional  cash-releasing efficiencies or future disposals of excess assets to  support front line services and strategic spending priorities.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">My Committee is due to receive the responses from the other Committees shortly, and they will be  included in our report, which will inform the Executive&rsquo;s deliberations  on the draft Budget in preparation for a substantive Assembly debate on the  revised Budget in January 2008.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to setting out the positions of each Statutory  Committee, the report will examine a range of strategic and cross-cutting  issues. I have already mentioned efficiency savings, but other issues will  require consideration and monitoring. Not least of those is the financial  management agenda, which the Department of Finance and Personnel will pursue  aggressively over the Budget period, including the related issues of  overcommitment, underspend and financial forecasting and monitoring by  Departments.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">The approach of planned  overcommitment &mdash; whereby</span> more money is allocated to spending programmes  before the start of the year than is actually available &mdash; helps to reduce  underspend by anticipating average levels of reduced requirements and adjusting  the total level of resources allocated to programmes accordingly. However, it  has been recognised that that approach reduces in-year flexibility and the  capacity to respond to in-year unforeseen pressures. Accordingly, the Minister  announced the planned year-on-year reduction in overcommitment, from the  present figure of &pound;153 million to &pound;100 million in 2008-09, &pound;80 million in  2009-10 and &pound;60 million in 2010-11.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The move to reduce  overcommitment must, however, be accompanied by an improvement in the  level of financial management in the Northern Ireland Civil Service to ensure  that we eradicate the culture of underspend. The Committee has noted that, in  the period from 2003-04 to 2005-06, approximately 1% to 2% of revenue budgets  across the Northern Ireland  block remained unused at the year end. That  represented between &pound;113 million and &pound;150 million per annum. In the same  period, between 15% and 20% of capital budgets remained unused, amounting to  between &pound;170 million and &pound;230 million.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee acknowledges that the Department is taking  steps to develop financial-management skills and to improve financial processes  across the Civil Service. As part of that initiative, the Department of Finance and Personnel commissioned an external  review of forecasting and monitoring from PKF consultants, a report on  which was published in June 2007. The overriding finding from the report was  that insufficient priority was afforded to forecasting and monitoring. It also  highlighted the fact that the average figures for underspend failed to reflect  the variance across Departments.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Finance and Personnel will monitor the  implementation of the recommendations from that review. More generally, all the  Statutory Committees will have an important role to play in scrutinising their  Departments&rsquo; in-year spend by examining each  quarterly monitoring round to minimise underspend.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">A further cross-cutting theme in the draft Budget is the  reform agenda, which DFP will have a key role in co-ordinating. The Civil  Service reform projects and programmes are expected to realise a range of  benefits and value-for-money savings across  the 11 Departments. Those  benefits will be measured using a series of key performance indicators, which  will be integrated with departmental business planning. Again, there will be an  important role for each Statutory Committee in monitoring the progress of the  various reform projects in the respective Departments.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for  Finance and Personnel has already produced a report on Workplace 2010,  and will continue to scrutinise the future progress and direction of that major  accommodation project, which will affect all Departments and is expected to  generate approx&shy;imately &pound;175 million in capital receipts during the Budget  period. Other key reform projects for which DFP has lead responsibility include  NI Direct, which will ultimately provide a single telephone point of contact  for public services, and the various shared service centres, including HR  Connect, Account NI and Records NI.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Other cross-cutting developments that require consideration  include the creation of a performance and efficiency delivery unit and a  capital realisation task force. The performance and efficiency delivery unit  will be tasked with identifying the scope for generating additional  cash-releasing efficiencies and improving  delivery and performance within Departments and across the wider public  sector. The Committee for Finance and Personnel will be examining the role and  functions of that unit, including the targets and reporting mechanisms that  will be implemented to measure its performance.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The capital realisation task force is to make  recommendations that remove barriers to a more efficient and economically  effective use of the asset base, and realising additional resources through the  disposal of surplus or underutilised assets. A report is due from the task  force in early December, and will inform the final Budget and investment  strategy. The Committee for Finance and Personnel will focus on the work of the  task force as it affects the capital allocations in the three financial years  covered in the Budget period.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">A further strategic issue for consideration is the  budgetary impact of the rating reforms, including the domestic rating reforms  that were announced today by the Minister of Finance and Personnel, and the  decision regarding industrial derating. Other cross-cutting issues include the  role of PFI and borrowing during the budget period; anticipated savings on  procurement spend by Departments; the potential costs and efficiencies from the review of public administration; and  the strategic debate around the Barnett formula and needs assessment.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee will also  be interested in the outcome of the wider public consultation on the  draft Budget. The Department has advised that four public meetings will be held  &mdash; one each in Belfast, Enniskillen, Londonderry  and Armagh. In addition, regarding the  voluntary and community sector, the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action will be holding a separate event that DFP officials will attend to facilitate  the debate.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Department will  also be holding a range of other meetings with social and economic  partners, including the Confederation of British Industry and the Northern  Ireland Committee, Irish Congress of Trade Unions. I expect that all Members  will be keen for the Executive to take account of the views of key stakeholder  groups and of the general public before finalising the Budget.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I shall now turn briefly to the Department of Finance and  Personnel&rsquo;s own draft budget allocations. Regarding  current expenditure, the draft Budget 2008-11 prescribes a significant  reduction in the share of departmental expenditure limit funds allocated to  DFP. The Department has suffered a large cut &mdash; the current year&rsquo;s allocation is  17&middot;1% lower than that for 2006-07, and that trend will continue in subsequent  years.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has focused in particular on the Department&rsquo;s  proposed capital expenditure in the draft Budget. DFP bid for approximately  &pound;94&middot;2 million over the three financial years 2008-11 and was allocated &pound;68&middot;7 million.  The Committee has queried the potential impact  that that reduced allocation may have on delivery, and how DFP plans to  manage with an allocation significantly below the amount sought.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In particular, the Committee is concerned about whether the  capital allocations for Land and Property Services will be sufficient to allow  the organisation to alleviate difficulties with its IT system, especially with regard to rate relief. In addition, the decision  announced by the Minister earlier today to introduce rating on vacant  domestic property will place a heavy burden on Land and Property Services,  which will have to develop the necessary databases. The Committee will pursue  the issue with the Department of Finance and Personnel to ensure that any  future funding require&shy;ments arising from rating reform can be met in any  revised allocations.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I now return to the wider, strategic context. The draft  Budget is clearly connected to, and driven by, the priorities set out in the draft Programme for Government and the  draft investment strategy, which the Assembly debated yesterday. In addition,  however, there are a number of underlying themes and assumptions on which the  Budget allocations are based. I have high&shy;lighted, in particular, the entire  financial management agenda, together with a drive to reform the public sector  in order to deliver the value-for-money and efficiency targets that will enable  improvements to be made to front line services, which the people of Northern Ireland  deserve.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Those areas will require ongoing monitoring and scrutiny by  the Committee for Finance and Personnel, together with the other Statutory  Committees and the Assembly, over the next three financial years of the Budget  period.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to hearing Members&rsquo; contributions, and I  welcome the opportunity for an extended debate on the draft Budget.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom labhairt le taca&iacute;ocht a  thabhairt don r&uacute;n. Yesterday, I congratulated the Office of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister on the draft  Programme for Government and spoke about how ISNI 2 had the potential to  deliver on the programme&rsquo;s priorities of addressing inequality through  targeting marginalised sectors.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Today, the House considers the draft Budget, which  constitutes the nuts and bolts of how those targets will be achieved. That task  faces us all, and the challenge is huge.  The facts speak for themselves. Tackling inequality and lifting the boat  of the vulnerable means that at least some of the following facts must be  addressed: 31% of 16- to 60-year-olds lack paid work; 22% of the workforce is  low paid; nearly 25% of households are unable to afford adequate home heating;  nearly 100,000 children and 50,000 pensioners are living in income poverty; and  there are 3,000 premature deaths each year because of disadvantage and poverty.  Those facts are shocking.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The solution is simple: reality &mdash; that is, current economic  patterns &mdash; has to change. It is the task of all MLAs to ensure that that is  done. Today, every Member should be asking how that will be achieved. This is,  after all, a legacy Budget, and in that context we need to see ministerial  leadership and initiative.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will take the example  of fuel poverty. The Assembly has had two debates on that subject and a  guarantee that Government will work to eradicate fuel poverty in vulnerable  households by 2010 and in households that are not considered vulnerable by  2016. Yesterday, however, we were faced with the headline that the Minister for  Social Development intends to cut &pound;10 million &mdash; 50% of the current allocation &mdash;  from the warm homes schemes.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Within the confines of the block Budget from Westminster, the Minister  for Social Development, like all Ministers, has to make choices. The question  must be asked whether she has made the right choice. Has she the political will  and skill to prevent that cut? For instance, has she considered the land banks  in her Department&rsquo;s estate? She has to pay for them annually, but if they were  utilised more effectively, they could fund social and affordable housing and  contribute to combating fuel poverty.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minster of Agriculture and Rural Development, Michelle  Gildernew, was required to do that to deal with inescapable pressures. Stand Up  for Derry is seeking more social and affordable  housing to address the historical neglect of our city and, indeed, of the  entire north-west region. T&aacute; m&eacute; ag iarraidh tuilleadh infheist&iacute;ochta i nDoire.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I want more housing and investment for Derry, and I  acknowledge the political will and skill shown by the Minister for Regional  Development, Conor Murphy, in respect of the railway decision for Derry and the  north west. I  call on the Minster for Social Development, Margaret Ritchie, to emulate that  type of leadership. It is time for wider ministerial leadership, imagination  and initiative.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In order to address fuel poverty, the workers at the  coalface, all the relevant Departments, and community workers on the ground  must be engaged and involved in tackling the  issue. Places such as Derry, and elsewhere, have dedicated community  workers who know that those who live in fuel poverty experience what that means  in reality, and know how best to eliminate it.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Do Ministers engage  with stakeholders and residents of local communities before deciding on  the choices that they face? I wonder.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is the job of local officials and administrators to contact people who are living in fuel poverty and  ensure that they be helped to be taken out of it quickly. The market  will not do that; it must be done by supporting groups that work in those  areas. By drilling down and adopting a bottom-up approach, we can work at a  community level, and the task will be manageable. The numbers to be dealt with  are in the tens or hundreds, perhaps, but not 250,000. That is what is known as  the principle of subsidiarity, in EU jargon. That is what good governance and  monitoring is all about: bringing all the stakeholders and networks in the  community together so that they can work to  meet targets, and truly monitor  achievements. They are the people at the coalface; they deal daily with  those who are disadvantaged, and know exactly what it is like to suffer cold  persistently without sufficient money to pay for heating.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Monitoring and measuring our performance is a key part of  delivering our objectives, as is ensuring that equality impact assessments are  fully complied with across the nine categories of the disabled, the elderly, etc. That is not only the correct thing to do, but  represents an intelligent modernising agenda, which is necessary to show  that the North has the political skill and will to tackle disadvantage and participate in the global economy. The  fact that the Executive are beginning to equality-impact assess their spending, and how they are spending limited  finances, is a good-news story to be welcomed at home and abroad.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, buying into social justice, through social requirements and tendering contracts, is a smart  decision that the Executive have  taken, as reflected in the Budget. Joined-up governance will be cemented  as the Minister of Finance and Personnel applies tendering criteria to  procurement agreements, resulting in contractors employing, training and teaching  skills to people who have been registered as long-term unemployed. That represents the use of public money to buy social  justice, which is brilliant.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday&rsquo;s agenda, which left out huge parts of the North,  and large groups of people, is not only out of date, but economically  counterproductive and unstable, and I am  sure that the Minister of Finance and Personnel would agree. It has been  only six months since the transfer of powers, and it will take time to throw  off the shackles direct rule. Of course, Sinn F&eacute;in wants to throw those  shackles off entirely.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The world economic  order is now discussing a sustain&shy;able model of economic development  that integrates social, economic and environmental requirements, rather than  regarding them as burdensome add-ons to a narrow, ineffective economic model  that has produced stagnation and exclusion in our society.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The limitations of this  draft Budget, restricted because we  in the North are controlled by a British Administration that does not care about anyone here, regardless  of one&rsquo;s political opinion, or none, would be assisted greatly by  advancing the intelligent processes that are inherent in the full equality  impact assessment procedure.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The comprehensive spending review results in Ministers making difficult budgetary choices;  they must stand over those choices. They must also use political tactics  and skills &mdash; if they have them &mdash; to achieve deliverables and actually build  prosperity and tackle disadvantage using the Government and governing  opportunities that exist in the current political arrange&shy;ments by linking up  with our counterparts in the Twenty-six Counties. The economic and financial  future of this part of the island will not be resolved in the context of the  Six Counties.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The limitation of the draft Budget should not limit  thinking. Joined-up Government should exist beyond the Assembly, especially,  when it is economically and politically advantageous for all of the people who  reside across the island to have decisions taken that benefit all of us. Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: Sadly, we are faced with difficult choices today, as we discuss the draft Budget and as we  approach the final Budget Bill. Those choices would have been  considerably easier to make if the &pound;1 billion package, which was promised prior  to devolution, had been delivered. However, it was not delivered. Shortly after  that, media focus was switched from the &pound;1 billion package to the Varney Review  and the corporation tax benefits that could flow from that. We still await  them. Where are they, and when will the  review be published? The people of Northern Ireland are entitled to  know the outcome. Will we receive financial benefits from the Varney Review?  Having quashed hopes of a major economic package, with sleight of hand, the  focus was switched elsewhere.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Time has moved on. Now, when we are discussing the draft Budget, problems arise again regarding  difficult funding choices. I cannot help noticing that the lower rate of  corporation tax has not been mentioned by the Minister of Finance and Personnel  in recent months &mdash; I can only assume that good news is not expected on that  subject. A lower rate of corporation tax would have had a major impact on  improving our economic standing and in achieving the objectives set out in the  draft Programme for Government.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of the Committee for Finance and Personnel, I take an interest in financial  matters, generally, and not just in those of the Department of Finance  and Personnel. I would like to know where  the departmental bids have gone. I have tried to get underneath the spin  of the headline figures and the glossy draft Budget with which we were  presented. I have raised the matter with departmental officials and have asked  questions in the Assembly. However, I have not yet received a copy of the bids that were made by each  Department and the outcome of those bids. I am slowly gathering them  from the Committees. However, it is right and proper that Assembly Members  should have that information.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Last week in Committee, I asked departmental officials,  jokingly, whether I had to issue a request under the Freedom of Information Act  to obtain the information. Why is that  information not available? Why is it not published and easily accessible  for everyone to view? Surely, if the public is really being consulted about the  draft Budget, it should be made aware of the bids. They should be put into the  public domain, either through the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; or the Internet.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">People should be made  aware of what was contained in each of the bids and the difficult  choices that have to be made. This is not just about saying that the winning  projects are wonderful; it is about difficult choices; getting the best value  for money, and benefiting our community. I have tabled an Assembly question on  that matter, which is due to be answered today, and I look forward to receiving  that answer. I hope that I do not have to resort to the Freedom of Information  Act: that would be absolutely ridiculous.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We are discussing a  draft Budget: is this a real consult&shy;ation or not? If it is, let us have  the information. That will motivate many people to respond, and the final version of the Budget will be better for it. I  hope that that opportunity is taken.  It is important that people respond to that consultation, but there must  be transparency.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have concerns about several issues in the draft Budget:  first, I will touch briefly on housing. My constituency  work has made me aware of the difficulties faced by those who, although  they are accepted as being homeless, spend a great deal of time on the housing waiting list and are not afforded the  opportunity to remove themselves from  the list. Additional resources are required for housing; if the  Programme for Govern&shy;ment&rsquo;s objectives are  to be achieved, additional moneys will have to be found between now and  the finalised Budget, particularly from the ongoing capital assets review.  Therein lies the potential to release additional funds in the form of unused  public assets to enable the building of more social housing. I hope that that  will be progressed speedily.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Fuel poverty affects a wide range of people, social tenants  and homeowners alike. I recently received correspondence from a natural gas  provider, Firmus Energy, expressing concern  about the possible reduction in  funding for the heating replacement programme next year. A constituent  contacted me some time ago about an open fire in his upstairs flat. That source  of heating was operating at only 28% efficiency, aside from being a health and  fire hazard. It is important that energy-efficiency projects such as the  heating replacement programme and the warm homes scheme, which is also under  threat, are allowed to continue. Fuel poverty must be addressed, and we must  also reduce our carbon emissions.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will turn briefly to the Northern Ireland Children&rsquo;s Commissioner, whose office published a detailed  report in July 2007 in conjunction with OFMDFM and the Department of  Finance and Personnel called &lsquo;An Analysis  of Public Expenditure on Children in Northern Ireland&rsquo;, in which it  stated that children&rsquo;s services in Northern Ireland were 30% underfunded  compared to similar services in the rest of the United Kingdom. The Children&rsquo;s  Commissioner recently commented that the recommendations of the organisation&rsquo;s  report had not been reflected in the draft Budget; in other words, ensuring  that that disparity in funding would continue.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Many other issues, such as speech and language therapy,  statementing processes, after-schools clubs, early intervention, and the  effects on young people at risk that were highlighted in the Bamford Review,  are not being adequately addressed in the draft Budget.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am very passionate about early-years funding. I recently  attended a lecture in Belfast  by Professor James Heckman, a Nobel laureate economist who works with early-years  organisations. He had a simple message &mdash; we must invest in the young. That  makes economic sense, but I am not sure that that is what we are doing. There  is a larger emphasis on structures, but we must invest in people, especially  the very young.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Through my involvement in the Assembly&rsquo;s all-party  children&rsquo;s committee, I have been advised that long-term funding for the Home  Start programme has yet to be secured. Home Start trains and co-ordinates  volunteers and assists families who need help. Without Home Start, many  children would have a poorer start in life, and some might even have ended up  in care. Why can funding not be found for that programme? Mention was made  earlier of the need to stand over choices. We must examine the draft Budget  carefully to ensure that decisions can be justified, because many issues are  not currently being addressed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will turn briefly to the draft Budget allocation for  OFMDFM. I compared the figures for 2006-07 and 2010-11 and discovered some  interesting statistics. Health receives an 18&middot;8% increase over that period, and  OFMDFM receives a 51&middot;6% increase.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Why has the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister received an additional allocation of &pound;28&middot;7 million since 2006? Is that  a good use of our money? In 2001-02, some &pound;2,081,000 was allocated for central  administration. However, in the draft Budget, its allocation amounts to &pound;40 million  a year. What is going on? Is that a good use of our money? There has also been a huge increase in capital  investment. In 2006-07, some &pound;1&middot;5 million was allocated to the Office of  the First Minister and deputy First Minister for the three-year period. That  figure has now risen to &pound;52&middot;9 million.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">That money could be  better spent in my constituency on new health centres and health schemes  that have been put on hold. Moyle Hospital closed in 1994 and Carrickfergus Hospital closed some decades earlier, yet there have been no replacement state-of-the-art  facilities. There has been no significant capital infrastructure to put  right those wrongs, yet funding is being directed to other areas that have lost  acute services.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We need equality. We must ensure that facilities such as  Carrickfergus day centre, which closed due to a leaking roof and electrical  faults, are replaced. We must ensure that we provide good value for our money.  Why is so much money being spent by the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  At the outset, it may be necessary to claim the right to speak at all.  Yesterday, during a point of order that was not actually a point of order, the  Minister of Finance and Personnel talked of the need for a Programme for  Government and Budget to be agreed by the Assembly. He seemed to think that any  word of dissent at this stage was not appropriate.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps we should reduce the heat a little on this matter. This is a draft Budget &mdash; it is out for  consultation to Committees of the  Assembly and the public. Therefore, let  all concerns that are real be expressed. I am sure that the Minister will assure us that it is a genuine  consultation process and that he  will be willing to make adjustments where the case is good. There are  many variables still in the hands of the Minister, including the timing, and  many uncertainties, including Workplace 2010, the Varney Review and asset  sales. Therefore, there should be no suggestion that any adjustment to this  Budget is like the removal of a keystone that will cause the whole edifice to  collapse.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The context for this draft Budget is clear. Northern Ireland has an infrastructure, much of which is obsolete.  It has a private sector economy that is relatively small and fairly weak. Our main source of income is the  block grant from the Treasury. Northern Ireland does not pay its  way. It needs a subvention of several billion pounds per annum, perhaps up to  half of the &pound;16 billion of public spending  annually. The block grant is determined by the Barnett formula, and  those who know tell us that we do not get a bad deal from that mechanism. There  was a threat yesterday that we would hear a great deal more about the Barnett  formula, so perhaps we should listen to that advice.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The dramatic increases in public spending over recent years  are now over. Over the next three years of the comprehensive spending review,  public spending here will rise in real terms by just 1&middot;2% per annum. That is  not a large increase, but we should not dismiss it as nothing.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Our other main source of income is the regional rate, which  yields about &pound;500 million per annum, or 6% of what we spend. The scope for deriving  more income from the regional rate is constrained, as a result of the proposal  to include a charge for water and sewerage alongside the rates bill, which most  parties seem inclined to go along with as the least bad solution to a real  problem.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has indicated his proposal to freeze the domestic regional rate in absolute terms and the  business regional rate in real terms for three years. Given the pressure  on households, in particular, to pay for water, there will not be much dissent  from those proposals. Almost half of the block grant is already spoken for in  the annually managed expenditure that is allocated for social security benefits  and the like.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We are now debating how to carve up the remaining money  among the Departments. The Minister told us in the speech that introduced the  draft Budget that the annual amounts will run from &pound;8&middot;3 billion to &pound;8&middot;9 billion  over the Budget period. There is also ISNI money &mdash; I must tell Nelson  McCausland that that ISNI isnae Ulster Scots. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span><span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">That money ranges from &pound;1&middot;6 billion to &pound;1&middot;8 billion over  the period for investment in basic infrastructure. Those are large sums, and  they will enable substantial improvements to be made to the quality of life of  all our people.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There are major pressures on the Budget. Every Department  has a list of necessary projects, but not all of those demands can be  satisfied. I must express concerns about particular spending programmes. The  first relates to the provision for social and affordable housing. The draft Budget  document states of DSD:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Department&rsquo;s aims are to make a difference to the  lives of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our society through providing  access to decent affordable and energy efficient housing.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Those are exactly the right aims, and I am sure  that every Member will support them. Other Members of my party will expand on  those concerns about that aspect of the draft Budget.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Another matter that relates to housing is the funding for  improving the energy efficiency and insulation standards of homes, which is to  be drastically cut. It astonishes me that that programme is to be cut back,  rather than increased. Again, other SDLP Members will say more on that matter,  but I note Martina Anderson&rsquo;s comments, and I welcome the indications that her  party will support an increase to the DSD&rsquo;s budget to allow it to address that  matter.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Efficiency savings have been given a significant place in  the Minister&rsquo;s plans. The 3% and 5% cumulative year-on-year targets are central  to his ability to deliver. Nearly half of the:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;increase in health departmental spending power&rdquo; &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">&mdash; will come from those savings in the third year. We must  note the language that is used in some of the DFP information. There is much  use of the interesting phrase, &ldquo;spending power&rdquo;, but it is not, to a  significant degree, real money. Built into that spending power are savings that  are yet to be realised. There has been very little scrutiny of efficiency  targets, and I intend to ask the Committee for Finance and Personnel to examine  those more closely. Are such savings in the health sector really available in  the short term in a service that is so dependent on front line staff? There is  no doubt that we need a better Health Service, and that that will mean great  structural change, but it will not happen overnight.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, much has been made of the potential of the  performance and efficiency delivery unit. I heard the Minister offering its  services to the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety recently,  and that made me wonder how it would really work. Evidently, it has an opt-in  or voluntary nature. Again, the Committee  must examine that mechanism extremely closely and, indeed, all  Committees should reflect on how it will affect them and their work.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to raise a few issues that affect my own  constituency of North Antrim, the first of  which caused real alarm recently. The new health and care centre that was  promised for Ballymena within two or three years, and which would have  revolutionised healthcare in the community right up to the north coast, has  been written out of the script. That is  shocking and totally unexpected news. Representatives for North Antrim from all political parties in the House are  aghast, and will be lobbying the Assembly to reinstate the centre. I cannot  understand why that has happened, and I hope that I will have the support of  all Members for North Antrim in addressing  that matter &mdash; some of them are in rather influential positions and must have  missed that part of the draft Budget.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I shall mention other North Antrim  concerns only briefly. I welcome recent steps towards a development for Rathlin Island, and I want to see provisions for  the outcomes of that in the Budget. The railway relay from Coleraine to Derry has been announced in the press. I assume that there is some substance behind that  announce&shy;ment, but it is missing from the draft Programme for Government  and the draft Budget. Can we have clarification on when that will happen?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that money has been put in reserve for a contribution  to the proposal from the National Trust and Moyle District Council for a  visitors&rsquo; centre at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway. We  may, at last, get a resolution to that situation, which has become an  embarrassment for several Ministers.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that our rural roads, which are a disgrace, will  finally get some real money spent on them.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I want to mention one agricultural issue. The  proposals for the reduction of brucellosis and TB in cattle will not work, and  that money would be better spent on a full eradication programme, which will be  cheaper in the long run.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I congratulate the Minister of Finance and Personnel on the  presentation of his first draft Budget. Although my party does not agree with  every aspect of it, I recognise that it is a substantial piece of work. It puts  to rest the notion that six months is too short a time for the Executive to produce anything meaningful.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">One matter requires  clarification. At the outset of the debate, Martina Anderson referred to  the draft Budget being a legacy. However, when the Minister of Finance and  Personnel presented the draft Budget, he was keen to point out that it  represents a major break from direct rule Ministers&rsquo; Budgets. The draft Budget  cannot be both those things: it must be one or the other. There is an  interesting split of opinion in the Executive.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Committee  for Finance and Personnel for tabling  the motion. Although the Alliance Party had tabled an amendment, it is  content to accept the advice and guidance  of the Speaker on the matter and withdraw the amendment accordingly. My party respects the Speaker&rsquo;s rulings,  unlike some Members that I could mention.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that there is no amendment on which some notes of  concern can coalesce should not, nevertheless, leave the Executive in any doubt  that there are major concerns about the  content of the draft Budget, not only from my party but from other  quarters in the House. There will be many future opportunities to test those  matters formally through Divisions. Like many other Members, Alliance Party  Members welcome the draft Budget&rsquo;s economic focus. However, it is important not  to allow the economic delivery claims that have been made to go without  challenge and proper scrutiny.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">During the past decade, there has been a peace dividend.  However, despite economic growth and investment  during recent years, major structural problems remain. There must be an  overarching imperative to rebalance the economy between the public and private  sectors. Public finances are hugely dependent on financial subvention from the  Treasury &mdash; some &pound;7 billion each year &mdash; which funds almost half of the local  services. That is clearly unsustainable. The Minister is on record as saying  that the problem in Northern    Ireland is not that the public sector is too  large but that the private sector is too small. However, that stance seems to  have changed somewhat, with an open challenge being posed to the public sector.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Unemployment now stands at under 4%. However, beneath that  percentage lies the societal indictment that 27% of the working-age population  are economically inactive. That is a huge wasted resource for the entire  community and its shared prosperity.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Much of the recent  investment and rapid employment growth  has occurred in the relatively lower-added-value sectors of the economy.  The overarching economic imperative must now be to close the productivity gap between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK  average, which is measured by gross  value added (GVA). In order to shift  that, more high-value-added investment, promo&shy;tion of exports and more  high-paid jobs are required. The figure has been stuck at around 80% of UK average employment figures for quite some  time, and the problem lies with UK  regional policy. Despite the platitudes from successive Governments on the need  to develop the regions, nothing is allowed to challenge the dominant position  of London and the south-east of England as the main drivers of the UK economy.  Financial dependency is tolerated rather than the regions being given  the means to become more sustainable.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I note that the Executive have shifted the target for GVA  to halving the gap with the UK  average minus the greater south-east of England.  Although, in one respect, it might be nice to remove the distorting  influence of the south-east, moving the goalposts in that manner does not do Northern Ireland  any favours. Overall consideration must be given to the balance in the UK economy as a  whole. There is little point in comparing Northern   Ireland with the other dependent regions and fighting over the scraps, and not effectively  challenging the overall centralisation of the UK economy.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget&rsquo;s rhetoric and aspirations for the economy  are lofty and ambitious. However, they pose two  fundamental questions: first, does Northern Ireland have the  necessary tools to make a step change to the economy? In the absence of  tax-varying powers or other fiscal incentives, it is difficult to see how that  step change can be realised. The one fiscal tool at the Executive&rsquo;s disposal &mdash;  industrial derating &mdash; is essentially anachronistic. If anything, it is geared  to subsidising a low-value-added economy rather than attracting  high-value-added jobs. It deals with the status  quo rather than the type of economy that Members want for Northern Ireland.  I appreciate the fact that there are few alternatives and that, therefore, we  must support it regardless. However, it is important that the limitations of  that approach are recognised.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Varney Review&rsquo;s indications are not encour&shy;aging. What  is left is incremental change rather than a step change.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The jury is out on whether we are using to their full  effect the existing tools and instruments that are at our disposal, and there  are grounds to be sceptical.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The four remaining main  economic drivers are skills, enterprise, innovation and infrastructure.  Of those drivers, the most critical area of emphasis is skills. The targets for PhDs in the draft Budget and draft  Programme for Government may prove to be too conservative, especially if the brain drain continues. Moreover,  stronger incentives for students to study the STEM subjects &mdash; science,  technology, engineering and mathematics &mdash; are needed. By the same token, at the  other end of the spectrum, the core issues of numeracy and literacy are being  neglected. Without addressing numeracy and literacy, it is doubtful whether we  will have a critical mass of workers who are able to play their role in the  global economy.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned that more effort has not been put into  improving the public-transport infrastructure. Figures in the draft investment  strategy suggest that 60% of funds will be invested in roads in the first three  years, and that that will rise to 80% over 10 years. That is almost a mirror  image of the situation in the rest of the United Kingdom. Although we must  catch up on the infrastructure backlog,  there are environmental concerns to consider. If we are to have a  modern, twenty-first century infrastructure, especially in Belfast, we must invest more heavily in  public transport from the overall transport budget.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am surprised that greater emphasis has not been placed on  the potential of the green economy and, in particular, on the new economic  opportunities that will arise from tackling climate change. Questions also arise about the resources earmarked to assist the  economy, and about whether those resources are being used to full  effect. More and more resources are to be poured into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and  Invest NI. However, whether there is to be any fundamental change in their  approach is far from clear.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">At the risk of angering farmers, I note that &pound;45 million  has been set aside for modernising the agriculture industry. That sector  represents only 2% of the economy, and I cannot help wondering whether that  money would be better used in another sector, in which there is higher growth  potential. This morning we heard about the tourism industry, for example. It  also represents approximately 2% of the economy, but it is an area in which  there exists a great deal more room for expansion. Perhaps the resources set  aside for agriculture could be better deployed in assisting with rural  transition and more general development.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We must also be conscious of the impact on the economy, especially on small businesses, of the  scaling-back of investment in public services. I include the building of  social housing in that. Members must be aware that the deep divisions in Northern Ireland  have an impact on the economy. Economic change and creating a shared future go  hand in hand. Therefore, the scarcity of the resources that have been made  available to invest in providing shared and mixed facilities and to promote  good relations is a major flaw.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I intend to make a few overarching comments on the more  general resource allocations rather than delve into too much detail. That said,  I have major concerns over the health and housing budgets, and I am sure that  other Members will address those concerns. A tight UK comprehensive spending review  has been made even tighter by decisions to freeze the regional rate, to reintroduce water charges within the ambit of the  regional rate and to reduce the level  of planned overcommitment. Much now depends on the 3% efficiency savings  to be found across Departments. All Whitehall Departments are attempting to  achieve the same targets, so Northern    Ireland is not unique in that respect. Those  savings are achievable, and, in fact, annual cost savings in the private sector  are routinely achieved at the beginning of  a Budget process. However, our problem is that there is an almost  singular focus on achieving savings from internal  running costs and procedures rather than through taking a hard look at  how public services are delivered.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The process of CSR bids by Departments here, and the  subsequent questions about which of them have been addressed and which have  not, means that the focus inevitably falls on the additional extra 2% or 3%.  Little attention is paid beyond and below the baseline. At the other end of the  debate, it is arguable that our Departments&rsquo; bids were overly conservative and  that major investments have both been lost and not been offered. Even with that  conservative mindset, only about half of the CSR bids are to be funded through  the Budget. There is a transparency issue, and the Alliance Party has had to  table several questions in order to get to the heart of some of the issues.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">For some time, the Alliance Party has highlighted the vast  amount of resources that are tied up in Northern Ireland to maintain a  divided society. Huge opportunity costs are involved in investing in quality  public services for the entire community. We have estimated them at around  about &pound;1 billion a year, but a report by Deloitte goes a step further and says  that the figure is as high as &pound;1&middot;5 billion each year. Sadly, the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister has binned that report. Those costs  are clearly embedded in the system through duplication in the provision of  goods, facilities and services, and it will take many years to unlock them.  However, we must start now by investing those additional resources. That could  have been the subject of any peace dividend. There is a real economic and  financial imperative to creating a shared future, and, although the Minister of  Finance and Personnel alluded to the Deloitte report in his draft Budget  statement, there is little evidence that he has considered its contents in his  actual proposals, and in the details of the actual bids and efficiency savings.  Education is one area in which a great deal more work must be done.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate. Although you have ruled  on and rejected the amendments, Mr Speaker, I note that those who tabled them  still took the opportunity to level the criticisms that they contained. Some of  the strange claims that have been made in the Chamber today reflect the  contents of those amendments. The House was almost subjected, for a third time,  to an Alliance Party amendment criticising the supposed lack of innovative  thinking in the draft forms of the Programme for Government, the investment  strategy and the Budget. The failure of Alliance Party Members to come up with  anything new demonstrates that the real lack of innovative thinking lies with  them.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The first claim that must be refuted is that the draft  Budget is somehow unable to deliver economic growth in Northern Ireland.  Given the comments made after the publication of the draft Budget &mdash; which has  been branded the most economy-focused and business-friendly ever &mdash; that is a  particularly peculiar claim. In some quarters, the draft Budget has even been  branded Thatcherite and right wing.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth recalling some comments that were made in the  aftermath of the draft Budget&rsquo;s publication, both in evidence to the Committee  for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment and to the press. The Federation of Small Businesses  offered an enthusiastic response to the proposals. The Confederation of British  Industry in Northern Ireland  said that it strongly supported the focus on productivity, strongly welcomed  the increased commitment to Invest Northern Ireland and welcomed the increased  resources being allocated to tourism. The Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce  and Industry welcomed the fact that the  Executive regard the develop&shy;ment of the economy as their top priority.  Declan Billington of the Institute of Directors stated that the draft Budget  would build confidence across the business community  in Northern Ireland to join with Government in investing in our future.  Finally, Michael Wightman of the Northern  Ireland Manufacturing Focus Group said:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The NIFMG is both  relieved and delighted that &hellip; the Stormont Executive has listened to us &hellip;  today&rsquo;s draft Budget has given manufacturing a real boost.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That view is consistent among Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  business leaders. I am sure that I will be forgiven for accepting the view of  the local business community, as opposed to that of the Alliance Party, on the  draft Budget&rsquo;s ability to stimulate economic growth.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The second claim, which is trotted out ad infinitum by the  Alliance Party, is that the draft Budget will not tackle the issue of resources  being directed away from a divided society. I will not allow the hypocrisy of  the Alliance Party to go unchallenged. Only a matter of weeks ago, on Tuesday  13 November, the Alliance Party voted for a club bank to assist the  Irish-medium schools sector. That is a more  divisive and costly example of a divided society. The Alliance Party  cannot criticise the draft Budget and, at the same time, demand money to create  more division. In yesterday&rsquo;s debate, my colleague Peter Weir commented on how  the Alliance Party&rsquo;s cost-of-division dogma is becoming tiresome and compared  its credibility to that of the promise of its sister party, the Liberal  Democrats, to put 1p on income tax.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget will be broadly welcomed across Northern Ireland.  The cap on industrial rating at 30% demonstrates the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to  develop&shy;ment and their consideration of the many costs that businesses face.  People will be particularly pleased by the Minister of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s  announcement of a three-year freeze in the regional rate. It is funny that, although some parties complain about the  allocation to one Department or another, I hear few moaning about that  freeze.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party claims that a financial package  did not materialise, and it is worth elaborating on some of Mr Roy Beggs&rsquo;s  earlier comments. He talked about the lack  of a &ldquo;&pound;1 billion financial package&rdquo;. However, if the matter is to be  discussed, it is worth basing it on fact. Ulster Unionist Party Members  participated fully in negotiations when they trotted off to Downing   Street with the rest of the political parties. Several core  elements were negotiated, including guaranteed flat real growth, an additional  &pound;100 million each year over the CSR period, access to additional spending under  end-year flexibility of &pound;320 million and the retention of asset sales of &pound;500  million.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In negotiations on the CSR, the Minister of Finance and  Personnel achieved &pound;443 million over and above the previous CSR guarantee,  access to additional end-year funding of almost &pound;300 million and access to over  &pound;100 million of borrowing on reinvestment and reform initiatives.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps my mathematics are better than those of the Member  for East Antrim Roy Beggs, but I am sure that that adds up to well in excess of  &pound;1 billion.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Yes, so that the Member can apologise for his error.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member tell the House what is the amount of new money, instead of  talking about recycled money from selling off our assets? It is normal practice  that one can reinvest assets in other capital projects. Moreover, end-year  flexibility is normally provided, once applied for. I accept that &pound;100 million  has been provided, but where is the &pound;1 billion of new money, rather than  recycled money?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Member might be confusing the rules of assets sales with those that he has  experienced at local council level, and perhaps he is not aware of the  Treasury&rsquo;s rules. Perhaps the Member does not want poorly utilised assets to be  sold on, and the money to be reclaimed.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Does the Member agree with his leader, Ian Paisley, who, after the Chancellor&rsquo;s  announcement about the supposed extra &pound;1 billion &mdash; over four years, mark you &mdash;  said:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Progress has been made in some areas, but I do not  believe there is anything in the present proposals of the Chancellor which will  lead to the step change in the economy that is needed&rdquo;?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">No package; no &pound;1 billion &mdash; that is why we are  scrabbling for money.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Member might find it useful to listen to the sums of money that has been  outlined.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: I wonder whether, as he looks at  quotes from various people over the years, Basil McCrea is aware of the  gestation period that applied to the financial package. Prior to devolution, a  Programme for Government Committee met in the Assembly, of which the various  parties were members. I asked the other parties to hold back from going into  Government until we secured a satisfactory package, but none of them supported  that. Indeed, Mr McNarry publicly attacked the DUP for its position of holding  out to get more money from the Chancellor.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  We all recall how the Ulster Unionist Party was itching to jump into Government  at the last election, irrespective of a financial package or the actions of the  republican movement. The Ulster Unionists were dying to get into Government,  although now it seems that some of them are dying to get out. It is unreal that  the Ulster Unionist Party levels any criticism at the DUP Benches, given its  total failure to even raise the issue of a financial package &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  No; I have given way enough.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP remembers that the Ulster Unionists were too busy  trying to feather their own nests by seeking knighthoods to ask for capital  investment or money for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The final &mdash; and outrageous &mdash; claim that must be tackled is  that the health budget has been poorly funded. I am staggered and astonished  that anyone could consider an allocation that represents 51&middot;5% of all  additional money, and 48% of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s total Budget, as a bad deal.  Expenditure on health and social care in Northern   Ireland is over 10% higher than in England, which  is a trend that the Budget will continue. Spending on health has more than  doubled since 2001, yet no one would argue that the NHS is performing twice as  well. That proves Appleby&rsquo;s point that the key is not the amount of resources,  but how they are utilised.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Instead of adopting Oliver Twist&rsquo;s begging-bowl approach,  the Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety should address the  serious inefficiencies in the NHS in Northern   Ireland: staff productivity; consultant productivity;  hospital throughput; average length of stay in hospital; and prescription  charges; are all worse than in England.  I sense that the Minister has not got the stomach for the challenge, but in the  spirit of generosity &mdash; and for the betterment of the people of Northern Ireland  &mdash; I extend a helping hand to him. If the Minister has not got the bottle to do  it, there are Members who will help. The Members who made those claims must  state from which Departments they would take resources for jobs, schools or  planning.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  OFMDFM.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I hear OFMDFM being suggested as the place where the money should be taken  from, as if taking money away from there would be a positive thing. I am sure that the Member will revisit his  comments when he considers that responsibility for the innocent victims of terrorist violence is included within  OFMDFM.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is almost up.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Thank you very much.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Would the UUP pay for it by trebling the rates bill?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to take his seat.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I commend the Budget to the House.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to take his seat, and I remind Members to address their  comments through the Chair.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ni Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Just as I dared to doze, things  started to liven up. Ba mhaith liom taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don r&uacute;n. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Say nothing.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">After yesterday&rsquo;s debate on the draft Programme for  Government it is clear that there are tensions and difficulties in trying to  reconcile the vision that is set out in it with the investment strategy. There  are clearly difficulties in trying to reconcile the differences between  departmental bids and the aspirations set out in the departmental Budget statements.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There is also concern in the community about the impact of  the draft Budget, particularly on funding for community projects, which will  undoubtedly be covered in the consultations between now and the new year. I  wish to mention some of the issues that have been brought to my attention, both  as Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s health spokesperson and as one of the six MLAs for North Belfast.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We need to decide on an approach to healthy living, as  opposed to solely tackling ill health. Our approach to health provision and social  care is deficient, and the challenge for the Assembly is in how we tackle that.  Members will expect me to say this, but I do want to see the implementation of  Bairbre de Br&uacute;n&rsquo;s Investing for Health strategy.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Prevention should be at the heart of our approach to the inequalities in health and how they can be  addressed. Forty-eight per cent of the overall Budget is dedicated to  health and social care, yet there is still massive under-resourcing and  difficulty in the Health Service. The public has huge interest in proper  investment in the Health Service, particularly in mental health, and yet there  is a shortfall in the bid for mental health and the implementation of the  Bamford Review, which has caused a lot of concern. I appeal to the Department  of Health and the Minister to find a resolution.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There must be a reconciliation of the 2013 Bamford target  in the draft Programme for Government and the two Bamford bids. That is crucial  to meeting the aspirations of those working in mental health and restoring public  confidence. Anything less will ensure that the mental-health service will  remain &ldquo;the Cinderella service&rdquo;.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Ill health reduces  economic activity, and the evidence shows that mental illness reduces  economic output, so greater investment in health is a strategic measure for  improving economic performance. There are clearly gaps between the funds that  are available for service development and the totals required.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Social Development also causes concern  in the community. Although DSD received an additional &pound;27 million a few weeks  ago in the last monitoring round, there has been a proposal to cut the warm  homes scheme by 50%, as well as an inability to deliver social and affordable  homes in the new-build programme. DSD has more assets, land and properties than  any other Department. The draft Programme for Government states that:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Inequalities exist, and we must strive to eliminate  all forms of inequality.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, in the area-at-risk programme, &pound;3 million  of funding was skewed towards loyalist areas. There is grave concern about  that, about the blatant disregard for objective need as a criterion and about  how equality for all plays out in communities.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The voluntary and community sectors, most of which provide  excellent and invaluable support for all the  people, require services that need to be supported on a long-term basis  instead of the piecemeal approach that has drawn complaints recently. The  overarching responsibility of the Executive is to proactively change the  existing patterns of social disadvantage, not to replicate them.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Social Development&rsquo;s Minister is a  member of the Executive &mdash; sometimes &mdash; and has responsibility for that commitment.  How will the circle be squared? How will we explain that to the people who are  on the housing waiting list in north Belfast?  Anything from 76% to 85% of nationalists are waiting for a home, and a right to  a home is enshrined in human rights legislation.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone agrees that there is not enough money in the draft  Budget. We must examine the legacy of underfunding, and deprivation in  infrastructure and social services. Every  Department faces tough decisions. There is a need to show creativity and  imagination &mdash; and no need for scaremongering. We need leadership, and not  emotional blackmail. The unofficial opposition must tell us what they intend to  do, instead of what they do not.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I support the take-note debate on the draft Budget.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  The draft Budget and draft Programme for Government have been set against a  backdrop of tight financial settlements. When we consider all that the  documents contain, it is obvious that a mid-  to long-term view has been taken in producing the draft. However, it is  such a pity that some in the Assembly are so short-sighted that they cannot see  that the aim is a sustainable development, growth and expansion of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s economy. Perhaps after  today&rsquo;s debate they will clearly see the true scope and vision of the  proposals.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Although it must be remembered that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s public money does not come from a bottomless  pit, the variety and scope of the draft programme is truly great. It includes the expansion of the infrastructure  needed to satisfy modern investment; deferring water rates &mdash; indeed reducing them; increasing the educational  attainment of our young people; reducing levels of poverty; increasing the  levels of economic activity; protecting our environment; reducing the number of  deaths on our roads; reducing treatment times and increasing the survival rate  of bowel cancer and strokes. All that has come from an Assembly in which there  are still critics.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">If the draft Budget lacks vision, I fail to see how and  where. Improvements are envisaged in every Department &mdash; something that cannot  be said about direct-rule policies. Most of all, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s own elected  representatives have devised and agreed the draft Budget to fund the draft  Programme for Government. That is an  achievement that some Members fail to recognise. Perhaps they do not  have seats at the Executive table and, therefore, have decided instead to be  negative.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am proud to be a Member of an Assembly that has such a  vision for Northern Ireland.  It has identified the very real needs that exist in the Province, has the  courage to develop unique policies that can begin to address those needs and is  delivering the government for which it was democratically elected by the people  of Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As the First Minister said on 8 May 2007, we are only at  the beginning of the process of developing Northern Ireland to ensure a stable  economy, respect and equality for all, increased opportunity, a rise in the  level of economic activity, the provision of good healthcare and a pleasant  environment to live in. That begins with this draft Budget.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I support the draft Budget and the motion.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  The debate provides me with a further opportunity to highlight the real  difficulties that the draft Budget creates  for the Health Service. Further&shy;more, it allows me to respond to some of  the na&iuml;ve comments that were made in the Chamber yesterday. As the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety, it is my duty to set out the  perspective as I find it on the ground.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As an Executive, we have a shared objective to ensure that  people have access to the best health and social care services possible within  the resources available. We need an informed debate based on the real world. I  do not ask for the sun, the moon and the seven stars. I have reduced my bids to  levels that could be met without catastrophe either for the ratepayer or for  any other area of public services. I am as committed as anyone to securing  reform, efficiency and productivity.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I know that there are limits on what is possible, and that  we all face difficult choices. Who knows what the position could have been if  economic packages had been delivered as promised by some?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There is a cross-party consensus at Westminster, supported by independent  experts, that the National Health Service model requires significant  investment. Moreover, it is agreed that radical action is needed to promote  prevention and reform to make the system better for patients. I am committed to  doing just that.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The outcome of the comprehensive spending review has  reflected that, with a 3&middot;7% real-terms increase in England over the next three years.  In Northern Ireland,  where the need is greater, the increase is only 1%.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I believe passionately  in the principles of the National Health Service: that it must be free  at the point of use, and provide services from the cradle to the grave. If we  fail to adequately fund the Health Service in Northern Ireland, those principles  will be at risk, and we would be undermining the service for those who depend  on it the most. Frankly, that is not acceptable.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Health is not about politics; it is about saving lives. That there has been so much debate about funding  proves how important this issue is. I have no problem working with the  Minister of Finance and Personnel, the Health Committee, and others, and,  indeed, I welcome their assistance in attempting to reach a solution.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There have been comments to the effect that, despite high  levels of funding, the Health Service has not improved. People have complained  that the service is over-bureaucratic, inefficient and ineffective. Let us  remember the dire situation that we faced five years ago: horrendous trolley  waits, growing waiting lists, and a service that was not performing. Things  have changed for the better, and the facts prove that. For example, in March  2006, there were 74,000 people waiting for more than six months for a first  outpatient appointment. By March this year, that total had fallen to only 32.  Trolley waits are being eradicated, there will be a maximum of a four-hour wait  in accident and emergency by March 2008, and delayed discharges are being  eliminated. Of course, I could go on, but the point is that this is not all  about money.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Tackling inefficiencies is essential. About &pound;115 million of  savings have already been achieved. I am committed to delivering a further &pound;343  million of savings over the next three years, including in administration  costs. Approximately &pound;500 million of savings will be found and pumped back into  essential front line services. That will not be easy. Difficult decisions must  be made. However, I will make them. If I am able to achieve more efficiencies,  I will do so. However, my priority is to safeguard the quality of patient care  &mdash; not simply to make cuts.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Much has also been said about needs, and there has been a  dispute about the level of need. There should not be a dispute. Professor John  Appleby&rsquo;s report, &lsquo;Independent Review of  Health and Social Care Services in Northern   Ireland&rsquo;, highlighted a greater need in Northern Ireland.  Officials in my Department and in the Department of Finance and Personnel  considered the need identified by the Appleby steering group, and agreed that  the best available estimate is of a 14% to 15% greater need in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Compared to England,  no one can dispute the fact that our Health Service is underfunded by &pound;300  million. Neither is there any disagreement that, in just three years time, the  draft Budget will leave the Health Service with a massive &pound;600 million funding  gap. However, I do not wish to get sidetracked by numbers. This is not about  figures, it is about need, and no one should be in any doubt about that. The  growing gap between services here and in the rest of the UK is not  acceptable. Our people deserve better. They pay taxes and National Insurance  like everyone else in the UK  &mdash; why should they be penalised?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Let us compare health services in Northern Ireland and England. It is simply unacceptable  that, if we had the same rate of deaths from heart disease as the rest of the UK, 300 fewer people would die each year in Northern Ireland.  If we had the same adoption rates as England, another 50 to 60 children  in care would be adopted each year. It is not acceptable that waiting times for  all services are much longer in Northern    Ireland. Death rates from bowel cancer are  16% higher than the UK  average. When adjusted for need, funding for mental-health and  learning-disability services is approximately 34% lower than in England. The  gap in children&rsquo;s services is similar.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I intend to make the best use of all the resources at my  disposal. Additional resources that have been added to my budget amount to &pound;455  million by year 3. That is not even enough to meet the inescapable pressures of  pay, price, demography and existing commitments. I must use the major part of my  efficiency savings to cover inescapable costs, which leaves only &pound;16 million in  year 1 to introduce and improve services.  The draft Programme for Government sets out the improvements that I wish  to make to a range of services, such as mental health, learning disability,  community, stroke and cancer services &mdash;</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Let me finish.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Most of those improvements will not be in place until 2011.  With only &pound;16 million available next year, this is effectively a stand-still  Budget for the next two years in respect of health.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Let me be clear also about some of the things that I cannot  do. I will not be able to improve hospital waiting times.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Mr Speaker, I am not giving way.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">People with mental-health and learning-disability problems  will remain in hospitals. The introduction of free prescriptions, free eye  examinations and free personal care are all unaffordable. Measures to reduce  death rates from cancer and heart disease cannot be implemented. Additional,  specialist, salaried foster-carers to support children on the edge of care will  not be provided. The breast-cancer screening programme cannot be extended to  include women aged between 65 and 70. Access to new, life-changing drugs will  be deferred or delayed, and at least 3,000 people with chronic illnesses will have unnecessary hospital admissions.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">That list is unacceptable to Members and to the public.  This Budget is only a draft, and it is a basis for consultation with the  Assembly and the general public. That fact was confirmed by the Executive at  last Thursday&rsquo;s meeting. Resources can be changed through consultation, not  through scaremongering or through talk about tripling the rates, but by  re-examining our priorities.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will play my part in delivering exceptionally challenging  efficiency savings and improving productivity in the National Health Service in  Northern Ireland.  However, if the draft Budget is approved as it stands, a conscious decision  will have been taken to ignore the advice of independent and highly regarded  experts, such as Wanless and Appleby. Those experts have told us consistently  that higher levels of resources are needed to deal with demographic trends and  the cost of new technologies.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I would be failing in my role as Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety if I did not continue to fight for a better Health  Service. The people of Northern    Ireland deserve better; they deserve a  Health Service of which we can all be proud. If the draft Budget is approved as  it stands, everyone will lose. Health is the one issue that touches everyone in  society. My priorities are putting patients first and delivering a world-class  Health Service.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Frankly, this draft Budget fails to deliver for the Health  Service and for the people of Northern    Ireland.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mr Durkan)</strong>: I wish to make some remarks as Chairperson of the  Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, and I will make others as an SDLP Member for Foyle.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment has benefited from hearing  the views of several stake&shy;holders, and more briefing sessions have been  promised. The Committee welcomes the fact that growing the economy is a  top priority in the Programme for Government and that that is reflected in the  Budget.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget proposals for the Department provide  resource and capital allocations that broadly align with what the Committee  generally considers to be the Department&rsquo;s key spending priorities in  contributing to growing a dynamic, innovative economy. The Committee notes that  the funding for INI is more securely based than it was under the previous  concordat. However, we recognise that some of the spirit of the concordat  remains in the industrial development guarantee, which provides that no  worthwhile proposal for eligible support to investment in industry or tradable  services will be lost, even if that means diverting other resources.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee wants to ensure that, if the need to resort  to that industrial development guarantee should arise &mdash; possibly as a result of  great success following the US/NI investment conference &mdash; it would not be used  at the expense of some of the other budget commitments relating to  cross-cutting efforts on skills, wider  economic development, research and development, training and innovation.  Those matters are integral to growing the innovative economy.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has noted with some concern that no specific  identifiable resources have been allocated so far to local enterprise and the  social economy. We will be examining that area in the hope that that will be  changed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday, in the debate on the draft Programme for  Government, I recorded concern about innovation funding. In a high-profile  announcement, the former Chancellor allocated money for innovation, and further  moneys were allocated in support of innovation from the Irish Government.  Additional money has been provided for innovation, but there is no visible  additional innovation funding in the Budget. The Committee wants to be assured  that the new innovation funding is not being used to cover pre-existing  innovation funds. The Committee hopes that work on that issue will be more  visible and positive by the time of the revised Budget.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There are resource and capital allocations that will enable  the Tourist Board to improve its role. The Committee is disappointed that so  far there has been no indication of any bids that were made to support the regional  tourism partnerships, and it is not clear what allocations they will receive.  The Tourist Board has an important job, as does Tourism Ireland, but the regional tourism partnerships  also have an important role to play, both locally and in making sure that there  is good meshing between Tourism Ireland  and the Tourist Board.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee wants money to go specifically to tourism  product development. I noted what the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment said about  that this morning in his statement. Therefore, the Committee looks forward to  positive engagement on that issue.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We recognise that moneys are being provided for the five  signature projects. I champion the importance of the Walled City  signature tourism project in my constituency, which has made good progress  compared to other projects. However, that does not mean that it is not in need  of more funding and more backing. Obviously, there are issues about the funding  gap for the Titanic Quarter. We will also wait with interest to find out what  is happening regarding the allocation that is provided for the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway visitors&rsquo; centre. Money that we were  told was earmarked for the public-sector project is still there, so Members  will be interested to find out what happens to that.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee welcomes the fact that Safe Start NI will  receive funding in year 2 of the cycle; however, we would have preferred that  that take place in the first year of this spending round.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is concerned about unmet bids from the  Department regarding EU structural funds. The Department will have a managing  and certifying role for the competitiveness programme, yet there are no new  resources to meet that new role. Similarly, there was a high discretionary  administration bid regarding obligations under the energy end-use efficiency  and energy services directive, and that has not been met either. Those are both  important areas.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Regarding EU funding, the Committee recognises that DETI is  benefiting considerably from the Peace III programme. We also recognise that  different parties and other sectors might have different views of that. Those  views might be reflected by other Departments during the course of the draft  Budget. If there is any revisiting of the share of the Peace III funding that  has been envisaged for DETI, and if that is to go to some other Department&rsquo;s  budget lines, my Committee will want that transfer made good in the DETI budget  lines so that the purposes and priorities of the Programme for Government are  properly reflected.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Suggestions were made last night and elsewhere that Members  are not allowed to have the view that there can be any improvement or any  material revision of either the draft Budget or the draft Programme for  Government. Clearly, improvement and revision are required. It is the  Assembly&rsquo;s job to contribute to such consultation and such reconsideration.  Parties cannot say that it is their way and their say only, and that no other Members are allowed to have an alternative  view.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">When the draft Budget and the draft Programme for  Government were being presented, the Ministers went out of their way to misrepresent the record of the previous Executive  and, in particular, to attack other parties. They cannot then insist that those  other parties do not have the right to  outline their views of the draft Budget.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, we recognise your ruling regarding amendments,  and I fully understand and accept the reason for that ruling.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Some of us have been at pains to highlight the inadequacy,  as we see it, of the allocations for health and housing. In this, the SDLP is  consistent with the position it adopted and agreed with other parties in the  Committee on the Preparation for Government and the Committee on the Programme  for Government. In those Committees, we expressed our views on how negotiations  with the Treasury might best be conducted and how input from the Irish  Government should be maximised. Other parties disagreed. Perhaps, had our  preferred tactics been adopted, there might have been a better outcome.  Nevertheless, although different views on tactics were held, we did nothing to  interfere with the negotiating stance taken by those who had to take the lead  in the Northern Ireland  interest.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We were not out to create problems or difficulties. The  same is true of the submissions to the Varney Review. On the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment, I ensured that nothing was done to  queer the pitch for the Executive and their negotiating position on  behalf of the broad regional interest.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is with that record of responsibility on those issues  that the SDLP insists that it has the absolute right to interrogate the details  of the draft Budget. If we did not do so, we would not be doing our job. In  looking at the draft Budget, we have the right to say that more money is needed  up front for housing. I also ask the Minister of Finance and Personnel whether  money emerging from the work of the capital realisation task force could go  into the housing budget. Will he indicate whether there is a golden rule in  relation to the capital realisation task force whereby moneys so realised  should be spent only as capital and not on programmes?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Also, there is no mention in the Programme for Government  or draft Budget about what will happen with respect to replacing the 11-plus &mdash;  it is obvious that that will have consequences for the Budget. The draft Budget  also includes allocations that presume significant efficiency savings in a  number of Departments; however, we are not sure whether all those efficiency  savings will be made. If they are not made, there will be a hole in the Budget.  Therefore, at whose expense will that be? At one level, I hope that it will not  be at the expense of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In circumstances in which Committees have not been fully  informed about the full implications of those efficiency savings, Members would  be wrong to nod through this draft Budget, on the blind, without asking any  further questions.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In this House, Members  have the right to raise issues, not just to praise Ministers.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and  Learning (Ms S Ramsey)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. To set the context, I must repeat some of the  comments that I made yesterday during the debate on the draft Programme for  Government.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is now well into the process of responding to  the draft Budget; however, as I said yesterday,  that work will not be complete until tomorrow when the Committee will  have an opportunity to discuss final matters with the Minister.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Following on from what Mark Durkan has said; this is a  take-note debate on a draft Budget that has been published for consultation. It  is important that our concerns as individual Members, Committee members, or  Chairpersons should be raised as part of the consultation process.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">When the Committee for Employment and Learning took  evidence from departmental representatives on the draft Budget, the  representatives expressed the view that they had achieved a mid-ranking result  as regards CSR bid outcomes. They believe that they won on a number of issues,  but that there were others in which they could have achieved better outcomes.  The Committee&rsquo;s overarching sense is that the allocation, while strong in  places, will not be sufficient to meet the goals and targets in the draft Programme  for Government for economic development.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In particular, although the Committee welcomes the emphasis  on an issue that was to be delivered by the Department, there is concern that  the moneys allocated to delivering the skills requirement could fall short of achieving the synergy that is necessary between  business growth and skills development.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is concerned that unless the skills base  exists to pre-empt, or meet, opportunities, investors could be frustrated and  opportunities could be missed. A number of specific issues illustrate that  concern. Yesterday, during the debate on the draft Programme for Government, I mentioned the discrepancy between the  programme&rsquo;s goals relating to R&amp;D and innovation, and the apparent lack of  resources &mdash; or at least, the lack of clarity on resources. The moneys available  for innovation appear to be inadequate to advance the cutting-edge research in  universities and in the private sector that the Executive tell us is required  to bring about the transformation of our traditional economy into a  knowledge-based one.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is aware that there are opportunities  available, for example, via the Science Foundation Ireland, but they are narrow. The  Committee urges the Executive to be creative in ensuring that investment in  research and development is prioritised in the short and medium term to secure longer-term economic gains.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The commitment to PhDs in the Programme for Government is  an unfunded bid. The Committee has heard that a proportion of the funding for  innovation will be utilised to meet that goal, but we are concerned that that  would spread an already thin amount of money even more thinly. The Department  said that there is a small amount of unallocated money from bids that could be  used for PhDs, and the Committee would welcome any movement in that direction.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Since devolution, much has been made of the need to  re-skill the workforce. The recent Leitch Review sets the context and  establishes challenging targets. However, a comprehensive spending review bid  from the Department for foreign direct investment for the employer support  programme for further education has not been funded. The Committee is concerned  that we could be facing a serious gap in adult training and apprenticeships  generally.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the critical sector initiatives, which is a  programme designed specifically to pre-empt and prepare for foreign direct  investment, has received only &pound;9 million over three years and nothing in the  first year. The Department&rsquo;s original bid was for &pound;24 million over three years,  so less than 40% of the bid has been achieved. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span><span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">That was Sir Reg Empey thanking me for fighting his corner.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">A major part of the Leitch Review focuses on essential  skills. As I said yesterday, the Committee has grave concerns on the Budget  allocation to deliver on this vital component. The Department has said that, to  an extent, it speculated and overbid &mdash; which the Finance Minister will  appreciate &mdash; which, looking closely at the numbers, may be the case. Nevertheless,  the Department said that it believes that  it has sufficient funding for essential skills. I will ensure that the Committee keeps this issue live on our work  programme to assess whether that is indeed the case.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee fully supports the Department&rsquo;s bid to include information and communications  technologies as a third essential skill. However, only &pound;5 million of an  &pound;11&middot;4 million bid has been received, which is approximately  40% over the next three years. The most worrying aspect is that there is  not even a baseline budget dedicated to that issue and nothing has been secured  for the first year. The Committee is concerned that the Department will  struggle to deliver on that important programme.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to those broad economic and skills-related  themes, there are other draft Budget issues that I would like to raise.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Issues arose at  Committee meetings relating to further and higher education  organisations that the Department says are autonomous. Although the Committee  accepts that universities and colleges should be commercially autonomous, it is  concerned that the Department could be losing control of significant social  goals. That may be an issue for the further education sector rather than the  universities. For example, concession rates offered by colleges are an important way of facilitating training for  particular groups, such as people on benefits, yet there is no consistency in  applying concession rates. The Committee has a general concern that budgetary  autonomy may not always work to deliver important goals related to social  cohesion. The Committee wishes to see clear incentives for further and higher  education institutions to tackle social inequalities, and we would like to see  those evidenced soon.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to issues in  higher education, the Committee has concerns that potential changes and  the widening of the upper and lower income thresholds would require an  additional &pound;18 million over the next three years. The Committee has been  informed that bids to meet this need are unfunded. The Committee does not wish to see any detriment to local students&rsquo;  maintenance arrangements and would ask that this situation be urgently  addressed.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  At least today&rsquo;s debate has been a bit more measured than yesterday&rsquo;s debate on  the draft Programme for Government. I do not doubt that that is partly due to  the fact that some of those who thought, yesterday, that they could be in  Government and in opposition at the same time, now begin to realise the consequences of that ludicrous and contradictory  stance. Perhaps that will enable us to have a more measured debate on  the draft Budget.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the leader  of the SDLP that the Assembly&rsquo;s job in when looking at the draft Budget  is not simply to rubber-stamp it and to say, &ldquo;Yes, that is great, everything is  OK.&rdquo; The job is to interrogate the draft Budget. It is a draft Budget. There  are opportunities to see whether some priorities should be dropped and other  measures brought forward as new priorities; to see whether there are ways in  which money could be better allocated; and to ask some pertinent questions  that, undoubtedly, will be answered later by the Minister of Finance and  Personnel.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, some of the Members who have spoken today are  still living off the old, tired arguments. They really think that today&rsquo;s  debate is an opportunity to simply hold out their hands and say that they want more, because they are afraid to take any hard  decisions. There are those who still hark back to something for which  they have been programmed. When I talk about someone who has been programmed,  the first person whom I think of is the  Member for East Antrim Mr Beggs, who shares my constituency. He was  programmed a long time ago when someone mentioned an &ldquo;economic package&rdquo; to him.  Ever since then, he has had a fixation with that economic package. On each  occasion when the Minister of Finance and Personnel has been present in the  Chamber &mdash; whether he has been talking about the draft Budget or not &mdash; Mr Beggs  has mentioned the economic package. I suspect that he may even talk about it in  his sleep; I do not know. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I can assure Members that I do not know whether he speaks  about it in his sleep. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> I am saying that  just in case rumours start.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There are two ways of judging whether the current package  is better, and is an advance on what we had previously. The first way is to  compare it with that which was received by previous Administrations. A number  of Ulster Unionist Party Assembly Members have talked about the importance of  the economic package. Let us consider the economic package that they delivered  to the people of Northern    Ireland. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am going to talk about the other way in a moment.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In order to be able to use the assets that Mr Beggs and Mr  Basil McCrea have said should be ours of right, they had to agree, under the  reinvestment and reform initiative (RRI), to put up the rates at three times  the rate of inflation. That is the type of economic package that the members of  the Ulster Unionist Party negotiated at a time &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Just let me finish this first. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">For goodness&rsquo; sake, let me finish. The Treasury was flush with money, and spending across all the  regions of the United    Kingdom was going up at twice or three times  the rate of inflation. That was the time when one would have thought that they  could have squeezed the most out of the Government at Westminster. Yet, that did not happen.  Nevertheless, during that period, before devolution was set up &mdash; and it has  already been set out and, therefore, I am not going to go through it again &mdash;  the end-year flexibility; the &pound;100 million addition to the CSR moneys coming  through; the release of asset sales; the access to end-year flexibility; and,  on top of that, in the current CSR negotiations,  the additional moneys that came through &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>: I  will give way in a minute, when I have finished this.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">On top of that, there are the additional moneys that came  through the CSR period, the asset sales and the money under RRI.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">All those things have added to the package. Is it as much  as we wanted? It would never be as much as we would want. Is it more than the  Ulster Unionist Party got? Yes &mdash; of course it is more than the Ulster Unionist  Party got. That is how it should be judged.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: Does the Member accept that the borrowing that is proposed  will avail of the same interest rates that were negotiated by the Ulster  Unionist Party and the SDLP? Those were essentially Bank of England base rates, meaning that we would pay the same  amount for the money that was borrowed from the Treasury.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the other money that has been included in this Budget is the cashback from the sale of  Civil Service properties under Workplace 2010. We do not yet know how  much we will have to pay above the base rate for that money. Does the Member not accept that the people of Northern Ireland  will pay more for that additional money than they would previously have paid?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Are we getting more money or are we not getting more money? The fact is that  more resources are coming through. Furthermore, we will not have to impose  additional taxation on people in Northern Ireland for the right to  access that money.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Just in case anyone ever watches what goes on in the Assembly and, if they do,  is so demented that they believe the Member  for East Antrim Mr Beggs, let us make it clear that under Workplace  2010, the &pound;200 million will come directly to us. It is not being borrowed. It is going directly into the accounts of  Northern Ireland plc to be used by us. It is money in our pockets that does not  have to be paid back.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I appreciate the Minister of Finance and Personnel keeping me right on the  matter; I did not know that.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, we are hearing a refinement on the argument about  the size of the public sector. Yesterday, the Member for East Belfast Ms Purvis  made an economically illiterate speech in which she seemed to say that  government in Northern    Ireland is not big enough and that she  wanted bigger government. She should join the Khmer Rouge &mdash; &ldquo;Pol Pot Purvis&rdquo;  might be a more appropriate name for her.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry spoke the same language today. He tells us that it  is not that the public sector is too big, but that the private sector is too  small. He does not realise that in all economics such choices must be made. He  should have attended my economics classes when I was teaching production  possibility curves. I could have explained it to him in diagrammatic form.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The truth of the matter is that in order to redirect  resources from one activity to another, there are choices to make. Those  choices have to be made in this Budget. That is where the Member for South Belfast, the Minister of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety, who intervened as a Back Bencher today, got it all wrong. He  said that resources can be redirected, but he did not tell us how. He is right:  we can move from one resource allocation to another, but he did not tell us who  he wants to take the money from. He said only that the people of Northern Ireland  deserve better.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The people of Northern   Ireland deserve better than a Minister who is getting 51%  of the increase of all the money coming into Northern Ireland over the next  three years but who says that he cannot manage. The people of Northern    Ireland deserve better than a Minister  who, having been presented with a report saying that &pound;400 million in savings  can be made in his Department immediately, will not look for those savings.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The people of Northern Ireland deserve far better  than a Minister whose Department absorbs the biggest part of the Northern  Ireland Budget, yet who still holds out the begging bowl. They deserve far  better than a Minister who wants to pillage everyone else&rsquo;s budgets without  dealing with his own. Perhaps the best thing that he could do to give the  people of Northern Ireland  a better deal is to resign and let the Member for North Down who wanted the  Department in the first place take over.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. People have placed enormous faith in  Members. They have elected us to bring an end to the nightmare years of direct  rule, when Ministers with no interest in this place flew in, made decisions  that changed our lives and flew out again. Those decisions were usually bad  ones that left a legacy of neglect and underinvestment.  Those Ministers also showed arrogance when dealing with locally elected  politicians.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">To put right the legacy with which we have been left will  require our adopting an imaginative approach. Although there are many issues  that can be considered absolute priorities, we will inevitably have to take  responsibility for dealing with the burden with which we have been left.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">When we examine the Assembly&rsquo;s list of priorities, we all  shout for our own corner. We have our own priorities, and we hope that the  Minister will look favourably on our particular issue.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I argued in the House yesterday that the promises contained  in the draft Programme for Government and draft investment strategy did not  contain the resources necessary to deal with  the housing crisis in the immediate or long term. I said that, over the  next 15 years, a well-funded, well-resourced and well-thought-out strategy was  required to allow us to plan the type of communities in which we want to live.  It is not simply about building houses in isolation but about building  communities, including mixed-tenure housing, with the infrastructure to develop  and prosper. That requires a commitment from the Executive to plan, finance and  develop the communities of the future. From the draft Budget to the final  Budget, we will sow the seeds of the future. There is an expectation that we  will deliver what is necessary to help the hard-pressed first-time buyers on to  the property ladder through creating an effective affordability sector.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We must fulfil our promises of delivering for the  social-housing sector, which has been decimated over the years. Some parts of  the North have had no new social housing in many years. It is essential that at  least 2,500 new homes be built every year  for the foreseeable future in order to deal with the legacy of neglect.  In 1971, the Housing Executive built 9,500 houses, yet the Minister for Social  Development told us that no new social housing may be built next year.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than blame everyone else, the Minister for Social  Development must trawl her own budget to ensure that she maximises her  resources. She must ensure that there is no wastage in her Department. She is the Minister; she must show the leadership that  comes with her title rather than place the blame elsewhere for the  problems that fall within her remit. That is what leadership is about.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Finance and Personnel mentioned yesterday  that additional resources that the Minister for Social Development has at hand  would allow her to deal with some of the issues facing her Department. Will  Minister of Finance and Personnel comment further on that?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I deal with people who  have been in hostels for years. They  have little prospect of being housed, because they happen to live in  areas of high demand. The housing selection scheme cannot help them, because  they need 180 points or more to compete with another 10 people for the same  two-bedroom house. Do we tell those people that we are sorry, but we do not  have the money to build them a home? What about elderly people who live in a  flat or house that is totally unsuited to their needs, or people with  disabilities who need their homes specially adapted? The social-development  budget has been slashed due to lack of funding. Do we tell those people that we  are sorry, but we cannot help them? Real people are being affected by the  decisions that we make. That is the harsh reality of setting budgets. The  Housing Executive has told us &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go ahead.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>: Cash and land is being made available to the Minister for  Social Development, but she has not even looked at the cash assets of many  housing associations. She has given me 15 reasons why she cannot touch them but  not one reason why she can. If she added all those sources of money together,  the housing programme could be delivered.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  That is one of the difficulties that we face. The Minister for Social  Development has been blaming everyone else, instead of trying to deal with the  situation.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Sammy, it is a fact of life that, as well as that money, at  least another &pound;300 million a year would be needed to start to deal with the  severe housing crisis. A mixture of both is required. Obviously, assets exist,  but a new injection of resources and finance is needed to deal with the  situation.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We have been told by the Housing Executive and the Minister for Social Development that the  adaptations programme is another  programme that will be impacted on because there is no new money to  support it. Could the Minister of Finance and Personnel please comment on that?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The community sector has always been the victim of cuts at  Budget time. Given that that sector provides a much-needed service in the  community and shows huge commitment and dedication to the most deprived areas  of the North, it is shameful that, when money becomes scarce, the community  sector is the first to suffer as a result of departmental cuts. Such cuts have  a knock-on effect on the community that the sector serves. As ever, it is the  weakest in the community who ultimately pay the price.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We owe a debt of gratitude to the community sector; it runs  the youth clubs, the cr&egrave;ches, the community houses, the outreach programmes,  services for the old and the young, to name but a few. We should ensure that  funding for such projects continues rather than allow them to become the  victims of cutbacks.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I am not sure whether Mr McGimpsey spoke as  an ordinary MLA or as a Minister when he delivered his speech on health,  but I regret that I missed it. I had a  meeting with a group of women from the Rape Crisis and Sexual Abuse  Centre in Belfast. That group of ladies require immediate funding if their  organisation is to survive; it is in crisis. It provides a unique service to  all women, and, indeed men, across Northern Ireland who experience  rape, abuse or sexual violence in their lifetime.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Each year, the centre deals with approximately 6,000 calls  &mdash; to and from clients &mdash; about sexual violence and abuse. Some 55% of the  centre&rsquo;s clients have experienced child sexual abuse. Each year, nearly 2,000  new clients contact the centre, and nearly half of them will visit the centre  at least once. The centre requires mainstream funding, and it is essential that  the Rape Crisis and Sexual Abuse Centre be allowed to continue its important  work of providing care for those who are in deep crisis. That work cuts across  many departments and areas, including health, education and social development,  and I appeal for that money to be found in the various Departments, if at all  possible.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As party spokesperson on health, the bulk of my remarks  will refer to the health sector. Although I welcome the strong economic focus  in the draft Programme for Government and draft Budget, I am also encouraged  that health has obtained such a large slice of the overall resource cake. I am  keen to see the maximum amount of resources directed towards health, and no  doubt we could always make use of more. However, it is clear from the  proportion of the Budget that has been allocated to health and social services  &mdash; about half of the resources available &mdash; that a strong emphasis has been  placed on health.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I hear the calls for greater allocations for social housing  and other worthy causes. I recognise the merit of those calls, but I hope that  that will not lead to the draft Budget&rsquo;s percentage of spend on health being  reduced in the final Budget.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I want to see a better Health Service, not an increas&shy;ingly  expensive one. Improving productivity is the key and will ensure that the  public get the maximum out of the service for the money going into it.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>: I appreciate and understand everything that the Member has  said. However, does she not also agree that housing is a cross-cutting issue?  If people do not have a house, it impacts on their health, education and  employment possibilities. A holistic approach is needed to deal with this  matter.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention, and I could not agree more that health  is not simply a stand-alone issue. It is a cross-sectoral issue, which involves  other Departments and impacts on recreation and leisure, and so on. I will come  to that point if I am allowed to move on.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Transformation, which would increase productivity, cannot be put off indefinitely. Radical reform is  essential. There must be innovation  and incentives. The resignation of David Sissling, chief executive  designate of the new health authority, is exactly the sort of development of  which I have been fearful. It was a coup for Northern Ireland to have attracted  someone of David Sissling&rsquo;s calibre to the local Health Service. However, it  was inevitable that he would not hang around forever while the Minister delayed  his getting on with his work. I fear that unless there is swift progress on  health reform, others could follow Mr Sissling. General practitioners and other  health professionals who are involved in local commissioning groups are also  being denied the opportunity to get on with their work.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have a strong interest in mental-health issues, as do  other members of the Health Committee. The Committee is determined to see the  recommendations of the Bamford Review of Mental Health and Learning Disability  implemented quickly. The Committee was somewhat surprised to learn that the  Minister made one upfront bid for mental health to DFP, for &pound;12 million, and  then mental health did not feature again until his seventeenth bid. Even more  surprisingly, some of the plans contained in the two bids, referred to as  &ldquo;Bamford 1&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bamford 2&rdquo;, appear to have little to do with the vision and  thrust of the Bamford Review. The Bamford Review was about redirecting  resources from the acute sector into the community. However, the bids included  the building of new facilities and autism issues, despite the fact that the  autism lobby has argued strongly that autism should be considered separate and  distinct from mental health and learning disability.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Incidentally, it has proved difficult for Committee members  to obtain information on figures. Details of the figures have been slow to come  &mdash; emerging in just a trickle. In response to the gentleman from East Antrim, the Committee has not been able to obtain  comparable figures or historic evidence of how bids have been pitched, or of  the basis on which that was done. Perhaps he will take the time to seek that  information from his colleague, who is the Minister at fault, instead of sniping at other Department&rsquo;s Ministers.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  No, I will not give way. The Member has spoken enough.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is essential that mental health feature prominently in  new service development. The many millions that have already been devoted to  mental health in the draft Budget, when added to the extra funding, must be  channelled towards the redirection of services.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Another concern is mental-health provision for the  Province&rsquo;s prisoners. The Assembly deserves answers on how that is to be  funded, now that funding has been transferred from the Northern Ireland Office  to the Health Department. There is already a huge need for mental-health  resources without prison services having to be funded from the same pot.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Since the Chairman of the Health Committee got  up to speak, the Member for Strangford Mr McNarry has been sitting having a  conversation with his back to the Chamber. Clearly, he wants to show his  disrespect for the Member who is speaking. That should not be allowed in the  Chamber.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind all Members to have respect for one another in the Chamber, whether  they are speaking or sitting.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Speaker. Do you agree that it is appropriate that Members  should speak through the Chair, rather than  directly to other Members?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have already made that point. The Member did speak through the Chair.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I ask Mrs Robinson to continue.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I must say that the Assembly becomes more  and more like a pantomime, Mr Speaker. However, what can one expect?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I want to know whether additional money has been resourced  &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor. Let us have some respect.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have called for order. The Member may continue.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  For the third time, Mr Speaker, I want to ascertain whether the Northern  Ireland Office will be providing the Health Department with the additional  money that is necessary for the well-being and mental health of prisoners as  part of the holistic approach to mental health.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mental health must be considered holistically, and  responsibility for it lies with other Departments as well as the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety. The Department of Education can play  a role, particularly in relation to the promotion of good mental health and the  delivery of aspects of the Bamford Review recommendations on child and  adolescent mental health. Many other sectors can play a role in improving the  overall well-being of the community. I welcome the investment from the  Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure to promote leisure and exercise. That  shows the potential that can be gained from having more co-ordinated  government.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Over the weekend, I was surprised to hear the Health  Minister seek to blame the draft Budget for the delay in building the new  women&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s hospital in Belfast.  It was only last week at a draft Budget  briefing that his departmental officials informed the Committee for  Health, Social Services and Public Safety that their Department had done well  in respect of the capital allocations that it had received in the draft Budget.  Who does one believe? With regard to the children&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s hospital, it  remains to be seen how far up the Minister&rsquo;s priority list that is, and whether  there are other projects that he would like to see completed first. Given that  the Jubilee Maternity  Hospital on the Belfast City   Hospital site was forced  to close, it is essential that the new regional centre be delivered promptly.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, will I be allowed extra time because of the  interference during my contribution?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  No.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  The Health Committee was also interested to learn that the departmental  officials were going to reassess some of the bids that were made to the  Department of Finance and Personnel, which were originally referred to as  inescapable or unavoidable. We have been informed by the Department of Health  that some of their inescapables may not have been inescapable. Strange though  that may appear, it will at least allow more funding to be made available for  new service development than had been indicated, and that will be welcomed by  everyone. It would be welcome if that funding could be utilised for mental  health.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I shall speak in a personal capacity, before  moving on to business relating to the Department of Culture, Arts and  Leisure. This is a debate; it is what Members do in the Chamber. Yesterday, we  had a debate &mdash; opinions were offered, and most were respectfully listened to.  The Assembly reached a decision by a democratic vote, but the Finance Minister  then rode in with a spurious points of order, which was not a point of order.  The Robinsons are not having much success with point of order lately. Last  night&rsquo;s point of order was used to issue a warning or a veiled threat. The  timing and the intention of that have not been lost on the Ulster Unionist  Party.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday, almost every Department was criticised over the  draft Programme for Government &mdash; and if you  think differently, read Hansard. However, following the debate, there  was no recognition of what was said during  it; instead, we received a Darth Vader impression, warning that the Executive will fall without a  Programme for Government. Now try that on, and it would be a signal to  the Committees and to the House to pack up and go back to our constituency  offices because remote control has returned, and all decision making will begin and end with the Executive &mdash;  even draft consultative issues are not to be discussed in case anyone  responds with constructive opposition.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Last night&rsquo;s intervention came from a Member who, only a  while ago, was not even going to enter an Executive, let alone an Executive  with terrorists. However, only a short time ago, after claiming the credit for  first mooting the idea of the need for a financial package in Dublin, the Member said that an adequate financial package was a necessary  precondition for any restoration of devolution. That view was backed to  the hilt by the Chairman of the Committee for Finance and Personnel, Mr  McLaughlin, who said that the Government should put their money where their  mouth is and give us the chance to deliver a Programme for Government, and not  destroy our work before we start.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In February of this year, the &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo; quoted a DUP  source as saying that the financial package was a &ldquo;deal breaker&rdquo;, and that if  the money for devolution was not right, there would be no Government. The  source also stated that there was no point in setting up a Government to fall,  and that if problems with water rates, hospitals, education, and roads were to  be truly addressed, that could only be done properly with the appropriate  financial package.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have a litany of DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in statements and  promises, but I cannot find evidence that either party has lived up to any of  them. Are Members here to consult, through positive debate, on the draft  Budget, or is this a sitting that is likely to decide the future of the  Executive?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Of course it is not, because it is a draft Budget, and  control freakery and ministerial codes cannot be used to restrict any Member  from voicing his or her opinion in the Assembly. Ulster Unionists are not in a  coalition: we are in an Executive as of right. Yesterday &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  The Ulster Unionists are part of a mandatory coalition.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Mandatory coalitions: now someone is trying to &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Yesterday, the First Minster told the House that the draft Programme for  Government will be subjected to lengthy and full consultation. In contrast to  other members of his party, he did not address the debate &mdash; amid the voices of  argued opposition &mdash; from a position that the draft Programme for Government was  not a draft at all.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister of Finance and Personnel now stating that  the full import of opposing views will not be considered as part of the  consultation process? The First Minister&rsquo;s approach to the debate was fair and  balanced. He told Members of his vision, and he performed with the dignity that  one associates with his high office. I suspect that, in marked contrast, the  Minister of Finance and Personnel may be unable to match yesterday&rsquo;s  performance by the First Minister, which would be regrettable.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, no one who spoke in today&rsquo;s debate wanted to end  up on the receiving end of personal abuse. The point is that the Ulster  Unionist Party wants to analyse the draft Budget. We are striving to help by  improving the draft Budget and making it more acceptable. I understand and  appreciate the attitude of the DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in coalition that Departments must  make do with what they have been allocated. However, the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in have ownership of that comment, not the  UUP. It will be up to them to explain why they did not tell the electorate that  they would have to make do with much less than the minimum that people would  have expected or are likely to tolerate. Let us see how it all works out.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">From this point on, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure. The  Committee carefully considered the allocations to the Department of  Culture, Arts and Leisure in the draft Budget, and it has several serious concerns,  because it has received no information on how the allocations to arts, sports,  and so forth, will be spent. It is particularly difficult for the Committee to  comment constructively on the draft Budget when it does not know which projects  will be funded and which will not.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, the draft Budget&rsquo;s allocation to the Department of  Culture, Arts and Leisure is small and inadequate. DCAL suffers from the legacy  that Government have consistently undervalued the contribution that culture,  arts and leisure makes to all sectors of society. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  The Committee calls for an increase across the board in the Department&rsquo;s  budget.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is disappointed that the draft Budget does  not bridge the gap in arts funding with the rest of the United Kingdom.  I reiterate that I am speaking on behalf of the Committee, whose report I have  been asked to deliver to the House. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, Members, please.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. In the past two minutes of the debate, there  have been four utterances from Mr Donaldson, three from Mr Sammy Wilson, three  from Mr Robinson &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have the Floor, because I am making a point of order. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>: In  the past two minutes, there have been utterances from four DUP Members on 10  different occasions &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  He only mentioned three of us.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  On 10 different occasions &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Mr Speaker, on one occasion when you sat down after asking for order, Sammy  Wilson immediately uttered more comments in the direction of the Member who was  speaking. Given the catalogue of outbursts, mutterings and various other  comments, I suggest that some Members need to learn the standards of the House.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I have continually said that debates will, on occasions, raise issues.  That is understandable, as this is a debating Chamber. However, I remind  Members to have respect for one another. That is vital.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  The Committee is disappointed that the draft Budget does not bridge the gap in  per capita funding for the arts with the rest of the United   Kingdom &mdash; Northern Ireland  receives substantially less, per head of the population, than other United Kingdom  regions. The Committee believes that that will make life very difficult for the  Arts Council in its distribution of limited funding. The Arts Council has  raised a concern that the draft Budget settlement for the arts will put as many  as 200 full-time and part-time jobs at risk. Over 25,000 participants from  across Northern Ireland  may be denied access to outreach activities and engagements with the arts. That  must be looked at.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is also concerned about the effect that the  loss of the children&rsquo;s and young people&rsquo;s fund will have on the creative  learning centres in Londonderry and Belfast.  The children&rsquo;s fund currently provides those centres with 50% of their funding.  The centres are involved in huge projects that make a difference in their  communities. Are we going to tell those groups to forget about it, make all  their staff redundant and start afresh? Surely we cannot allow that to happen.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is concerned that the Department will not be  able to deliver on its targets for increasing the participation of young people  in sport. Although it is at a local level that young people participate in  sport, there is no provision for a capital  spend on community-based infrastructure. Therefore, the Committee is  more than disappointed that there has not  been more emphasis put on community sport and assistance for local  sports clubs in the ongoing work that they  do with young people.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has allocated capital funding to elite  facilities, such as the 50-metre swimming pool and the multi-sports stadium,  with the intention that they will be used in connection with the 2012 Olympics.  However, the Committee has deep concerns about the lasting legacy that the  Olympic Games will give Northern    Ireland. What does &ldquo;a lasting legacy&rdquo; mean? The Committee asks the Sports Minister and the  Finance Minister whether Northern    Ireland will have a multi-sports stadium by  2012.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Just over half of the DCAL budget will be spent on  libraries and museums &mdash; almost twice the amount that will be spent on sport and  the arts. The Minister has previously explained that arts and sports are lucky  as they can rely on large numbers of volunteers, whereas libraries and museums require paid staff. The  Committee does not accept that as an argument for underfunding in sport  and the arts. Volunteers should not be treated as poor relations or taken for  granted.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee welcomes the &pound;21 million that is to be  allocated to the building of a new home for the Public Record Office (PRONI).  Given its location in the Titanic Quarter, there is significant tourism  potential from people who come to Northern Ireland to investigate  their roots. That spend will contribute to the wider economy. However, the  Committee recommends that there be additional funding to enhance the visitor  experience at PRONI.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  have listened to what the Member has said, and I am encouraged. Given that one  of his colleagues has asked for an extra &pound;600 million, can the Member identify  where we can get additional funds? I think that if money were taken from the  Health budget and put towards recreation, for example, further savings could be  made in health. Will the Member support that?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I am sure that if the Minister had been in the House yesterday &mdash; maybe he was,  but did not hear me &mdash; he would know that I referred to that very succinctly, in  that it is a wish of the Committee, and he should know that from the Committee  &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr McGlone)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. I am presenting the response of the Environment Committee to  the draft Budget 2008-11. The Committee notes that the draft Budget sets out  the proposed spending plans of the Executive for that period, and I will  specifically refer to what the Budget addresses as the relevant key issues. In  regard to road safety, these are road casualty reductions, road transport  compliance and enforcement, and reduction of vehicle-related crime and carbon  emissions.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the key issues for the Environment and <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">Heritage Service are: enhanced environmental  protection</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">and improvement through  better regulation; the establish&shy;ment</span> of  a dedicated environmental crime team to combat the illegal dumping of  waste; the establishment of a new strategic development and delivery support  team to co-ordinate cross-cutting regulation activities; and implementation of  air-quality management.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, the programme delivery support unit&rsquo;s key <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">area will be the support of district councils and  the three</span> waste-management groups in  implementing major waste procurement plans.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Fourthly, the Department will be able to develop, in part,  an agreed programme for the modernisation and structure reform of local  government.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the proposed capital allocations will provide  funding to district councils to cover a percentage of the overall costs  associated with compliance with the EU landfill directive targets.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">Under the reform  programme, the draft Budget states</span> that the Department intends to take  forward further reform of the Planning Service and that the allocation will also enable the review of environmental  governance to be progressed. That  will address the structure, manage&shy;ment and resourcing of the publicly  funded elements of the environmental  governance system in central Govern&shy;ment and local government, and  implement proposals for the future environmental governance arrangements in  relation to environmental protection, and natural and built heritage.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Is it the case that there is no provision made in the draft Budget for the  creation of an environmental protection agency?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>: I can confirm to the Member that that question was asked of  officials during the Committee&rsquo;s deliberations on the draft Budget, and they  confirmed that there was no provision. That  is a matter for concern to those of us who support that project and wish  to see it implemented as soon as possible.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee notes  that the allocations received in the draft Budget largely meet the  following spending proposals and bids: road  safety services &mdash; &pound;4&middot;55 million <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">required  for other resources and &pound;3&middot;3 million for administ&shy;ration</span> over the priorities and Budget period; enforcement  and better regulation of EHS &mdash; &pound;1&middot;53 million required for other  resources and &pound;3&middot;4 million for administration over the priorities and Budget  period; programme delivery support unit (PDSU) &mdash; &pound;2 million required over the  priorities and Budget period.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee notes, however, that the following spending  proposals and bids were not met: planning reform &mdash; &pound;0&middot;55 million required for  other resources and &pound;2&middot;5 million for administration over the priorities and  Budget period; review of public administration covering the costs incurred by  the Planning Service and the local government reform unit (LGRU) in taking  forward the RPA agenda &mdash; &pound;13&middot;55 million required for other resources and &pound;4&middot;55  million for administration over the priorities and Budget period; LGRU &mdash; &pound;13  million required for other resources and &pound;1&middot;7 million for administration over  the priorities and Budget period; local  government division &mdash;&pound;2&middot;4 million required  for other resources over the priorities and Budget period; waste and  contamination land &mdash; &pound;3&middot;7 million required for other resources and &pound;0&middot;83  million for administration over the priorities and Budget period. The Committee  has particular concerns about the shortfalls in the spending proposals  regarding the costs associated with  implementing the RPA recommendations.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for the Environment welcomes the additional  funding of &pound;3&middot;8 million over the three-year Budget period for enhanced roadside  enforcement and of &pound;4&middot;1 million for enforcement and better regulation of  environmental protection.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Committee recommends that extra resources should be used to benefit one, or more,  aspects of the ASSI programme. That  could include an increase in the number of ASSI declarations made each  year in order to complete the priority  designations before 2016, and a  quicker response rate on consent applications. That would lead, in turn,  to greater progress in achieving favourable conditions for features in  designated sites, and more robust protection and enforcement measures,  particularly with regard to Natura 2000 sites.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the Budget efficiencies, the Committee is  concerned that in order to deliver the administration savings in the final  year, 2010-11, the Department of the Environment may have to suppress up to 300  posts, even after a board decision to reduce  non-salary running costs by 15%.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In that regard, we are  particularly concerned that there will  be a detrimental impact on service delivery, partic&shy;ularly in certain  low-priority areas of the Environment and  Heritage Service. Committee members are concerned about the proposed cutbacks to the EHS budget,  and the impact that those cuts will have on training, resources and  investment, which, of themselves, are important in providing for enforcement  and investigation in respect of illegal dumping.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Committee members expressed widespread concern at the  proposed efficiency savings of &pound;1&middot;1 million in relation to the Planning  Service, and how that could equate with &mdash;  and be incorporated into &mdash; any mean&shy;ingful reform of the service.  Although the Committee is aware of the intention of the Minister to reform the  planning process, it acknowledges that the Planning Service is facing very  significant structural reform arising from the review of public administration.  Concerns have already been expressed about those budgetary allocations.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Department&rsquo;s additional funding of &pound;4&middot;4 million in the  2008-09 financial year includes &pound;2&middot;2 million for the Planning Service, which, in the main, will go towards staff  costs. However, the Committee recommends that similar amounts be allocated to  the Department in the final two Budget years, 2009-10 and 2010-11. That is  particularly relevant, given that that is the anticipated transition time for  the review of public administration.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Committee for the Environment,  I thank you for calling me and for giving me the opportunity to engage in the  process and debate this matter with colleagues.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  In respect of planning, does the Member agree that one of the most serious  deficiencies is the forward planning of bypasses around towns? I refer particularly to Dungiven, which now has the  distinction of being the most polluted town in these islands. Does the  Member agree that waiting until 2015 for a bypass for Dungiven is unacceptable,  and is only one year short of the predicted united Ireland that we have been told  about?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  That certainly represents the green agenda. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Member for his intervention. Invariably,  although that matter strays a wee bit into the remit of the Department for  Regional Development &mdash; and the bypass is  clearly an issue for that Minister &mdash; there may well be environmental  concerns that relate to the remit of the Committee for the Environment. I will  welcome any further comments and details from the Member in due course, and  they will certainly be investigated.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  After listening to Mr McNarry, I wonder what type of a debate I am taking part  in. I know that he will not leave, now that I have mentioned him. I was  interested in what he had to say, but I could not figure out whether he was  talking about the Budget or something else.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry said that the Department of Culture, Arts and  Leisure and the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety did not have enough money. It is interesting to note  that one of those Departments is currently run by his party&rsquo;s Minister, and the  other Department was once run by the same individual. I do not know what that  says about that individual, or what Mr McNarry is trying to tell us. However,  if I heard the Minister of Finance and Personnel correctly yesterday, he said  that the Department of Health, Social Services and Public has as much money as  all the other Depart&shy;ments put together &mdash; but still we are told that there is  not enough to do the job.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">That begs the question: what would it take to satisfy the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety if he has as much as all the other 10 Departments put  together and finds that that is still not enough? He has over 48% of the  Budget, and he has been given an increase of over 51%. How much money will it  take?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to Mr McGimpsey earlier, and I thought that it  was ironic that &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I will give way in a moment or two. I thought it ironic that the Minister  looked like a man who was just about to throw in the towel and walk away,  instead of saying that he wanted to do the job and wanted to get on with it.  The Ulster Unionists must learn the lesson that when you are in something, you  are in it &mdash; you cannot just be in it when there is good news. They tell us that  this Government is a Sinn F&eacute;in/DUP carve up. However, they never seem to  realise that their Ministers are also in the Government alongside one from the  SDLP.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Does the Member agree with Mrs Robinson that:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Costs cannot be the driving force for our emergency  services. We must all support the amendment if we are to send a clear message  to Government that less is bad.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Bound Volume 21, p113, col  2].</span></span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Morrow</strong>: I  am not sure what amendment the Member is  referring to. Perhaps, he might clarify quickly.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Mrs Robinson was criticising cuts in the  Fire Service, which, as the Member knows, come under the health budget  and which she thought were not a good idea. There is no mention of that in the  forthcoming Budget. Is less bad?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I think you are missing the point, Mr McCrea. The Health Minister&rsquo;s budget is  not being cut &mdash; he is getting more. I do not know if that fact has dawned on you. Perhaps you should take time to  consider the figures to ascertain where you are coming from. Frankly,  you have lost the rest of us. We do not know where  you are, and I suspect that you have lost yourself. If you still wish to  contribute to the debate, I suspect that it will be worth listening to &mdash; or, on  second thoughts, maybe not.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Returning to what I wanted to say, the Minister of Finance  and Personnel touched the right note in the foreword to the draft Budget:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We need to use our public resources wisely to deliver  to deliver high quality public services, especially to the young, the old and  other vulnerable members of our community.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I want to direct most of my comments towards two of  those groups &mdash; the young and the elderly. I  believe that a society that does not  look after both of those categories of people will be found to have been  neglectful and will be judged accordingly.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In our community, there individuals who, for one reason or  another, are in a vulnerable position, which can  be due to their being young, elderly, infirm, disabled or disadvantaged.  Of those groups, I wish to focus specifically on two &mdash; the young who, as  tomorrow&rsquo;s adults, start their lives requiring nurturing, protection and  guidance, and the elderly, who find that they are that bit weaker or infirm.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">During their early, tender, formative years, children are  entirely reliant upon adults. Parents or guardians provide them with a safe  environment, and schools guide them in education and all-important life skills  while they are growing.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">A child develops its own  mind and begins to formulate opinions &mdash; albeit in a fairly simplistic  sense &mdash; during the years up to the age of six. That is when they take in  information that will assist them in the future. Not surprisingly, that part of  a child&rsquo;s life is known as the formative years. Therefore, it is crucial that  that relatively short time span is afforded the highest level of dedicated care  and education in order to ensure that all potential is well on the way to being  realised.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">On Tuesday 26 June 2007, I tabled a motion to consider making available a transformation fund,  similar to that which is available in  England, Scotland and Wales,  in order to support the professional development of the childcare and early  education workforces in Northern    Ireland. That would be of tremendous benefit to Northern<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> </span>Ireland&rsquo;s future generation, and has the scope to  improve children&rsquo;s  later-childhood outcomes and their adult lives.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Currently, in Northern Ireland, staff who work in  community or voluntary pre-schools must pay for their ongoing training and  professional development, and there is a significant disparity between their  pay levels and those of people in the statutory sector.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am deeply concerned that there is no training or  development strategy whatsoever for people who work with young children. The Assembly must take cognisance of that  issue.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is essential that we appropriately equip the childcare  and early-years education workforce for the delivery of positive children&rsquo;s  services to ensure better outcomes and reduce inequalities for children, young  people, families and communities.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to matters affecting elderly people in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for giving way,  and for his interest in issues involving young people. However, does he  agree that it is inconceivable that the children&rsquo;s fund has been done away  with? The result of that is that many of the Home Start schemes throughout the  country, which are largely staffed by volunteers, will be under threat from 30  March 2008. Does the Member agree that the Executive should consider that  matter and ensure that Home Start provision continues?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I listened carefully to what the Member said, but he will be aware that that  decision was taken by direct rule Ministers. I have no doubt that that is the type of issue that the Executive and  Assembly must give thought to and expend energy on. I could not agree  more with the Member that we must deal with that type of issue, but Rome was not built in a  day. Nonetheless, we will return to those issues.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Many factors can make senior citizens vulnerable: their  health and general fitness can deteriorate; they do not have the energy that  they once had; and they are susceptible to  illness, as their immune systems weakens. Basically, they find themselves &mdash; as will we all, one day &mdash; not  as robust as they were when they were younger.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Bad weather can make  outdoor conditions treacherous, and some senior citizens prefer to  remain at home in the colder months. The Assembly has a duty to ensure that our  senior citizens, who are valuable members of the community, remain safe, secure  and comfortable in their homes. Keeping  those homes adequately warm and damp-free  is a major step towards improving the quality of life of senior citizens. Those positive outcomes reflect well  for the individual and for the wider community.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Eradicating cold and damp is of tremendous benefit in  warding off illness, particularly for people who suffer from breathing  complications caused by coughs, influenza and bronchitis. In the worst-case  scenario, those conditions can develop into pneumonia, which is a drastic  illness at any age.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to bring to the Assembly&rsquo;s attention an issue that  is dear to my heart: the warm homes scheme. That scheme was introduced in 2001  by a Minister who shall remain nameless &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is just about up.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I regret that. I gave way because I thought that I might get a few extra  minutes.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I wish to concentrate on the  education and further-education Budget allocations. However, first, I believe  that a Member from the unofficial Opposition, the  Alliance Party, referred earlier to Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s &ldquo;legacy Budget&rdquo;.  Although there is a legacy of the decisions taken by direct rule Ministers, it  is very much the Executive&rsquo;s Budget. It sets strategic priorities that are  clearly more challenging and far reaching than any that were set by the  previous Executive under the tutelage of the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist  Party. Whatever else the Executive might be accused of, it cannot be accused of  merely tinkering with the inherited, direct rule status quo.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The education and further-education budgets have been a key  priority for the Executive. Investment in the education and development of our  young people will make a major contribution to the economy, and economic growth  will provide opportunities for all young people to prepare for life and work.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The education sector &mdash; including the Department of  Education, and the Department for Employment and Learning &mdash; faces significant  challenges in the years ahead. All sectors are undergoing radical reforms and  changes to meet the needs of the twenty-first century. Improving educational  standards in all of those sectors is a key priority for the Executive. We want  our education system to deliver equal opportunities for every young person and  adult to learn and succeed. The best opportunities for everyone, from the very  young to those who return to further education in later years, needs to be the hallmark of our education system.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Many changes are currently under way, particularly in the  primary and post-primary sectors. The revised curriculum  gives young people an improved start in life, with a greater emphasis on  developing their skills and the need for life and work experiences. The  entitlement framework provides post-primary pupils with greater access to a  range of academic, vocational and technical subjects.  I have no doubt that the Minister of Education will soon announce  proposals regarding transfer arrangements from primary to post-primary schools.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  am glad that the Member has some insight on  the issue of the Education Minister&rsquo;s bringing forward proposals for a  replacement of the transfer system. It is regrettable that the Minister is not  as forthcoming on the issue.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Member agree that, if, as he has said, the  priority for education is to deliver, it is incumbent on the Minister of  Education to prove that she is capable of making decisions that can deliver?  The Member is aware that in recent  correspondence with the Committee for Education, the Minister was unable  to outline her priorities because she had not made any decisions. Obviously,  there is an issue in respect of learning on the behalf of the Minister of  Education.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>: I thank the Member for that. The Minister of Education will  bring proposals to this Chamber and to the Executive in the not-too-distant  future. It will then be a matter for the  Assembly and for the Committee for Education &mdash; which Mervyn Storey sits  on &mdash; to debate those proposals.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There are other issues  regarding education, including the primary and post-primary sector, that  the Minister and the Committee for Education have referred to over the past  number of months. The disparity between primary and post-primary schools was  raised by the Minister during a recent meeting.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Early-years provision is a key priority for both the  Committee and the Minister. Early-years provision in education is how we can  address issues so that they do not come home to roost in later years. The  literacy and numeracy strategy crosses the  Department of Education and the  Department for Employment and Learning, and that has been recognised by  the respective Committees as a key priority. If people are to be equipped to go  into the world of work, literacy and numeracy are key skills that they must  have.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the fact that the Irish-medium sector is  being improved, particularly through the club-bank scheme, which was recently  debated. Funding for the teaching of principals, particularly in primary  schools, has been a big issue over the years, and reference has been made to  that in the draft Budget.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Kieran McCarthy raised concerns about funding for children  and young people. The Minister of Education has recognised that issue. If that  funding is to continue, it would have to come out of the Education budget; therefore that has to be a key priority for the  Executive. That is linked to early-years provision, and if that funding  does not continue, it will undermine all the good work that has been done.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Youth-services funding also needs to be considered. Many  people who work in youth services &mdash; which come within the remit of the  Department of Education &mdash; have concerns about funding.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There are a number of concerns in relation to further and  higher education. I am disappointed that tuition fees are still in place. The  Minister referred to a review of tuition  fees early in the new year. However, evidence is emerging that tuition  fees discourage people from taking up further and higher education. They are  linked to maintenance grants, and there is a disparity between the maintenance  grants to students here and those to students in Britain. We are losing out. The  Assembly has yet to debate tuition fees. When that issue came to the Committee,  a vote was taken not to allow fees to increase in line with inflation.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, I am  disappointed that the further education lecturers&rsquo; dispute continues.  The Minister for Employ&shy;ment and Learning  appointed someone to look into that; nevertheless, serious concerns  remain. It is particularly unfortunate that this occurs at a time when colleges  are merging. We look to higher and further  education to bring about a high-quality training and learning  environment to provide skills and people for the workforces of business,  industrial and commercial sectors.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We see significant and  far-reaching changes in further and higher education. The Executive  recognise that investment in those sectors is crucial to the delivery of their vision of a thriving and buoyant economy.  Increasing skill levels and improving participation in education and training  are vital elements in a strong economy, and will play an important role in  economic success. Further and higher education is at the heart of life-long learning and is one of the key priorities of the  Executive.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The loss of jobs at Seagate illustrates the importance of  further and higher education. Low-skilled jobs are vulnerable to overseas  competition. The message to the Executive is clear: we need highly-skilled jobs  which are protected, and therefore not as vulnerable.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In the draft Budget, more remains to be done for education  and further education. There is concern over tuition fees. I am disappointed  that the Minister did not take a more  robust attitude to the recent inquiry into the failure of the Springvale  campus. Given the high levels of deprivation in the area, he should have taken  a more hands-on approach to the achievement  of an educational campus on a site that straddles west and north Belfast. However, there  is much in the draft Budget that is positive for the primary and post-primary  sectors.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">All in all, provision in the draft Budget for both  education and further and higher education allows us an opportunity to deliver  one of the key objectives of the Executive &mdash; a strong, vibrant economy. Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  My first reaction to the draft Budget was extremely positive. The presentation  highlighted the economy, emphasised the need for innovation, the encouragement  of enterprise and the creation of 6,000 highly  paid jobs. In social terms, it rejected water charges, proposed free transport for the over-60s, and it  emphasised the Executive&rsquo;s green credentials with the proposed  introduction of a rapid&ndash;transit system for Belfast.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, as the details emerged, the initial presentation  seemed rather disingenuous. The draft Budget was rather like an Easter egg &mdash;  attractive on the outside, but with little substance and with a great hole in  the middle.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget raises serious questions. It is based on  unrealistic assumptions and party-political considerations and does little to  tackle the real problems facing our economy. That is particularly true in  respect of the environment. Recently the Assembly expressed concern about  climate change and agreed to show leadership in putting sustainable development  at the centre of policy making. There is absolutely no evidence of that in the  draft Budget. The commitment to rapid transit is welcome; however, it has been  under consideration for a least a decade, and the fact that work will not start  until 2011 is disappointing.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Programme for Government proposes reducing the  carbon footprint by 25% by 2025. That is hopeful, but no interim targets are  stated and there is no evidence of any change in policy to meet that target.  Such long-term targets are ineffective and will achieve nothing unless they are  accompanied by changes in policy, which this is not. To achieve the target, we  must get commuters out of their cars and onto public transport, but an  examination of the Department of Rural Development capital investment programme  for the next 10 years shows a ratio of four to one in favour of roads, and that  differential is increasing. If we wish to reduce carbon emissions, we must take  positive action to encourage greater use of public transport. Although such  measures will have little impact on the fight against climate change, they are  better than the contribution from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment, which is to end the reconnect grants and to stop funding the Renewable Energy Installer   Academy. Peter Hain set  up reconnect grants to encourage more householders to install renewable energy  systems, making renewable energy cheaper, easier, and more environmentally  friendly, and reducing the use of fossil fuels.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Not only will that  decision increase carbon emissions, but it is also short-sighted as we  have a growing local renewables industry that will be strangled at birth if the  grants are removed. If the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment is  serious about encouraging the development of new technology, that scheme should  be expanded. As a result of the decision, jobs and skills in new technology  will be lost. Similarly, the decision to reduce funding for home insulation  under the warm homes scheme will greatly increase carbon emissions.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, the draft Budget  seems to be a case of smoke and mirrors. Any increase in expenditure can  be met only by making efficiencies &mdash; the proposal to make efficiencies of 5% in  administration in each of the next five years is extremely optimistic. If those  efficiencies are not achieved, the draft Budget commitments cannot be met; if  they are met, thousands of jobs will be lost, as the public sector is  labour-intensive. That is not mentioned in  the draft Budget, nor is there any indication whether it will mean  compulsory redundancies.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The public welcome for the proposals on water charges may  be premature. Overall, there appears to be no savings, with the costs  transferred from one budget to another. The taxpayer will have to meet the same  costs. The main recommendation of the Hillyard  Report is that &pound;109 million should be paid to Northern Ireland Water from the regional rate and that the Roads  Service should pay &pound;25 million for road drainage costs that are met by  Northern Ireland Water at present. I ask the Minister for an assurance that the  &pound;25 million will not come from the existing roads budget, as it is already  under great pressure, and the roads maintenance budget has been severely cut in  recent years.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">That will reduce the amount that Northern Ireland Water has  to raise, but it also means that there will be &pound;134 million less to spend on  other services; that is largely ignored in  the draft Budget, and it could explain why  the Budget increase for the National Health Service is only 2&middot;6%. As a  former member of the Eastern Health and Social Services Board and one who was involved in health for more than 20 years, I am  extremely concerned by the draft  Budget allocation to the National Health Service. An increase of 2&middot;6% is  the lowest that I can recall; it compares with an average of about 8% over the  past five years.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Had a direct rule  Minister presented such an allocation, the Chairperson of the Committee  for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, along with many others, would have protested vigorously, as she did in  response to previous direct rule  allocations. In fact,a 2&middot;6% increase is  equivalent to freezing the budget, when one considers that, due to  demographic pressure, Health Service inflation is higher than normal inflation.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">A freeze, compared to a 4% increase in real terms in England, is totally unacceptable, particularly  since our waiting and trolley lists and  other problems are signific&shy;antly greater than those in England. The  differential in health expenditure between Northern Ireland and England has reduced  significantly in recent years. A recent study has shown that, taking account of  age profile and deprivation levels, the Health Service in Northern Ireland requires 10% more resources per  head than England  due to greater need.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The present differential is approximately 4%. The proposals  for 2008-09 would erode that differential completely.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Department proposes  new programmes to reduce the present  suicide rate, promote healthier ways of living, halt the rise in  obesity, implement the long-delayed Bamford  Review findings and reduce MRSA infections. However, the draft Budget  does not provide the new resources that are  required for any of those programmes. It is suggested that their funding  will be met from 3% efficiency savings in each of the next three years.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Does the Member agree that there are significant savings to be made, or does he  suggest that, because we have done things a certain way in the past, money  should be set aside, without there being a need to make productivity and  efficiency savings?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I was just coming to that. I recall, for example, that when I was a member of  the Eastern Health and Social Services Board, we had great difficulty in  achieving efficiency savings of even 1%. As has been pointed out, there are  efficiencies to be made in the NHS. However, those efficiency savings cannot be  made overnight. The NHS is a massive organisation, so, like an oil tanker that  is changing course, it will take time to make those savings. Restructuring of  the organisation could require the introduction of legislation, and that could  take some years. Given the labour-intensive nature of the NHS, 1,000 job losses  will be required to achieve the 3% efficiency savings. It seems rather strange  to hear of job cuts in the NHS, when we regularly hear about the problems  associated with the scarcity of doctors, nurses and midwives, and so on.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Although the rates freeze is politically attractive, if  healthcare services for the sick and the elderly are reduced in order to pay  for it, that is unacceptable. Is it really a freeze at all when the rates bill  will include a separate charge, of more than 20%, to pay for water?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget lacks substance and is based on unrealistic  assumptions. It will lead to an increase in environmental damage, no  significant improvement in the Health Service, especially for the mentally ill,  and increased hardship for many of the poorest. Therefore, we should look again  at its allocations.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture  and Rural Development (Dr W McCrea)</strong>: I thank you, Mr Speaker, for the  opportunity to address the House on the financial package that has been  outlined in the draft Budget. I speak today as the Chairman of the Committee  for Agriculture and Rural Development. There are many other things that I would  like say, outside of that role, but I am unable to do so because Members are  limited to 10 minutes in which to speak. As Members are dealing with issues  that are complex for the agriculture industry, I feel that it is my duty to  that industry to stick to my brief.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is inevitable that some Members will not be happy with the draft Budget&rsquo;s allocations. We, in the  Committee for Agriculture and Rural  Development, are no different. However, many of our disagreements and  concerns centre not necessarily on the allocation but on the inescapable bids  that the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development formulated. Therefore, I  wish to express my Committee&rsquo;s concerns and lay them before the House.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">At the beginning of October, the Department was presented  with a report from the red meat task force, which painted a most worrying and  depressing picture of that important agricultural sector. The report recommends  that suckler-cow farmers leave the industry altogether; that they diversify  into some, as yet unknown, new business; and that they should use their single  farm payment &mdash; for which they work extremely hard &mdash; to aid that transition.  Many Committee members cannot accept that position as the way forward for the  red-meat sector. As yet, the Department&rsquo;s response has been to do nothing.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Department has indicated that a sum of &pound;100 million is  available under the rural development programme  for diversification schemes. The Committee welcomes that significant  investment.However, this investment was budgeted for, and approved by the EU,  long before the report on the red-meat sector even began, and did not take  account of the serious picture that was painted by that report.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The investment is not just specifically for the suckler-cow  farmer, but is available to anyone in a rural area who presents the Department  with a viable diversification project. The Committee believes that the findings of the red meat task force provide  sufficient evidence to merit an additional and substantial tranche of  moneys. Furthermore, the Committee contends that a broader and more strategic  approach is required in respect of the current state of the red-meat sector to  ensure that the industry thrives in the long term. Action arising out of that  strategic approach could include direct  support to suckler-herd farmers in a scheme similar to that which  operates in the Irish Republic, and a combined producer-processor  retail-departmental approach to the Northern Ireland agriculture  sector.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the Department&rsquo;s administration and resource  budgets. The Committee is content with the level of those budgets and the level  of efficiency savings that are being sought within them. Those budgets deliver  front line services to farming and rural communities that must be maintained in  these times of severe pressure on the agriculture industry. It is hoped that  those efficiencies will not result in any reduced delivery efficiency, although  I am not confident that that will be the case.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is aware  that the Department intends to remove staff from markets and abattoirs  as part of the wider efficiency savings. We  call on the Department to rethink that intention until such times as new  technologies and processes are given the opportunity to bed in.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has grave reservations about the sale of the  entire Crossnacreevy site to fund the farm-nutrient management scheme. The  Committee emphasises that it is pleased to see the funding provided for the  scheme, although it is of the opinion that, unless derogation from the EU to  extend the deadline for the scheme beyond December 2008 is achieved, the budget  of &pound;50 million, with access to an additional &pound;29 million, is too high. That is  due to the inability to gain planning permission for in excess of 2,500  applications, and to find competent builders to undertake the works within that  deadline.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee believes that it is unnecessary to sell the  entire Crossnacreevy site, which is still essential to the agriculture  industry, particularly in the absence of any business case. The Department has  agreed to a sale without presenting a business case either to the Committee or  the Executive.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  I am sorry; I only have 10 minutes. I am sure that the Member would like to  make his own contribution, which, no doubt, will be valuable. I shall continue  on behalf of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has been advised that the sale of the entire  Crossnacreevy site would result in the potential receipt of &pound;200 million, although, again, the Committee has not  been provided with supporting evidence. The Committee is aware, however, that  receipt of that sum is dependent on the site&rsquo;s being included in the Belfast metropolitan area  plan as a development plan. That has not been promised in any shape or form  either.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee further believes that the Department has not  considered alternative options, including the sale of part of the site, that  would be sufficient to provide cover for the requirements of the farm-nutrient  management scheme. The Committee acknowledges and appreciates that the Minister  of Finance and Personnel has promised the funds to aid that scheme, which is  essential to the farming community. Nevertheless, we cannot understand why the  Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development went to the Minister of Finance  and Personnel to ask for &pound;79 million, only to give &pound;200 million back in its  place.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the  Minister of Finance and Personnel, who is very prudent in such matters,  clapped his hands and thought that Christmas had come early. It would mean a potential loss of &pound;121 million for the  agriculture sector, but a gain of &pound;121 million for the Department of  Finance and Personnel. Who would not want such a gift to be handed out to all  the other Departments?</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, that money is coming out of the agriculture  industry at a time when it is absolutely crippled and on its knees. Given the  Department&rsquo;s intention to sell the entire site, the Committee for Agriculture  and Rural Development has suggested that some or all of the additional receipts  could have been used to fund additional programmes to support the agriculture  industry in relation to the findings of the red  meat task force report, which I mentioned previously. In summary, the  Committee does not support that sale on the current basis, because no business  plan or case has been presented to it for examination.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">During yesterday&rsquo;s debate, I called on the Executive and the  Department to reprioritise the targets for TB and brucellosis, which are  currently to reduce incidence levels to 27% and 20% respectively. The Committee  believes that the Department should aim to eradicate those diseases, rather  than reduce their incidence levels. In the financial year 2006-07, the Department spent &pound;22&middot;7million on TB and  approximately &pound;13&middot;5million on brucellosis. The Department has indicated  to the Committee that it has successfully reduced  disease levels over the past few years. However, the Department must  consider whether spending almost &pound;36 million a year represents value for money,  instead of solving the problem by eradicating the disease and taking that money  out of the pot. Prudence dictates that it is better to eradicate the disease.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">My Committee took up many other issues, including animal  health, cost sharing, the wildlife intervention programme and the Agri-Food and  Biosciences Institute. Those issues must be looked at carefully, bearing in  mind that the agriculture industry has faced foot-and-mouth disease,  bluetongue, avian flu, brown rot in potatoes and other major diseases that  threaten the future of the industry in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I wish to deal  specifically with key issues for the Department for Social Development, such as  the provision of warmer homes for the most vulnerable in our society. There is  no reason why the Minister for Social Development cannot reprioritise her  budget to meet stated objectives, such as the eradication of fuel poverty by  2010, which is an unrealistic target that will do nothing but provide false hope to those most in need.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There is special focus on the issue, as it is warm homes  week. I urge the Minister to re-examine her strategies for dealing with the  matter to ensure that the targets can be met within the timeframe that the  Department for Social Development has set.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Finance and Personnel addressed the issue  of warm homes more positively than the Minister  for Social Development, with the consideration of rate relief for homes  with cavity wall and loft insulation. The Minister for Social Development will  operate within a budget containing the efficiency savings within which all  Ministers operate. She is operating within constraints that she agreed could  meet that priority requirement.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">All Ministers must prioritise within their own budgets,  taking the kudos when a project is delivered upon. However, it is not  acceptable to blame everyone else, including  the Executive, of which she is a member, when natural budgetary  constraints come into play.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is time that the Minister realised that she is part of  the Executive. Holding such a position means that she should have the courage  to make key decisions and the initiative to provide leadership, not only to her  Depart&shy;ment, but to the wider community. Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Regional Development (Mr Wells)</strong>: At the  outset, I apologise that the Chairperson of the Committee for Regional  Development, Mr Cobain, has been called away on an urgent matter.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have been asked to deputise on his behalf, so I will  therefore speak on behalf of the Committee for Regional Development. Mr  Speaker, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak today. I also  thank the Committee for Finance and Personnel for co-ordinating the Assembly&rsquo;s response to the draft Budget.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Like other Committees, the Committee for Regional  Development has scrutinised the draft Programme for Government over the past  few weeks. During that time, it has taken evidence, both oral and written, from  a wide range of stakeholders, including the Quarry Products Association; the Inclusive  Mobility and Transport Advisory Committee; Help the Aged; Age Concern; the  Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action; the Federation of Small  Businesses; and the CBI. On behalf of the Committee, I want to thank all those  organisations and individuals who generously placed their time and expertise at  the disposal of the Committee.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Traditionally, Committees have complained that the Budget  allocations for their Departments are too low. Our Committee does not intend to  break with that tradition. We intend to support the Departments&rsquo; calls for  additional resources. In the case of the Department for Regional Development,  the Committee is of the view that, objectively, the allocations for the  Department in the Budget are insufficient to meet the infrastructure, economic,  social and environmental needs of Northern Ireland. For example, spending on transport in Northern Ireland is &pound;65 a head below spending in England, as measured in the year 2005-06. That is against a  backdrop of a much more dispersed pattern of rural settlement.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Funding for road structural maintenance must be adequate,  transparent and secure. That is perhaps the major point that the Committee  wants to make. The allocations of &pound;56 million, &pound;72 million and &pound;70 million for  the next three years are &pound;125 million short of the &pound;110 million per annum  identified in the structural maintenance funding plan as being necessary to  maintain our roads to an acceptable standard. The Committee is also concerned  about the road safety consequences of continued underfunding in that area.  Those risks have been highlighted in the most recent Roads Service annual  report and accounts.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I realise that the inadequate allocations for structural  maintenance are often supplemented with bids in the in-year monitoring rounds.  Of course, Roads Service has been successful in many of those monitoring  rounds. However, the Committee believes that that is not a viable long-term  strategy for funding structural maintenance programmes. The Department is too dependent on being successful in the in-year  monitoring round process. The Committee calls on the Minister and the  Executive to recognise the value for money represented by planned maintenance  and the public-safety risks associated with continued underfunding of the work  in that area.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee further calls for structural maintenance  funding to be ring-fenced and clearly identified for the period of the Budget.  That will allow the industry to make forward plans with confidence and to  invest in developing the capacity required to meet Northern Ireland&rsquo;s structural  maintenance needs on time and within budget.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  Does my honourable friend agree that when the Department for Regional  Development is given such a substantial budget, it is vital that it is spent  wisely? There was a plan for a bypass for Magherafelt. For 30 years, the people  of Magherafelt town have been waiting for that bypass to be built, and we still  do not have it. We thought that we might be in the running to get some movement  on that matter.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, a new plan has now been devised by some civil  servant. Instead of giving us that bypass, the Department for Regional  Development now wants to put that plan on the long finger and build a road that  stretches from the Moneymore road right down to the Castledawson roundabout. If  that is the kind of brains that are in the Department, it is about time that  there was a rethink; the Department is getting too much money instead of too  little. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  am sure that the Committee would wish to support the honourable Member for South Antrim&rsquo;s call for that bypass after the completion  of the Ballynahinch bypass. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span><span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is also concerned about investment in road  infrastructure, which is essential to the social and economic well-being of Northern Ireland.  A good-quality road network is crucial to improving journey times in Northern Ireland  and to connectivity to and from our ports, airports and tourism facilities. In  addition, a substantial amount of public transport is road-based. Access to  health and social services, employment, education and cultural and sporting  activities depends on an adequate, sustainable, safe and effective road  network.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is concerned about the allocation to the  roads capital budget, which, at &pound;572 million, is significantly lower than the  low scenario bid in the draft investment strategy. The current allocation will  allow for the opening of the M1, Westlink and M2 upgrades in 2009. That project  is safe, as is the dualling of the A4 from Dungannon to Ballygawley and the  completion of the dualling of the main Belfast  to Dublin road  &mdash; the section from Beech Hill to Cloghogue, a scheme that is close to my heart.  However, it is likely that the roads allocation will necessitate the deferral  of some schemes; dare I say that two of those are the A6 dual carriageway from  Castledawson to Toome and the A2 from Maydown to the airport at Londonderry.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Spending on local transport and safety measures, bridge  strengthening, carriageway widening and major works on local roads will need to  be less than was envisaged during the three years to 2010-11. The Committee  calls on the Executive to review the roads allocation in the light of the  importance of a free-flowing road system to the continued economic development  of Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also examined in detail the issue of  investment in public transport, particularly buses and railways. We believe  that that is important to the social and economic well-being of Northern Ireland.  Like roads infrastructure, a good-quality integrated network of bus and rail  transport is key to the underpinning of economic development, as well as access  to education, employment, leisure and social services. Investment in public  transport also brings enormous environmental benefits in the form of reduced  carbon emissions and air and noise pollution.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  You wrote that bit.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  did.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, there has  been persistent underinvestment in public transport infrastructure. The  Committee discovered that, in addition to the &pound;426 million capital bid, only  &pound;196 million has been allocated in the draft Budget, including &pound;137 million for  rail, &pound;47 million for buses, and &pound;1&middot;2 million for improved ferry services to  Rathlin Island, which will certainly keep at least one Member happy.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee calls on the Executive to deal with the  failures of the past and to invest in public transport. Failure to adequately  resource public transport will have an adverse effect on the environment and  exacerbate social exclusion, and might jeopardise the recent and much-welcomed  positive economic growth.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has met both Into the West and the Northern  Corridor Railways Group and has heard evidence of public safety issues and  speed restrictions, which are as low as 10 mph on stretches of track between Belfast and Londonderry.  It is absolutely appalling that, after a huge amount of money has been spent on  new trains for that line, their speed must be reduced to 10, 15 or 20 mph on  various parts of the track. That is totally unacceptable.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Having championed the cause of women&rsquo;s access to  concessionary fares, the Committee welcomes the proposal in the draft Budget  for the extension of those fares. It is extremely good news for all concerned.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Age Concern and Help the Aged provided evidence to the  Committee on the differential patterns of urban and rural use of the senior  Smartpass and the bias against disabled people that is posed by the limitation  of the concession to single-journey tickets.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, time is running out fast. Therefore, I will  turn quickly to the issue of environmental sustainability. The draft Programme  for Government includes a priority to protect and enhance Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  environment and natural resources. However, there is little evidence of the  radical thinking and policies that are  needed to deliver a 60% to 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050,  which was identified by the Prime Minister in a speech as recently as 19 November. The DRD allocations do not appear to  reflect the need to deal with the issue with any immediacy.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The investment  strategy&rsquo;s major proposals make  substantial reference to the environmental impact of differing forms of  infrastructure investment, but it is not clear to the Committee that that has  been followed through in the draft Budget and the ISNI 2 allocation stage.  Indeed, a quick glance at the draft Programme  for Government indicates that it has not taken full cognisance of the  hugely demanding targets for carbon  reductions that are faced during the next 50 years.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Mr Speaker, can I say at the outset that I am genuinely grateful to all  Members? I believe that, in my efforts to get up and say a few words, I have  actually lost pounds.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will start off in a mode of generosity. I listened  genuinely and with good intent yesterday to the First Minister&rsquo;s speech on the  draft Programme for Govern&shy;ment and the draft investment strategy. I assure the  House that we all want to do what is best  for the people of Northern    Ireland, and we got involved in the process  to see if we could work something out. We have some concerns, especially about the lack of a financial package. In  fact, Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s Chief Whip, Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, mentioned at the start of the  debate that everybody agrees that there is  not enough money in the draft Budget to go around, and I did not hear  anybody demurring. Peter Robinson, Peter Weir and Nigel Dodds &mdash; every&shy;body &mdash;  have said that we need a financial package. The truth is that we did not get  enough.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to deal with the comments that have been made  about whether or not the Ulster Unionist Party is in Government. We will not  agree with every decision that is made by the Executive just because we have  two Ministers in it. We reserve the right, as Members of the Assembly, to  scrutinise the draft Budget and everything else that is going on.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the position of the Ulster Unionist Party in the  Executive was dictated by the votes of the people? We are not there at the behest of other political parties &mdash;  particularly the DUP and least of all, Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Member for his inter&shy;vention. We are represented on the Executive  as of right. With regard to whether it is right to oppose or to criticise a  Budget, I quote from Ian Paisley Jnr:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I found the Committee Chairpersons&rsquo; comments in the  report of the draft Budget very interesting &mdash; so much for a united approach.  The Chairpersons of various Committees &mdash; and not just DUP Chairpersons, but Ulster Unionist, SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in  Chairpersons &mdash; all criticised the Budget proposals.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Bound Volume 8, p131, col 2]</span></span>.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Also, Sammy Wilson &mdash; I was rather hoping that Sammy would  be here, but unfortunately he has left &mdash; declared:</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;I want to make the position clear from the start: the DUP is  opposed to the Budget.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Official Report, Bound Volume 7,  p185, col 1]</span>.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is entirely legitimate for the Ulster Unionist  Party to say that there are better ways to do things. We agree that there are  limited budgets, and we will have to find a way of dealing with those.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">When we were talking about the draft Programme for  Government yesterday, I promised to talk about the Barnett formula. I do not  propose to bore Members at this stage, except to say, following on from Mr  Wells &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I could not do that to you. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am depending on the indulgence of the Speaker to get  through this speech.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is per capita expenditure. Mr Wells talked about  roads. Why do we have a higher per capita expenditure on roads? Because we have  a large rural area, and we need more roads  to go around. Furthermore, we need to have a headquarters. Northern Ireland is a small country compared to England or Scotland, for instance, and  therefore we have higher overheads. The Barnett formula recognises that some  areas in any union are less economically viable than others, but that does not  mean that they are any less valuable. That is why  the Barnett formula is important to us, and it applies as much to health  issues as it does to anything else.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to the Chairperson of the Committee for  Education, Sammy Wilson, talking about the education budget &mdash; I presume that he  was reading from the same file that I have. Education had a baseline of &pound;1,720  million last year, and this year it has a baseline of &pound;1,626 million, so we  have lost about &pound;100 million before we start. Furthermore, in the rest of the United Kingdom,  education budgets received an increase of 5&middot;3%. I realise that the increases  are unhypothecated, but we only got a 4&middot;3% increase.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">That unhelpful differential  means that the Committee&rsquo;s analysis to date demonstrates that the  Department will face particular difficulties in obtaining funding to maintain  projects for children and young people and for the development of integrated  education. I agree with Maurice Morrow that those issues and others, such as  early-years education, must be tackled.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Committee has stated that the Depart&shy;ment will  not have any money in years 1 and 2 and will not, therefore, be able to tackle  disadvantaged areas or to commit funds to community renewal. That is a problem:  the money must be found for those people. The Committee notes its concerns that  insufficient Budget resources could delay indefinitely any attempt to tackle  the issues of special education needs or to develop the early-years strategy.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly has said that it will tackle early-years  education: it is the right thing to do, but there is no budget. Efforts to  improve levels of literacy and numeracy may have to be scaled back  significantly. The Committee notes that not receiving the funding for the bid  runs counter to PSAs 10 and 19 in the draft Programme for Government and is at  odds with the commitments given after the report by the Public Accounts  Committee at Westminster.  The Assembly simply must deal with literacy and numeracy issues.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps the Department for Employment and Learning&rsquo;s budget  could be used to tackle the issue. However, the Department of Education&rsquo;s bid  for the improvement in literacy and numeracy was for &pound;23 million next year, &pound;32  million the following year and &pound;32 million for 2011, but it received nothing.  How can problems with literacy and numeracy be tackled if budgets are being cut  and no new money is being brought in?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">What is being done about adult apprenticeships or making ICT  the third essential skill? The draft Budget states that DEL has apparently been granted an extra bid  of &pound;36&middot;8 million. However, when inescapable costs are removed, that leaves only &pound;7 million. Alex Attwood pointed  out that the departmental budget increases from &pound;731&middot;5 million in 2007-08 to  &pound;734&middot;4 million in 2008-09, a rise of only &pound;2&middot;9 million. How can the Assembly  tackle all the problems on which it made promises?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As Members have mentioned, resources must be targeted to  areas of most need, such as north Belfast.  I was quite taken by the fact there have been efficiency savings of &pound;66 million  in north and west Belfast  over the past three years, and that some 400 teachers have been made redundant.  If those redundancies had been in line with the decline in pupil numbers, only  140 teachers would have gone. Therefore, north and west Belfast are losing teachers.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">How much money does it take to tackle that? Members have  been asked to come up with constructive ideas, and I have done so: &pound;3 million  would pay for between two and five additional teaching assistants per school to  concentrate on literacy and numeracy and to help children and their parents in  north and west Belfast.  An extra 100 teaching assistants could be divided  between 40 schools in areas that Members know have the greatest social  need. Furthermore, that money would pay for six specialist teachers to give  instruction on best practice.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">London Challenge&rsquo;s report will show that it was able to  make huge differences in the levels of literacy and numeracy with a budget of  only &pound;4 million. I ask all Departments to work with the Department of Education  to amass that money. I agree that cross-cutting issues such as health,  parenting skills, early learning and antisocial behaviour must be tackled. The  Assembly would have community support in addressing those issues.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I promised the Speaker that I would try to be brief. To  conclude, therefore, the Ulster Unionist Party is willing to work with Members  in a reasonable, frank and positive manner, but we must work together: the  Assembly is not a diktat.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I am slightly confused. Yesterday, and for part of today, some Members wanted  to turn the Assembly into the Supreme Soviet in order to rubber-stamp a draft Budget.  The Chamber is intended for parliamentary debate, and it is the duty of all  Members to scrutinise and criticise where necessary.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP will do that,  as will our colleagues in other parties.  To characterise us as being against the Executive or the spirit of the  Executive is completely and utterly wrong. It is our duty to criticise. Members  who are outside the Executive, specifically from the Alliance Party, should not  be criticised for criticising the draft Budget; they have acted honourably in doing  so.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Does the Member agree that if the Government are confident about their  programme, they should welcome the scrutiny of those in opposition?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Yes. In fact, yesterday, the First Minister invited criticism, unlike some DUP  and Sinn F&eacute;in Back Benchers. The Sinn F&eacute;in Whip, Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, said that  there is not enough money for everyone and  that we should not use emotional blackmail. I represent North Belfast  and I have no hesitation in criticising the draft Budget for falling short of  the social-housing target for the next five years &mdash; 2,000 houses. That target  will not be reached under the allocation that the Minister of Finance and  Personnel has made in the draft Budget.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Finance and Personnel told the Minister for  Social Development to sell land and finance housing through private means. Only  minutes ago, William McCrea was criticising the Minister of Agriculture for selling land &mdash; he pointed out the  dangers of doing that. There are dangers in selling assets to provide  capital for housing development in Northern Ireland, which all Members agree is absolutely necessary.  &lsquo;Building a Better Future &mdash; Draft Investment Strategy 2008-2018&rsquo; states that  that is one of the Executive&rsquo;s top priorities. How can houses be built without  money? Does land have to be sold? How much will a Department raise if it sells  all its land? How long will that take? If that is a solution &mdash; which I doubt &mdash;  it is a long-term one.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Is Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n telling the 2,300 people on the  social-housing waiting list in North Belfast not to worry because land will be  sold so that in five or 10 years&rsquo; time homelessness in North   Belfast will be solved? That is ridiculous, yet it is what Fra  McCann suggested to the House. He said that the Minister for Social Development  blames everyone but herself, and he criticised her severely on all areas of her  brief. Yet what does Fra McCann do? He backs the Budget that prevents the  Minister for Social Development from achieving the housing allocations that  will meet the needs of the homeless in Northern Ireland. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> He supports &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  He supports the Budget that will stop fuel poverty being alleviated in Northern Ireland.  That is the right-wing agenda that the Minister of Finance and Personnel is  putting before Sinn F&eacute;in Members and other Members. Members have a duty to  reject that right-wing Thatcherite agenda. If Sinn F&eacute;in Members do not  recognise that the draft Budget pushes a Thatcherite approach to social  development, they must be politically blind and illiterate.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">A Sinn F&eacute;in Member said  that the Minister for Social Development should ask the housing  associations for their assets. How can she do that? How can she tell a private  body that she needs its money for the Govern&shy;ment&rsquo;s housing policy?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It would be impossible for the Minister to do that. The  Minister for Social Development and her Depart&shy;ment have a duty to make  efficiencies; the draft Budget states that that Department will make efficiency  savings of &pound;113 million over the next four years, which is an important  contribution. All Departments have a duty to look at efficiencies, and to use them  to make funds available for other Departments.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  No, I will not, because I have only a few minutes left.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Finance has suggested that there are  additional sources of private finance &mdash; I would love to know where they are,  and whether they are readily available.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">DSD requested &pound;992 million in its capital bids for housing  and urban regeneration, and &pound;373 million over the first three years of the  investment strategy. The draft Budget allocations are short by &pound;775 million and  &pound;139 million respectively, in terms of  urban regeneration. These allocations are completely inadequate, and the  Minister has said so to the Committee. The House should note that she had  all-party support at the Committee in her quest to gain sufficient allocations  for housing, urban regeneration and fuel poverty. No one dissented, so I am  surprised that some members of that Committee who are here today are now  retrospectively attacking the Minister.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The allocations are completely inadequate. They cannot  provide 10,000 new homes over the next five years; that will be unrealistic if  the allocations made by the Minister of Finance and Personnel remain. I hope  that he listens to the comments made in the House today and amends those  allocations, so that we can provide people in Northern Ireland with decent homes  and eliminate fuel poverty at last. That is the duty of the Executive.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I note that the First Minister is here. One of my first  memories of the First Minister is from the Bannside by-election, which he won. On that occasion he dedicated himself  to improving the living standards of ordinary people  and to eliminating poverty and the worst housing conditions that he had  ever witnessed. I hope that he remembers that, because there is a duty  incumbent upon him, and the Executive, to fulfil those promises.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: I wish that I had some of Mr  Maginness&rsquo;s tablets, to allow me to reach the ceiling in the way that he has. I  will deal with the points that he raised, as well as the comments made by the  Member for Lagan Valley Mr Basil McCrea, who, when he talked about economics  and statistics, made a very good case for more money being spent on numeracy. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on the four-party mandatory-coalition  Executive&rsquo;s draft Budget proposals. I do that following yesterday&rsquo;s  debate on the draft Programme for Government and draft investment strategy for Northern Ireland.  It is essential, as part of the wider consultation, to hear the issues that  concern Members.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly and its  Committees have an important role &mdash; now and over the next three years &mdash;  to ensure that the funds allocated in the Budget are translated into the  maximum possible improvements in local public services. In that context, I  record my gratitude to the Committee for Finance and Personnel for the efforts  it has made, and will continue to make, in drawing the issues together in this  important process.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have listened carefully to Members&rsquo; comments on the draft  Budget flowing from yesterday&rsquo;s debate, and I will attempt to respond to as  many of the themes as possible. However, before I do that, I will highlight in  broad terms what the four-party mandatory-coalition Executive are seeking to  achieve with their public expenditure proposals. I will focus on three main  issues: first, our key priority of growing the economy; secondly, core public  services; and thirdly, the local contribution to funding public services through  the regional rate.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will be  aware, the four-party mandatory-coalition Executive have agreed that the  key priority should be to secure growth in the economy. That is not only  because it is one of the aspects of our society where we are furthest behind  the rest of the UK,  but also because of its importance in so much of our everyday lives. It is not  simply a matter of the amount of money at our disposal, but also of the wider  benefits of having a job &mdash; not only for one&rsquo;s self-worth, but also for our  families and the wider society.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Although progress has been made in some aspects of the  economy &mdash; there has been an increase of more than 100,000 jobs since 1998 &mdash;  significant underlying deficiencies remain in the economy that will need to be  addressed if we are to sustain that growth in future.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to competitiveness indicators such as business  start-up rates and investment in innovation and workforce skills, Northern Ireland performs well below the UK average, and local productivity is about one  fifth lower than the UK  average. The highly regrettable recent job losses, including those at Seagate  Technology in Limavady, Regency Spinning Ltd in Newtownards and Reid Transport  at Cloughmills, have highlighted that we cannot compete solely on cost in the  longer term. That point is highlighted in the draft regional economic strategy,  which reached the stark conclusion that there will be little or no improvement  in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  position relative to the rest of the UK if there is not a radical  rethink of the approach to economic development and support to local business.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The clear focus on the economy in the draft Budget, with  its increased allocations for DETI,   DEL and DRD, reflects an initial  step by the Executive in addressing the issue. That move has received a broad  welcome from key stakeholders. However, as with all public spending, it is not  sufficient simply to increase funding. It is essential that the programmes of  support for economic development are continually reviewed and updated to ensure  that there is delivery on the key goals of halving the private-sector  productivity gap with the UK average &mdash; excluding the greater south-east &mdash; by  2015, and of increasing the employment rate from 70% to 75% by 2020.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In taking forward plans to provide new and enhanced  services for the people of Northern Ireland &mdash; for example, the extension of  free public transport to everyone of 65 years of age and over &mdash; it is also  important to strike a balance to ensure that core public services have  sufficient funding, and also to provide the  incentive to deliver existing services more effectively.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Although all Ministers made the case to me about the need  for additional resources for their respective Departments, the main issues  since the publication of the draft Budget have been the proposed resource allocation for the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety and the capital allocation for the Department  for Social Development. Some people have suggested that the position in some  way under&shy;mines the Health Service, while the allocation for housing will lead  to a crisis &mdash; indeed, according to the previous Member, the crisis of  homelessness has already happened.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The four-party  mandatory-coalition Executive would have liked to allocate more  public-services funding. However, financial realities mean that that was not possible. In addition, concerns about impacts on  services have been exaggerated to an extent that the facts show is not  credible.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget sets out plans for health and social care  to receive an additional &pound;450 million by 2010-11. That is equivalent to 51% of  the total additional resources that will be available to the Northern Ireland  Departments. There will be a further &pound;340 million increase in spending power  from efficiencies that the Minister has agreed to make.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Amid the doom and gloom that some have declared, it is  important to recognise that the draft Budget allocation for DHSSPS will allow a  number of service developments to be progressed over the three-year period,  including improved services for children and meeting the revenue costs for  capital investment in new and improved facilities. Additionally, the further  funding for pay reform that has already been made should result in improved  public services. Those are some examples of what can be achieved from the &pound;700  million of inescapable pressures, as defined by the Health Minister. It is up  to him to decide which additional discretionary service developments are to be  progressed over the Budget period.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that Members wish that more money was made  available. However, it is important that the context of the Health Department&rsquo;s  proposed allocation be understood. In particular, I reiterate the points that I  have made in recent weeks: expenditure on health and social care in Northern  Ireland is 10% higher than in England; over the next three years, the draft  Budget proposes that the Health Department will receive more than half of the  additional resources that are available to all Departments; and, by 2010-11,  health will account for almost 48% of the total spend.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Minister will have more &mdash; and a larger  proportion of &mdash; money at his disposal than any of his predecessors. To achieve  higher levels of health spending growth would require substantial reductions to  other Department&rsquo;s allocations, or a massive hike in rates. That cannot be  justified.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Funding levels are only part of the solution. There is no  point in pumping money into an inefficient system. It is noticeable that most  of the people who opposed the level of the Health budget were silent when it  was half of what is being proposed now.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Nothing that I have said  suggests that some additional resources for the health and social care  sector would not bring further benefits to the people of Northern Ireland.  I fully recognise and support that, and I am open to suggestions as to where  such funds would yield the most benefit. However, I am also open to suggestions  about where those resources might be found. Mr Speaker, you are a patient man  and, thus far, you have sat through the whole four-hour debate. When you are  driving home to Londonderry, away from the  Members who made bids for more money during the debate this afternoon and  evening, I challenge you to think of even one who put forward a single  suggestion as to how additional resources might be found to fund those bids.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The most obvious example of need in the Health Service is  in the mental-health sector &mdash; and Members have referred to the Bamford Review.  In Northern Ireland, that  need is almost 50% higher than in England, and that is one of the  main reasons why the overall local need for health and social-care services is  higher. However, mental-health service funding is higher per capita than for England, which  suggests that, in the past, either sufficient funds were not allocated or funds  were diverted to other sectors, such as acute services.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Minister identified mental-health services as a  priority for his Department &mdash; albeit that that was his seventeenth priority. In  that context, the draft Budget identifies just less than &pound;50 million to  implement the Bamford Review proposals by 2011.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  I thank my Rt Hon friend for giving way. That issue is so high a priority for  the Minister for Health that when the Assembly debated the Bamford Review on 18  December 2006, autism issues on 9 January 2007, and the future of Muckamore Abbey Hospital  on 29 January 2007, he made no contribution whatsoever.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: I shall divert slightly from my speech to deal with that point,  because there is an issue of which the Assembly must be mindful. The four main parties in the Assembly have Ministers in the  Executive who are responsible for Departments. Mr Speaker, you decided,  quite rightly, that the amendment tabled by the Ulster Unionist Party and the  SDLP could not be moved today, but I noted that the only Departments about  which those parties were concerned were the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety, and the Department for Social Development.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>: On a point of order, Mr Speaker. You asked us very kindly to withdraw the amendments, which we did to  facilitate the House. Is it in order for the Minister  to refer to an amendment that we cannot defend?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That is not a point of order. That is part of the heat of debate in the  Chamber.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Mr Speaker, the Member is right about one point &mdash; he cannot defend it; it is  indefensible. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Some parties have decided, somewhat like football  supporters, to cheer for the Departments of their respective Ministers. I can  understand parties wanting to support their Ministers vocally or in any other  way that they can. However, some of us have  responsibilities that go beyond departmental vested interests. We must  look at the overall position of Northern    Ireland. We must balance the issues of all  Departments &mdash; not fight for only one or two.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Members must be careful when they are putting forward a  case for one Department, for which their Minister happens to be responsible,  that they do not forget the real need that exists in other areas.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I return to the issue of mental health. The allocation of  &pound;4&middot;5 billion for the health budget, with an additional &pound;8 million being made  available, means that the figure that I have indicated was discussed by the  Department of Health and my officials, as  being required to implement the  Bamford Review recommendations, would represent only 6% of the additional allocation, or just over 1% of the  total allocation to the Health Department.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that Members  will agree that, if the Minister wants to deal with that serious issue,  he can ring-fence funding for some of the most vulnerable people in society,  given that the required funding amounts to such a small proportion of the  additional resources that are at his disposal.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have been asked, outside the House, whether I could  ensure that funds are allocated specifically for mental-health services, given the history of such service  provision in Northern    Ireland. Having considered that matter, I  would be very reluctant to even think about micromanaging any Minister&rsquo;s  Department. I am sure that, when the  Minister gets down to the serious business of setting out his actual  spending plans when the allocation is agreed, he will deal with that issue.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, it must be  said that the four-party mandatory-coalition Executive could allocate  funds to the Health Service, with a ring-fenced portion for mental-health  services, if it chose to do so.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Returning to the overall funding for health, a key point is that the figures quoted for additional  requirements are simply unrealistic. The focus must be on using existing  resources better, rather than asking for more funding. As I have said before,  we need a better Health Service, not a more expensive one.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The concerns that have been raised about resource  expenditure for health have been repeated about the capital expenditure for  social housing. Social housing is an important priority for everyone in Northern Ireland,  and it should be available for those who need it most. The Department for  Social Development will have almost &pound;720 million to invest in housing over the  next three years. The investment strategy proposes further investment of over  &pound;1&middot;2 billion over the following seven years, which brings the total funding to almost  &pound;2 billion over the next decade.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Members have been fond of quoting comparisons with England; let me  join in. The number of social houses per head of population in Northern Ireland is already 30% higher than in England, and levels of housing unfitness here  are the lowest in the United    Kingdom. In addition, the number of social  housing completions over the past five years was 60% higher here than in England.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, although I fully support the Social Development  Minister&rsquo;s call for more investment in social housing &mdash; as reflected in the  additional &pound;20&middot;4 million that I announced  recently &mdash; the Department for Social Development will also need to  actively consider how the proposed allocations from the draft Budget can be  supplemented by additional income. That could come,  for example, from private-developer contributions. I know that the Minister of the Environment has  already had talks with the Minister for Social Development regarding  issues that relate to planning. Indeed, the Minister for Social Development  should also be considering issues such as land sales.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I noted in a press statement issued yesterday by Mr Alban  Maginness that he indicated that the allocation for housing was so bad that  there was real doubt as to whether the Department for Social Development can  build even one social house. Members discredit any cause that they have when  they go off the scale in that way. Given  the millions of pounds that will be available for housing in the Department for Social Development&rsquo;s budget, to make that kind of claim is petty and  ridiculous.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As I have indicated to  the Minister for Social Develop&shy;ment regarding the scope for additional  funding, additional resources are available  for capital investment in 2010-11 from the draft Budget. Those resources  will be supplemented by the ongoing work of the capital realisation task force.  However, it is important to recognise that there will be a number of competing  priorities for the additional resources that become available. The four-party mandatory coalition Executive will need  to decide what should be delivered in social housing as opposed to other  capital projects.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Incidentally, there is one contribution that Members can make &mdash; I have asked my colleagues on the  Business Committee to press for a debate on the issue of rationalising  our political bureaucracy, reducing the number of Departments in Northern Ireland, and reconsidering the number  of Assembly Members for this small region of the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I am not sure that all Members are saying &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; at this stage. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Minister has the Floor. Practically  every Member in the House has got to speak today. Allow the Minister to  respond.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  That will be a way of freeing up resources for use in front line public  services. I hope that when the Business  Committee considers the matter, there will be enthusiasm on the part of  its members to bring that motion to the Assembly. Furthermore, I hope that when  it does come before the Assembly, it will receive support across the Chamber.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will now talk about the regional rate and the local  contribution to public services. Despite the promise of a new four-party  mandatory-coalition Executive, this remains  a time of significant concern for many hard-pressed householders in Northern Ireland.  Oil prices continue to rise, and the Bank of England base lending rate is  5&middot;75%, which is almost 65% higher than its low point of 3&middot;5% in July 2003. In  addition, the price of household staples  such as milk and vegetables are rising at a faster rate than incomes. At  this time, a key duty of the four-party mandatory coalition Executive must be to ensure that it does not add to the already  heavy burden on households. In that context, Members will hardly need to be reminded that over the past five years,  regional domestic rates have increased by 62%, with a 19% increase in  one year alone.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Looking forward, the four-party mandatory coalition Executive has unanimously accepted the key recommend&shy;ations  of the Independent Water Review Panel&rsquo;s  strand-one report, which will lead to additional, but necessary, household contributions to those services from  2009-10.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">While we will mitigate that expense, by recognising that  the existing regional rate contains a contribution to those services estimated  at an average of &pound;160 per household, it is essential that we also recognise the  historical and future pressures on household bills. Accordingly, the draft  Budget proposes that there will be no increase in the regional domestic rate in  each of the next three years. That is equivalent to a reduction of over 8% in  real terms over that period.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Direct rule Ministers  intended to introduce water and sewerage  charges from 2007-08 without taking account of rate bills. Increases in  the regional rate under direct rule were, on average, 9.8% per annum. Our  proposals will mean that each household in Northern Ireland will save, on  average, over &pound;1,000 over the period 2007-08 to 2010-11 compared to the direct  rule proposals.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to the non-domestic sector, since 2001-02, the  increase in the non-domestic regional rate has been 3&middot;3% per annum. Recognising the need to limit the cost pressures on local businesses, the draft Budget  proposes that the increase be held at the level of inflation in each of  the Budget years. That will mean that there will be no increase in real terms  in the burden to business from the regional rate in the planning period.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In recognition of the particular pressures facing the  manufacturing sector, I propose to freeze industrial rates liability at 30%  across the Budget period, which, again,  represents a significant saving against the previous direct rule  proposals.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday, I was astounded to hear one Member say that she opposed my proposals to freeze  industrial rates at 30%. She said:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;However, all I see is subsidy to businesses and snubs  to those who work for a living in our forgotten communities.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Vol 25, No 7 Part 1, p338]</span></span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">She went on to say:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Chancellor  Robinson has made the ludicrous decision to maintain the blanket subsidy  to manufacturing companies by continuing rates relief.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 25,  No 7, Part 1, p338]</span></span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">and continued with:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;fat cats get  benefits. Corporate welfare seems to be alive and well in  &ldquo;Robinsonland&rdquo;. &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 25, No 7 Part 1, p338]</span></span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That same Member was at a breakfast this morning,  which I also attended. There, it was pointed out that 48% of the manufacturing  industry in Belfast is in her constituency &mdash; and mine &mdash; East   Belfast. I can tell her, having been around those  businesses in East Belfast that, had we not taken that step, one company alone  would have had to lay off 100 workers, and it would have been stopped from  moving ahead with a proposal that would have meant 1,400 jobs in East Belfast.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Another company that I  visited with the Department, only 10 days ago, indicated that the  decision that had been taken gave them the confidence to go ahead and make the  decisions to expand and therefore bring new jobs to that constituency.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Like the Member for  East Antrim Mr Wilson, I noted the  comments towards the end of that Member&rsquo;s speech when she decided to  harangue Sinn F&eacute;in. She said that the DUP are walking all over it &mdash;</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;on public-private partnerships, less Government and  equality issues.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 25, No 7, Part 1, p339].</span></span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I take from that, that she actually believes that  there should be more government. We were talking about the politburo a short  time ago. I can remember watching a film about an invasion of the United States by Comm&shy;unist forces drawn from Russia and Cuba. It was the well-named &lsquo;Red  Dawn&rsquo;.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the decision taken to freeze industrial  rates is a sensible one that will lead to more jobs, and importantly &mdash; as  everyone will have seen over past weeks &mdash; it will do a great deal to safeguard  the jobs we already have.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am appalled by the blinkered and twisted thinking that  assumes that a business-friendly Budget is good for business leaders and therefore it must be bad for the  workforce. It is that kind of crazy logic that has led to the draft Budget  being characterised as neo-Thatcherite and right-wing. That is nonsense.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">This is a Budget for everyone. It is a Budget for business, but also one for the working man and  woman. It is a Budget to get the economy moving &mdash; it is not right wing,  simply right. Dawn Purvis chides Sinn F&eacute;in and the Democratic Unionist Party.  She should speak to the workers in East Belfast  whose jobs have been saved, and who will  gain jobs as a result of the decision that we have taken.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">6.45 pm</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>: Will the Minister remind the House of a quotation in yesterday&rsquo;s Hansard from the Member for Lagan  Valley Basil McCrea, in which he referred to comments that &ldquo;Red Dawn&rdquo; made?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: I heard the Member for Lagan   Valley applaud and  welcome Ms Purvis&rsquo;s speech. I must say, however, that, after an intervention  from me, he did qualify his comments by  saying that he applauded some of Ms  Purvis&rsquo; remarks, although he did not specify which of her remarks he was  applauding.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>: Will the Minister allow me to specify those remarks now?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: No. The Member managed to wangle the opportunity to make a  speech in this debate, and that has left us tight for time.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The approach that I have taken to rates reflects the  four-party mandatory coalition Executive&rsquo;s desire to redress the balance from  previous direct rule Budgets, in which the local ratepayer was expected to  shoulder too great a share of the burden for the delivery of public services.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The 2004 spending review staff-reduction targets are an  indicator of the departmental performance that we can expect. The  fit-for-purpose target, which was established  in December 2004, required that the number of Civil Service-funded posts  in April 2004 be reduced by 2,300 by March 2008. In overview, progress to date is a clear indication that we are well on track  to meeting that target. Indeed, the latest information shows that we are  ahead of the planned trajectory.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Many commentators, including some present in the House,  expressed concern that the target could be achieved only through a form of  redundancy scheme; however, the Civil Service labour pool has proved to more dynamic than those commentators thought  possible. Our latest figures show that  natural turnover in the Civil Service is 5&middot;4%. On that basis, we can be  confident that Departments are, and will continue to be, able to adjust numbers  without recourse to any form of redundancy  scheme. Looking ahead, we can be confident that that dynamism will be  maintained, and possibly enhanced, as our  plans to develop and grow the economy and a vibrant private sector begin  to yield dividends.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party  expressed concern at the inability of the draft Budget to address  economic growth. The broader question is the extent to which a devolved  Executive, with limited fiscal powers and budget, can address economic growth  in a global marketplace that is worth many  trillions of pounds. The approach adopted represents full use of the  powers that we have, with a focus on putting in place the conditions for  growth, through working alongside local  business and employee representatives. Therefore, I fully believe that  the four-party mandatory coalition Executive&rsquo;s draft Budget proposals to  reverse the downward trend and funding for economic development and to minimise  the rates burden on business, together with plans to improve our economic  infrastructure, are a significant improvement on the plans of each of our  previous Administrations. I am under no illusion that even more could have been  done, but I was determined to protect our  public services, such as health and education, which also required  additional funding, so my Budget has sought to strike a balance.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I share the view of  many that savings could have been made  from various sources, including the cost of division, which it is  perhaps necessary for me to spell out. I dealt in some detail during Question  Time with some of the Alliance Party&rsquo;s unrealistic expectations about what  savings may come from that source. However, I share the view that savings could  be made from that source, albeit on a more limited scale than the Alliance  Party suggests. I have asked my officials to examine the findings of the  Deloitte report, with a view to identifying those elements in it that can be  addressed in the short term. Similarly, I encourage all Ministers to make as  many savings as possible from that area, particularly as they have made it  clear to me that the efficiency savings already expected over the next three years  will represent a significant challenge to them.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, all scope  for savings needs to be vigorously pursued. In taking forward its work,  I will also ask the performance and efficiency delivery unit to consider the  potential savings to be gained from reducing the cost of division.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There are two issues that I must address, the first of  which is the role of the Executive. In any Government, the intention is that people who intend to seek a mandate should put their proposals before the electorate  and seek an endorsement of those proposals. If it is a one-party  Government, the process is simple: they use their manifesto as their Programme  for Government, and they proceed. However, in the case of a voluntary or  mandatory coalition, there is a requirement for them to agree on a Programme  for Government. If there is no agreed  Programme for Government, there is no coalition.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">One cannot adopt a position whereby some people decide to  be in Government, but do not want to agree with  the Government&rsquo;s programme. That is an untenable position. That is not to say that Members of Government parties &mdash; in the Executive or in the Assembly &mdash;  cannot choose to make comments,  criticise &mdash; or suggest changes to &mdash; the Programme for Government, the  investment strategy or the Budget. Last night, there was not one squeak from any of the Ministers who were  prepared to allow their parties to vote against the draft Programme for Government. Not one of them suggested any  change to that programme. Therefore, we need to have some sincerity in  an Executive.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">If there are going to be changes, and if there is a feeling  that changes are needed, some Ministers have let down their Assembly colleagues  by not suggesting those changes within the Executive. I am quite content for Members to express concerns, and for the  Executive to consider those concerns  when making final decisions about the draft Programme for Government and  the draft Budget.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The second issue that I must address is the fact that some  parties in the Chamber appear to be in denial. It is clear that an attempt is  being made to suggest that there is an Executive in Northern Ireland that consists only  of two parties. That is, quite transparently, not the case. I hope that, in the  references that I have made tonight, that  it is abundantly clear that we have a four-party mandatory-coalition  Executive, of which the Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP are part. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am quite happy if Members wish to say that their party is withdrawing from the Executive. The  Executive is built on a system that was negotiated by the Ulster  Unionist Party and the SDLP. They are the parties &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Order. I call for order on all sides of the House. I have  continually said that almost all Members from all sides of the House have  contributed to the debate, as far as possible. The Minister is responding. I realise that, in the heat of debate, it is not  easy for some Members to sit and listen. Nevertheless, the Minister is  now responding. Allow the Minister to respond.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Again, I make it clear that the four parties  who are in the Executive need to have an agreed Programme for Government and need to agree a Budget. In neither  case, was an amendment suggested that would reduce the Budget in one area so  that additional funding could be provided  in another. No such proposal was put by any party in the Executive,  including the two parties that are complaining.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">No change was  recommended to the draft Programme for Government by either of the  parties who have now decided that they want to decry it. They are in denial and  attempting to pretend that they are, somehow, out of Government, but at the  same time taking the benefits of being in Government. That type of hokey-cokey  party politics simply will not wash with the people of Northern Ireland.  They know that the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist Party are a part of the  Government and are responsible, as is every party in the Government, for the  decisions that are taken. In particular, the Ulster Unionist Party was gagging  to get into Government.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It was gagging to get into Government so much that it put  out statements telling the electorate of Northern Ireland that it would be  in Government. Come what may, the Ulster  Unionist Party would be in the Executive and would take its seats. I  could spend time reciting its quotations, but the Ulster Unionist Party is on  the record as saying that it would take its seats in the Executive and be  accountable. I am quite content that the Ulster Unionist Party has signed up to  the four-party mandatory coalition Executive. However, if it decides that it  does not want to proceed on that basis, we can go back and negotiate a new and  different process from the one that currently exists.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">This is the system that  the Ulster Unionists negotiated. It was the DUP that said it was not  satisfied with that system. It was our party that insisted on a requirement in  the St Andrews Agreement legislation to examine the methodology and structures  of Government in Northern    Ireland, because we did not like the system  that the Ulster Unionist Party had negotiated. We made significant changes to  the accountability within that system, as many members of that party have  already found out.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, it has to be said that the Ulster Unionists found  out about the accountability functions so acutely that instead of coming into  this Chamber to join their colleagues in the vote, their Ministers were  skulking outside and were not prepared to  come in. They knew that if they did  they would be in breach of the ministerial code and would jeopardise  their positions in the Executive.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will deal with one further issue that has arisen in the  debate. There has been a great deal of talk about the financial package. Let me  give the full history of that package. Leaving aside the fact that the Ulster  Unionist Party and the SDLP negotiated nothing positive in financial terms when  they were in the lead position, they ended up with a reinvestment and reform  initiative that forced rates in Northern    Ireland up by 62% over five years. That is  the legacy of the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s negotiations. On the other hand, the  Democratic Unionist Party renegotiated &mdash;<span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></span><span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span><span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Members must allow the Minister to continue.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  We successfully renegotiated the reinvestment and reform initiative so that I  am now able to freeze the regional rate, which I could not have done under the  agreement that was reached by the Ulster Unionist Party. We have managed to  increase the Budget for Northern    Ireland. Let us remember that the &pound;1 billion  peace package that was mentioned was based on capital, not resource: that had always  been the case. The increase amounts to significantly more than &pound;1 billion of  capital. There is no automatic end-year flexibility (EYF) for Northern Ireland.  There is no automatic right to the asset sales. Those were delivered during the  course of the negotiations with the Chancellor. The Ulster Unionists should  know that, because their representatives were there too. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span><span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Member should speak to Sir Reg Empey, because Sir Reg  was at Number 11 Downing Street with the rest of us. If the Member is  suggesting that there is failure, then there is failure on the part of his  party.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span><span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Let us have some order in the Chamber, please.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: The denial seems to go well beyond whether the Ulster Unionists  are in Government or not, but the facts are established historically and are on  the record. I remember going to Number 11 Downing Street with Sir Reg and  others as part of the negotiations for this package. If the Member is saying  that his party stopped negotiations because it was no longer interested and  gave up on a financial package, he can go and be answerable to the people of Northern Ireland.  We managed to get the increase in EYF, and the asset sales, from which we will  receive &pound;1&middot;1 billion over this period.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I would love to give way, but as the Member can see, I am literally about  halfway through what I want and need to say.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">If we had taken the advice of the Member for Strangford Mr  McNarry regarding the financial package, we  would never have set about the business of trying to get it.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">7.00 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry&rsquo;s statement, which is still on the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s website, makes it clear that he  criticised and attacked the Democratic Unionist Party for getting  involved &mdash; and he is still wrong.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  He believed that by asking for a financial  package we were handing a veto over to others.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for East Antrim Mr Beggs referred to fuel  poverty, as did the Member for Foyle. Since 2001, fuel poverty has been reduced  in 50,000 Northern Ireland  homes. Over the past five years, the warm homes scheme provided  energy-efficiency measures to over 11,000 households, with approximately 4,000 households receiving new or upgraded heating  systems.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">That is an important initiative, and the allocation of  funding will need to be balanced with the range of initiatives in the wider  housing budget, including new build, co-ownership, decent homes and  private-sector grants. I agree that it is important that the Minister for  Social Development should consult with stakeholders in taking those decisions.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for North  Antrim Mr O&rsquo;Loan mentioned social  housing. The fact that there is a draft Programme for Government with  targets is a matter of security to the Minister for Social Development. As the  targets are there, the responsibility lies with the Executive collectively to  ensure that she has the resources to meet those targets. Do not decry the  targets: it is right that they are there, and it is the responsibility of the  Executive to ensure that they are met.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for East Antrim Mr Beggs seemed to think that the budget for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister was open to criticism. It is  interesting that he criticised an increase of &pound;15&middot;1 million over the three  years in OFMDFM&rsquo;s budget, yet he did not criticise an increase of &pound;688&middot;8  million in the health budget. Considering that some of the increase in OFMDFM&rsquo;s  budget will go to victims and their dependants, I would have thought that he  may not have wanted to raise that issue.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Health, Social Service and Public Safety,  Mr McGimpsey, made an intervention during the debate. There was one notable  factor in that. Although he indicated that he needed more money, not once did  he suggest where it would come from. However, we have a clue where he thinks it  would come from. I am saddened that, behind the scenes, Minister McGimpsey&rsquo;s  Department has been arguing that additional water charging and higher rates bills  could have been used to fund Health Service bids. I resisted such a course. The  logic of the Department of Health argument would require ratepayers to pay more  than three times what they are paying today. That is totally unacceptable.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will give the same advice to the Minister of Health that  his Department received from the expert who examined thoroughly the workings of  the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety in Northern Ireland &mdash; Professor John Appleby. The  Department of Health had some communication with Professor Appleby to try to  convince him of a particular issue, and that has been brought to my attention.  In Professor Appleby&rsquo;s reply, he states:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;My impression is that a lot of work has gone into  disputing the findings of the original report, in particular as I note to boost  the need for more funding and to underplay the need for tackling poor  productivity. Maybe this was only to be expected, but is disappointing  nonetheless.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He goes on to say:</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;It is surely hard to believe that the Northern Ireland  health and social care system has or is operating at the very edge of its  production possibility frontier.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Subsequently, he states:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Surely the appropriate response now is to focus  exclusively on how Northern    Ireland can start to demonstrably and  radically improve its productivity both in cost and quality terms. During the  time that I spent on the original review, I was told by a number of people that  the problem with waiting times was either intractable or only solvable with  large amounts of extra funding. Neither has turned out to be true, and what  appeared to be inevitable long-term trends have been dramatically reversed.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The lesson to be learned from Professor Appleby is to  properly use the funds that are already available, rather than crying out for  more funds.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McLaughlin)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Members and the Minister for their  contributions to what has proved to be a  healthy and generally constructive debate on the departmental  allocations, and other issues, contained in the Executive&rsquo;s draft Budget.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In particular, I wish to thank Mervyn Storey, the Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel, for the expert manner  in which he set out the issues that have thus far been considered by the  Committee. Of course, the Committee will continue that work in the weeks ahead.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, it is difficult to do full justice to the many  contributions that were made in today&rsquo;s wide-ranging debate. With the  Assembly&rsquo;s indulgence, I will start by commenting on the various policy  headings, and I will reflect some of Members&rsquo; comments on those matters. If I  do not recognise some individual contributions, I hope that there will be no  misunder&shy;standing &mdash; there is certainly no intention on my part to ignore those  comments.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In her comments, Martina Anderson set out the stark realities of a pattern of social and economic  disadvantage. That is another legacy issue, so to speak, and one of the  many that we must all continue to address. Mr Roy Beggs questioned the  achievement of the economic package from the Chancellor. The Minister has  pointed out that the four parties to the Executive &mdash; I will not attempt to repeat  the tongue-twister that the Minister seems to have very expertly got his tongue  around &mdash; were part of the negotiations. If we did not succeed in achieving all  our objectives, it is clear that that consensus approach resulted in some  achievements. In his typically sober and understated fashion, Sammy Wilson  pointed out some examples of that consensus. In particular, he mentioned the  punitive levy that was attached to the RRI, and, of course, the increased  access to end-year flexibility.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Declan O&rsquo;Loan called  for flexibility when considering revisions to the draft Budget,  particularly given that several issues, including further efficiencies and  asset sales, are ongoing. That is fair enough &mdash; the purpose of the negotiation  and the period of consultation is to allow an opportunity for evidence-based  arguments to be advanced. Mr O&rsquo;Loan also called for a critical examination of  the efficiency targets and the role of the performance and efficiency delivery  unit. He will be aware that the Committee is just about to receive a detailed  briefing on that unit, including its remit and terms of reference.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Stephen Farry welcomed the economic focus of the Budget,  as did many other Members. However, he raised underlying concerns, including  the high cost of economic inactivity and  the large productivity gap with Britain. That is yet another legacy, but this time a  legacy of failure of the Westminster  policy that direct rule Ministers administered for many years. I believe that  the Executive have begun the task of correcting that long period of failure.  Furthermore, Dr Farry called for the  Treasury&rsquo;s one-size-fits-all approach to be challenged effectively, and  he questioned whether the existing resources and economic tools, including the  four economic drivers, are being used to maximum effect.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Predictably, I suppose, he addressed the cost to the  economy of division. Again, the Minister acknowledged that there are some  issues that could be considered. Everyone must be sensible and recognise that,  although we have made significant progress, particularly in moving out of  conflict, the work to heal divisions will  take time as those divisions have emerged over many generations.  Confidence-building in our community will also take time, especially as regards  guarantees. Debates such as this could be informed by an awareness that there is an audience. We must inform people that we have re-established the primacy of  politics.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">To turn again to the financial and economic issues, Simon Hamilton  highlighted the positive responses to the  draft Budget from the Federation of Small Businesses, the Chamber of  Commerce, the Institute   of Directors, and other  key stakeholders.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It also pointed to the continued cap on industrial rates  and the freeze on regional domestic rates as positive  outcomes for the economy. Again, the Minister has responded to that  directly. The Committee for Finance and Personnel have acknowledged and welcomed those measures unanimously. Mr  Hamilton&rsquo;s point was supported by Mr McQuillan, who also welcomed the  economic emphasis of October&rsquo;s draft Budget statement.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade  and Investment, Mr Durkan addressed the finance issue and highlighted the need to include visible funding and  focus on the social economy and on innovation. His Committee looks forward to  engagement with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment on tourism  development. Mr Durkan also informed the Assembly that his Committee would have  preferred Safe Start&rsquo;s allocation to be brought forward within the first year  of the Budget period. Those are helpful and constructive suggestions.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea, among many contributors, discussed the lack  of a sufficient financial package and raised the issue of the Barnett formula  and the needs that remain unaddressed by the draft Budget allocations. All  parties would acknowledge that the Assembly is, inevitably, in the era of  deficit Budget projections because there is simply not enough money. The  financial cake must be divided in such a way that as many as possible of the  parties&rsquo; priorities can be dealt with. The judgement is not &mdash; as is the  argument from some parties &mdash; as to whether  there are sufficient resources, but whether there has been equitable and fair distribution of available  resources. The defenders of the draft Budget, of which I am one, would argue  that a good beginning has been made.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Ms Anderson highlighted fuel poverty and social housing,  as, indeed, did several others Members. She called  on the Minister for Social Development to prioritise those issues in the  context of tackling disadvantage and achieving equality. Mr Beggs also picked  up on the issue of housing and fuel poverty,  as did Mr O&rsquo;Loan, who also focused on energy efficiency. Although Ms N&iacute;  Chuil&iacute;n supported those arguments, she also called upon the Department for  Social Development to examine its unused asset base with a view to freeing up  resources.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCann reiterated the call to progress the social  housing programme and called on the Minister for Social Development to  reprioritise in that regard, while not conceding on the case for additional  funding. Mr Brady mentioned the issue of warm homes and drew attention to a  ministerial statement on the matter. He also discussed fuel poverty and echoed  the call for reprioritisation of departmental spending plans. In a passionate  address, Alban Maginness warned that the budget for social housing would not be  met under the existing allocation.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Simon Hamilton pointed out the comparison between health  costs here and elsewhere and high&shy;lighted the Appleby Report&rsquo;s conclusions, to  which the Minister responded that health provision is about improved  performance rather than increased spend. Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n highlighted investment  in health as a strategic measure that would boost economic develop&shy;ment. In  particular, she, and several other Members, highlighted the need to deal with  the priorities that are identified in the Bamford Review of Mental Health and  Learning Disability.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister, Mr McGimpsey, set out his case for additional  funding for health. He referred to increasing pressures while also reconfirming  his commitment to tackle efficiencies. He also argued that the Health Service  is underfunded compared to that in other regions and highlighted the greater  need that exists here. The Assembly can anticipate that that debate will  continue until the settlement of the Budget allocations.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Health Committee, Mrs Robinson,  called for money to be found to meet the needs of the Rape Crisis Centre.  Although she supported the case for social housing, she cautioned against any  funding transfer away from health in that regard and warned against any further  delay in the implementation of the reform of health and personal social  services.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">She emphasised &mdash; as she has previously in the House &mdash; that  mental health is a priority for her Committee, echoing the comments of Car&aacute;l N&iacute;  Chuil&iacute;n. Brian Wilson expressed his dissatisfaction at the allocations for the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and his concerns at the  reliance on efficiency savings.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">7.15 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Environ&shy;ment,  Patsy McGlone, called for additional provision to benefit a range of projects,  and he is concerned that the efficiency drive will impact on some  lower-priority services. I guess that that is a common cause of concern across the board. In response to an  intervention from Declan O&rsquo;Loan, Mr McGlone also called for financial  resources to enable the establishment of an environmental protection agency.  Brian Wilson also addressed that matter, and he said that the targets for  reducing carbon emissions were inadequate, and that there was insufficient  allocation to promote sustainable development.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Roy Beggs mentioned funding for children, which is  cross-cutting issue. He also mentioned the recent report on the work of the  Commissioner for Children and Young People, and said that the outcome of that  report should be reflected in the draft Budget. Maurice Morrow placed focus on investing in provision for  childcare in the early education of young children and emphasised the priority  objective of improving the quality of life for our senior citizens.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and  Learning, Sue Ramsey, informed the Assembly that the Committee considers that  the overall allocation will not be sufficient to meet the goals and targets of  the draft Programme for Government. She made a range of suggestions about the  Department&rsquo;s allocation and said that a  higher priority should be given to research and development, funding for PhDs and to the promotion of ICT as  an essential skill. She also called for a range of measures in the areas of further and higher education. Paul  Butler also underlined the need to give high priority to the education and  further-education and higher-education sectors, as did other Members. Paul  Butler also placed great emphasis on the linkage between education and economic  development.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Deputy Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure, David McNarry,  emphasised the need for further and timely information on draft Budget issues from DCAL. He also called for a  complete uplift for that Department&rsquo;s budget, and highlighted a range of  specific proposals.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Regional  Development, Jim Wells, spoke on behalf of that Committee. He supported his  Department&rsquo;s call for additional resources, and he highlighted the shortfall in  roads spending compared to other regions. On behalf of his Committee, he also  supported further investment in public transport.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural  Development, the Rev McCrea, set out his concerns arising from the report of  the red meat task force. He stated that his Committee was content with the  level of administration and resource allocation in the draft Budget for the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, but he emphasised his concerns  about the sale of the entire Crossmacreevy site.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Finance and Personnel reminded Members of  the benefits that will accrue for wider society from the focus on economic  development, and he pointed to the importance of striking a balance between  ensuring that core public services have sufficient funding, and taking steps to  maximise the performance and value for money of those services. He also robustly  challenged those who are advocating additional funding requirements to state  how they believe those issues can be funded  out of finite financial resources that are presently available to the  Executive.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">He defended the overall allocation for the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety, and called on the Department for  Social Development to consider how the social-housing allocation can be  supplemented by greater revenue, effort and other measures within the  Department. The Minister pointed to the savings that householders will make  from the freeze on the domestic regional rate, and urged them to compare that  to the position under direct rule. He also highlighted the continued cap on  industrial rating, and highlighted the favourable position now, compared to the  direct rule system.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister informed Members that the Civil Service  headcount-reduction target will be achieved without any compulsory  redundancies. The Minister, as I said earlier, defended the financial package  and pointed to the renegotiation of the reinvestment and reform initiative as  enabling the freeze on the domestic regional rate. He also highlighted gains in  respect of the end-year conditions and sale of assets. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith  agat.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The need to maximise cash-releasing efficiency savings is a  core theme throughout the draft Budget. A total of &pound;793 million is targeted for  efficiency savings by 2010-11, which is equivalent to 3% annually over the CSR  period. That target will be achieved, in part, by specific, targeted reductions  in the administration costs of Departments.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the  proposed performance and efficiency delivery unit will, with agreed and  appropriate terms of reference, examine the scope for Departments to deliver  even greater cash-releasing efficiencies. In the drive for greater efficiency,  it is crucial to redirect the resulting savings to front-line services, and I  doubt that anyone would object to that being the overriding aim.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, I sound a note of caution at this point. The  Committee is aware that the targeted savings of &pound;793 million have already been  removed from departmental baseline budgets. Therefore any slippage in achieving  the planned efficiencies could result in a  cut in spending on front-line services. Nothing better underlines the requirement for all Members &mdash; members of  Committees and Ministers &mdash; to work together to ensure that we meet the  targets that we have set ourselves, while maintaining, sustaining and  developing the delivery of front-line services.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee plans to publish final departmental  efficiency delivery plans alongside the final Budget. The departmental  Committees will, therefore, have vital roles to play in monitoring and  scrutinising the progress of their respective Departments in achieving those  planned efficiencies. That is a practical example of sharing power and  responsibility.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget includes other strategic and cross-cutting  issues, not least of which is the planned reduction in over-commitment and the  need to bear down on underspend. Again, the  Assembly Committees will have an important role in monitoring and  scrutinising departmental progress.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Finance and Personnel looks forward to  receiving formal feedback from the other Statutory Committees on the draft  Budget&rsquo;s allocations to their respective Departments. Those will be included in  the Committee&rsquo;s report on the draft Budget that will be submitted to the  Department of Finance and Personnel before Christmas and published shortly  thereafter. The report will also reflect the themes that emerge from this  debate and will consider the main strategic and cross-cutting issues.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee looks forward to examining the final Budget  and to debating it in the Chamber next January. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
