			<td><p class="H1DocumentHeading">THE ASSEMBLY</p>
				<p class="H2DocumentDate">Monday 22 May 2006</p>
				<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 2.00 pm (Madam Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
				<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
				<p class="H3SectionHeading">Assembly Business</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  In accordance with the Northern Ireland Act 2006, the Secretary of State has  directed that the Assembly should sit on Monday 22 May 2006 at 2.00 pm to  consider business as it appears on the Order Paper.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">At the end of the sitting on Monday 15 May, in response to  a point of order from Dr Paisley, I advised him that I had published a list, as  required under Standing Order 3(g), before 9.30 am, in line with convention.  For the sake of accuracy, I should have said that the list was published before  10.30 am, in accordance with Standing Orders.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">In a related point of order, Mr Peter Robinson asked me to  &ldquo;clarify the situation&rdquo; with regard to that list. I have taken advice and  counsel on the matter. The list was prepared on the basis of the information  that was available at the time, and I have been advised, and am content, that  the decision that I took in publishing the list on Monday was proper and in  order. Members will be aware that a fresh list must be prepared in advance of  any sitting of the Assembly at which Ministers are to be nominated.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Counsel has also advised me that the Clerk to the Assembly  should make further enquiries of interested persons with regard to the meaning  of the phrase &ldquo;political party&rdquo; in the Assembly&rsquo;s Standing Orders, and letters  have been duly sent to party leaders.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The matter is therefore under consideration, and I intend  to make a ruling as soon as those considerations have concluded.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: On a point of order, Madam Speaker. In relation to today&rsquo;s  business and procedure, it has been rumoured and broadcast that proposals will  be made for a First Minister and his deputy, and according to the bush  telegraph, which was engineered by a lady from Canada &mdash; so she would know some&shy;thing  about that &mdash; I am to get the most honourable post of First Minister. I want you  to tell us how we will proceed today. I believe that, according to Standing  Orders, if a person &mdash;</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Order, Dr Paisley. If you give me a moment, I am about to explain that.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: Will you call me again then?</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  If necessary.</p>
				<p class="H3SectionHeading">Election of First Minister <br>
					and of Deputy First Minister</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Before we commence, I wish to explain how I propose to conduct proceedings. I  will begin by asking for proposals. Members are reminded that, under Standing  Order 15, a proposal must include candidates for both First Minister and Deputy  First Minister. If a Member wishes to make a proposal, he or she should rise in  his or her place. If a proposal is made, I will ask for the proposal to be  seconded, as required by Standing Order 15(d). Each candidate will then be asked  whether he or she accepts the nomination. There will be no debate at this  stage.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I will then seek further proposals. If further nomi&shy;nations  are made, the process of seeking seconders and having nominations accepted will  be repeated until there are no further proposals. At that point, if there are  valid proposals, Members may, if they choose, commence debate.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I intend to conduct a single debate on all the proposals,  and no Member will be permitted to speak more than once. At the end of the  debate, or if there is no debate, I shall put the Question that the first pair  of candidates be elected as First Minister and as Deputy First Minister on the  restoration of devolved government.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Under Standing Order 15, two candidates standing jointly  will not be elected to hold the two offices without the support of a majority  of the Members voting in the election, a majority of the designated  Nationalists voting and a majority of the designated Unionists voting. Should  the proposal be carried, I will ask those Members elected to be First Minister  and Deputy First Minister to affirm the terms of the Pledge of Office.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">If the motion is carried, I will deem the other proposals  to have fallen, even though they have not been put to the Assembly for  decision. If the proposal is not carried, I shall put the Question in relation  to the next pair of candidates, and so on as necessary, until a pair of  candidates is elected or all proposals are exhausted. If that is clear, we  shall proceed.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: Further to that point of order, Madam Speaker. Can I take it that,  when proposing a candidate, there is no debate, only the proposal?</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  That is correct. There is no debate until all proposals have been made. Do we  have any proposals?</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  On a point of order, Madam Speaker. Will you give some guidance to the House?  Are we electing a First Minister and a Deputy First Minister to the interim  Hain Assembly, which will not receive any transfer of Executive power, or are  we electing a First Minister and a Deputy First Minister to the Assembly that  was elected in 2003?</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  We are electing persons to hold office on the first day of restoration. I hope  that that is clear to you.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Do we have any proposals?</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Ar dt&uacute;s, sula rachaidh m&eacute; ar aghaidh, ba  mhaith liom comhbhr&oacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh le John O&rsquo;Dowd, &aacute;r gceannaire anseo, n&oacute; fuair  a mh&aacute;thair b&aacute;s ag an deireadh seachtaine. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>:  Molaim go gceaptar Ian Paisley ina Ch&eacute;ad-Aire agus go gceaptar Martin  McGuinness ina LeasCh&eacute;ad-Aire ar athbhun&uacute; an rialtais seo.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">First, may I extend condolences to John O&rsquo;Dowd, whose  mother, Bridie, died on Friday evening? John is Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s leader in this  Assembly.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I move that Ian Paisley be returned as First Minister and  Martin McGuinness be returned as Deputy First Minister on the restoration of  the devolved Administration. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Is there a Member to second the motion?</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Cuid&iacute;m leis an r&uacute;n. I second the motion.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Dr Paisley, do you accept the nomination as First Minister on the restoration  of devolved government? Order. If there is not order, I will stop the  proceedings completely.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Order. I must say that you are really all terrific parliamentarians.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Dr Paisley &mdash; once again &mdash; do you accept the nomination to  be First Minister on the restoration of devolved government?</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: Certainly not, Madam Speaker. It goes without saying that my  reasons are well known across this Province, and they have been endorsed by the  majority of unionist voters.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Thank you, Dr Paisley. I remind Members that Standing Order 15(d) requires that  both candidates state that they accept nomination. That has not occurred. The  nomination is, therefore, invalid, and falls.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Is there any further proposal?</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The time for proposals has expired.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: On  a point of order, Madam Speaker. In accordance with the bizarre and sectarian  voting rules that apply for this particular election, it is clear that the only  proposal that could command what is laughingly described as a cross-community  majority will not be achieved today. I presume that you will be informing the  Secretary of State of the outcome. Will you also inform him of the need to  convene immediate, inclusive and intensive all-party talks to deal with the  outstanding issues?</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Ford. As did Dr Paisley, you have anticipated my next remarks. I  will notify the Secretary of State that no persons have been elected to hold  the offices of First Minister and of Deputy First Minister on the restoration  of devolved government.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">An Order Paper for tomorrow&rsquo;s business will be issued as  soon as the Secretary of State has made a referral under the 2006 Act. Copies  will be placed in Members&rsquo; pigeonholes.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  On a point of order, Madam Speaker. Is it not ridiculous that Northern Ireland  has been put through this charade today to satisfy the Secretary of State&rsquo;s  political machinations, which have failed, and failed miserably?</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  That is not really a point of order, Mr Paisley. Please sit down. We are  working under the Secretary of State&rsquo;s direction. Everybody knew what we were  going to be doing today.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 2.15 pm.</p>
