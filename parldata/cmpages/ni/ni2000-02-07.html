                Mr&nbsp;Benson should have declared an interest when tabling his
                question to the Minister of Education. I have taken advice on
                this matter from the Clerk to the Committee on Standards and
                Privileges, and I believe that there are grounds for Mrs
                Robinson’s point of order. I am therefore referring the matter
                to the Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr Benson is in his place, he will have

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will note the motion under Standing
                Order 70, which is item two on the Order Paper. Business motions
                of this kind are not subject to amendment or debate. The purpose
                of this motion is to suspend the Standing Order relating to
                Adjournment debates and breaks on Tuesdays, which are from three
                o’clock until six o’clock. Should the motion, standing in
                the name of Rev&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Ian Paisley and Mr&nbsp;P Robinson,
                in respect of exclusion receive sufficient support to be debated
                tomorrow without our changing Standing Orders, there would have
                to be a recess from three o’clock until six o’clock, despite
                there not being a subject for the Adjournment. This does not
                seem a particularly profitable way of proceeding, and it would
                not allow proper time for the debate. That is the basis on which

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assembly Bills that refer to reserved
                matters, as defined in schedule&nbsp;3 of the Northern Ireland
                Act 1998, require the consent of the Secretary of State before
                we may proceed under section 10 of the Act. It is my intention
                to seek approval for all such Bills after their introduction. In
                future, when a Bill contains provisions on reserved matters, its
                Second Stage appearance on the Order Paper will signify that the
                Secretary of State’s consent has been obtained.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill that we are about to debate contains
                a number of such reserved matters. On 25&nbsp;January
                I&nbsp;wrote to the Secretary of State seeking consent to
                proceed with consideration of the Bill. This was granted on
                26&nbsp;January. If the arrangements for the future are clear I
                will now proceed and call the Member in charge of the Bill to
                move the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Mr&nbsp;Mallon):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before addressing the important business
                before the Assembly I should like, on behalf of the Executive
                Committee and the Assembly, to express shock and anger at last
                night’s bombing in Irvinestown. This Assembly, along with the
                other institutions, was established as a result of a process
                designed to end violence on these islands, and last night’s
                act was a calculated attempt to place them in jeopardy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I&nbsp;beg to move, on my own behalf and on
                behalf of the First Minister,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That the Second Stage of the Equality
                (Disability, etc) Bill (NIA 4/2000) be agreed.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Second Stage provides an opportunity for
                a general debate on the Bill and for Members to vote on its
                principles. The Good Friday Agreement promised equality of
                opportunity for all, and this Bill is the first legislative step
                by the new Administration and the new Assembly towards
                delivering on that promise. It is my fervent hope that it will
                not be our last.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement’s promise of equality has
                engendered high expectations. At last, with the institutions of
                the agreement up and running, we have the chance to deliver on
                this promise and to live up to those expectations. Many people
                in this Chamber, myself included, have complained about how the
                delay in establishing the institutions has hindered the equality
                agenda. I&nbsp;ask some of the people involved in that delay —
                and they know who they are — to reflect on the high price that
                we will all pay if the institutions designed to implement that
                agenda are suspended because of the outdated dogma of the
                organisations to which they may be related. Throughout our
                society there are those who are marginalised, those who cannot
                participate and those whose voices go unheard. These people will
                be sold short if this Administration is unable to get its work
                under way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In any event, the Bill’s main purpose is to
                expand and strengthen the disability functions of the Equality
                Commission for Northern Ireland, and its provisions closely
                mirror those of the Disability Rights Commission Act 1999 in
                Britain. It will ensure that disabled people in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland have access to a disability rights
                enforcement body. To appreciate the significance of the Bill, we
                have to look back to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.
                That Act gives disabled people real and important protections
                against discrimination. Nonetheless, it is flawed. Perhaps the
                greatest and most controversial flaw is that it did not
                establish a body to enforce the new rights that it conferred on
                the disabled. At that time the Fair Employment Commission could
                enforce fair employment law. The Equal Opportunities Commission
                could enforce sex-discrimination law. Later the Commission for
                Racial Equality was established to enforce race relations law.
                Yet no similar body was created to enforce the rights of the
                disabled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Instead, the Act established the Northern
                Ireland Disability Council. However, the council was merely an
                advisory body; it had no real powers. Despite this, it did
                excellent work in raising our awareness of disability- related
                issues, and I would like to pay tribute to its members for their
                hard work and commitment to disability rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In October&nbsp;1999 the Fair Employment
                Commission, the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Commission
                for Racial Equality and the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Disability
                Council were merged into one body: the Equality Commission. This
                served to highlight the inequity of the situation. The Equality
                Commission was able to give assistance to those complaining of
                sex or religious discrimination but was powerless to do anything
                for the disabled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Bill seeks to remedy that inequity. It
                is a measure of the commitment that this Administration attaches
                to the cause of the disabled that we placed it at the top of our
                recently announced legislative programme. Yet the groundwork for
                it has been well laid. Indeed, it represents the culmination of
                many years of hard work and campaigning by disabled people,
                their representative organisations, Northern&nbsp;Ireland MPs
                and Assembly Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill, like the Disability Rights
                Commission Act, reflects proposals put forward by the UK
                Disability Rights Task Force on the role and function of a
                Disability Rights Commission. The Labour Government established
                the task force in December&nbsp;1976 to advise on how
                comprehensively civil rights for disabled people could be
                achieved and how enforceable they could be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monica&nbsp;Wilson, chief executive of
                Disability Action, represented Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s
                interests on the task force, and I would like to take this
                opportunity to thank her for her valuable contribution to its
                work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In March&nbsp;1998 the task force put forward
                proposals on the role and functions of a Disability Rights
                Commission. These formed the basis of the White Paper ‘Promoting
                Disabled People’s Rights — Creating a Disability Rights
                Commission fit for the twenty-first century’, which was
                launched in July&nbsp;1998. The White Paper made it clear that
                the Equality Commission should have powers similar to those of
                the proposed Disability Rights Commission in Great&nbsp;Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interested organisations in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland commented on the White Paper’s proposals
                and had an opportunity to discuss them at a special consultation
                conference in Belfast in October&nbsp;1998. At that conference
                there was widespread support for the principle of a commission
                to enforce disability rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Bill represents the outcome of that
                process. It is all the more important when one considers that it
                is estimated that there are more than 200,000&nbsp;disabled
                people in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. One in six&nbsp;adults in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland has a disability. That represents 17%,
                compared to 14% in Great&nbsp;Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill makes provision for the Equality
                Commission for Northern&nbsp;Ireland to assume a number of vital
                functions. First, it would oblige the commission to work to
                eliminate discrimination and promote equal opportunities for the
                disabled as well as to encourage good practice. This is crucial,
                given the low awareness of disability issues in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland and the formidable problems faced by the
                disabled in their day-to-day lives here. Research by the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland Disability Council shows that 50% of
                disabled people face difficulties in accessing services that the
                rest of us take for granted. Things that everybody should be
                able to do, such as going to the cinema, eating out, and going
                shopping, are difficult for them. Even more disturbing is that
                78% of those who experience difficulties are offered no help.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the Bill would allow the commission
                to help vindicate the rights of the disabled in practice by
                offering advice and support in taking cases and undertaking
                investigations. These new functions recognise basic realities.
                Disability discrimination law is too complex for many to
                understand, and litigation is often too expensive for many to
                afford.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, the Bill would enable the commission
                to perform a number of functions that would be good for the
                disabled and good for those who employ them or provide them with
                services. It would allow the commission to provide information
                and advice to employers and service providers and to prepare
                statutory codes of practice providing practical guidance on how
                to comply with the law. It would also allow the commission to
                arrange independent conciliation between service providers and
                the disabled. Because the Bill is aimed simply at ensuring that
                the existing law is complied with, it imposes no regulatory
                burdens on business.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fourthly, the Bill would oblige the Equality
                Commission to keep the Disability Discrimination Act under
                review. This is important, since we know that the Act has many
                shortcomings. These were identified by the Disability Rights
                Task Force in its second report ‘From Exclusion to Inclusion’.
                Already our junior Ministers have written to all Ministers in
                the Executive asking them to consider the task force
                recommendations and report back.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is my hope that the Assembly will be able
                to take these recommendations forward. Indeed, I wonder if it is
                desirable for the Assembly to consider equality laws more
                generally. We now have one Equality Commission, yet we have four
                separate equality laws. It might be better for us to create a
                new, single equality Act covering all forms of discrimination,
                based as far as possible on the highest standards of protection.
                But that is a matter for another day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, in this Bill we have also taken the
                opportunity to include some miscellaneous clauses in relation to
                the powers of the Equality Commission. The first is to provide
                for the terms and conditions of appointment of additional
                commissioners appointed to carry out formal investigations; the
                second is to enable the Equality Commission’s annual reports
                to be made on a financial-year basis, in line with its accounts;
                and the third is to amend the Fair Employment and Treatment
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 to enable the Equality Commission
                to continue investigations initiated by the Fair Employment
                Agency under the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976.
                The first two clauses require the consent of the Secretary of
                State. That consent has been obtained. All three clauses are
                technical in nature, and none is controversial.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All parties in Northern Ireland are committed
                to strengthening disability rights. The Equality Commission
                supports the legislation, as do Disability Action and other
                voluntary bodies in this field. Our aim is to have this new
                legislation come into force in Northern Ireland on the same day
                as in Britain: 25 April 2000. The Office of the First Minister
                and Deputy First Minister has worked to give this Bill priority,
                as has the Executive. I would be grateful if the Assembly were
                to do likewise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Assembly to approve this Second
                Stage of the Bill and to support the motion which will allow the
                Committee of the Centre to take the Committee Stage.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the first opportunity the House has
                had to consider the important issue of disability. I am
                conscious of the time, but I must tell the House that I will
                return to many of the issues I am touching on today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Good Friday Agreement had the foresight
                to affirm, in the human rights section,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the right to equal opportunity in all
                social and economic activity, regardless of class, creed,
                disability, gender or ethnicity.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inclusion of the disability issue in the
                agreement was ground-breaking for Northern Ireland. For the
                first time it shifted the definition of disability away from
                being a health issue, which it is not, to being one of human
                rights and equality. It is disappointing that the medical
                definition of &quot;disability&quot; has not been replaced by
                something more acceptable. The challenge for this House in the
                future will be to ensure that when discussing policy and
                legislation relating to disability, Members look at things from
                a very different perspective than that applied by civil servants
                when they were taking decisions in the past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the establishment of the Equality
                Commission. However, I am sure that the House will agree that,
                given the umbrella nature of the Commission, some safeguards
                will need to be put in place relating to the funding and
                structure of the new body, safeguards that will ensure that
                specific problems relating to disability are not lost or
                subsumed in the wider remit of the commission. Members must
                ensure that that will not happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 is
                already on the statute book. However, for this excellent law to
                have real teeth in the future it will be essential to establish
                an enforcement commission in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Without such
                enforcement it will not be possible to make serious inroads into
                the present levels of discrimination.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This House has much to do to empower and
                liberate disabled people in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Members have
                a responsibility to ensure that people with disabilities are
                able to play as full a role as possible in society. It is
                incumbent on this House to lead by example. In addressing the
                needs of the disabled, Members must start by making
                Parliament&nbsp;Buildings much more accessible. We must remember
                that disability is not manifested just in people using
                wheelchairs. The vast majority of disabled people in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland have a hidden disability. The time has
                come for this Building to be made more accessible, both inside
                and outside. Doorways, ramps, signage for the partially sighted,
                audio loops for those with hearing difficulties and provision
                for people with learning difficulties are issues which we can
                and must address. An audit of the Building has been carried out,
                but sadly it seems to have been buried somewhere. Why?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is nearly two&nbsp;years since the
                Assembly was set up, and a person with a disability still cannot
                use the front door. Interpreters have been employed for Irish
                and Ulster-Scots, but there is no sign language interpreter. The
                issue of access includes not just physical access to the
                Building but access throughout the Building.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Disability Discrimination Act remains a
                flawed piece of legislation. People with disabilities require
                full and comprehensive anti-discrimination measures, giving them
                full civil rights. The Assembly should state that this is its
                objective and should publish a timetable for the implementation
                of such a commitment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, Members should not forget that
                should the work of the House be suspended later this week, the
                effect on the disabled people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland will not
                be mentioned in the news headlines, but the impact of the
                suspension of the institutions will be immense. As the rest of
                the UK and Ireland moves ahead with the equality agenda,
                disabled people here will have nothing in place to assist them.
                This must not be allowed to happen. In the coming weeks, it is
                to be hoped, our hopes will overcome our fears so that we can
                set about underpinning the new beginning by enabling people to
                have full access to Parliament&nbsp;Buildings and the democratic
                process — access in the most liberal sense.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that the Equality
                (Disability, etc) Bill addresses a great many of the issues
                which for many years have lain buried beneath equality
                legislation. Aspects of religious discrimination were addressed
                in the 1970s and 1980s — whether satisfactorily is a matter
                for another debate. The gender issue has also been addressed,
                and progress has been made in that area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, before the passing of the Disability
                Discrimination Act 1995 no serious attempt was made by society
                either in Northern&nbsp;Ireland or in the United&nbsp;Kingdom to
                address disability discrimination. There has been substantial
                progress since 1995. Greater awareness has been shown by
                employers, and there has been significant progress on aspects of
                access to public places. However, there is much, much more that
                can be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome what the
                Deputy&nbsp;First&nbsp;Minister said about the numbers of people
                involved. Very often society thinks — as was the case in the
                1970s and 1980s — that only a small minority of people are
                affected by disability. The fact is that in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland one in every six adults has some form of
                disability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a huge problem that is only beginning
                to be addressed, and this Bill will go some way towards doing
                that. I hope that the Committee of the Centre, in conjunction
                with Disability Action — I have talked to Monica&nbsp;Wilson
                of that group — and the other interest groups that are
                involved can address some of the issues that are referred to,
                albeit not in sufficient detail, in the Bill. If we are still
                here and get to the Committee Stage, I&nbsp;hope that we can
                bring back a Bill that everyone is able to accept.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does Mr&nbsp;Campbell agree that the issue of
                leading by example in respect of this Building, as referred to
                by Ms&nbsp;Lewsley, should be addressed? There has to be a more
                disability-friendly attitude towards access to Parliament
                Buildings. We should not put demands on other businesses
                throughout the Province without giving a lead ourselves. Many
                people would frown on any other approach.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree entirely. Only in recent years have
                local authorities begun to make access for the disabled an
                important issue. If this Building, which is regarded as the
                premier public building in Northern Ireland, is inaccessible in
                any way to those with a disability, some people will say
                &quot;We hear what you are saying, but what action are you
                taking in relation to Parliament Buildings?&quot; We should look
                urgently at this matter — it should not have to await the
                deliberations on the Disability Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other disabled persons have said that
                inaccessibility in public places is still a problem. This matter
                has not seen the progress that it should have since the
                1995&nbsp;Act. Even over the last five&nbsp;years disabled
                persons have had restricted access to public buildings. Public
                buildings should be as freely accessible to the disabled as to
                others. I&nbsp;welcome the Bill. Even if we cannot debate it in
                full, I welcome its coming into effect in the near future.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Second Stage of the Equality
                (Disability, etc) Bill. It is imperative that the needs and the
                rights of the disabled be fully recognised. I, like other
                Members, am disappointed that this Building is still
                inaccessible to wheelchair users.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill does not go far enough, but it will
                allow us to further the debate and put what we have discussed
                into practice. Unfortunately, the disabled do not have a strong
                voice. Often they have to rely on Members to speak for them. I
                have invited the Southern Forum for Disability to come to the
                Assembly on 13&nbsp;March. I know that I should not be plugging
                this visit now, but I&nbsp;ask all Members to come and meet
                members of this group and hear what they have to say.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is regrettable, given that equality is
                being placed with the Committee of the Centre — and its
                Chairman has talked about leading by example — that that
                Committee has not been able to get off the ground because of the
                inequalities that are practised in it. I find it hypocritical
                that the Chairman can say that he is leading by example, yet
                treating members of that Committee in a disparaging fashion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The disability issue needs to be given more
                time in the Assembly. Debating this issue is one thing, but
                unless we put what we say into practice the Bill will not be
                worth the paper that it is written on.</p>

                improving the situation of people with disabilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that the legislation is specifically
                designed to include such areas as employment and access to
                goods, facilities and premises means that a large section of the
                community will be supported by the law in their attempts to
                increase their active participation in public life. It will take
                much work, as the Deputy First Minister and other Members have
                said, on the part of the Government, the Equality Commission
                and, of course, employers and providers of services to ensure

                detailed comments until the Bill gets to Committee Stage. If the
                Committee of the Centre gets off the ground, I hope that it will
                be discussed there. I am not sure whether that will happen, but
                the matter should be dealt with urgently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this legislation, which will

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before devolution, there was a discussion
                about merging the various equality commissions. My party’s
                argument was that that should not happen. It was our belief, and
                it remains our belief, that there should be a hierarchy of
                equality in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. It will probably still be the
                case that religious and political identity will top that
                hierarchy, and because of the activism of those involved with
                sex discrimination we may find that gender and race will come
                next; disability will come at the bottom of the ladder. With the
                merger of existing bodies into the Equality Commission, that is
                something that concerns us. Indeed, we will scrutinise this new
                Equality Commission to see that disability is given the
                treatment that it will have in Great&nbsp;Britain, that it will
                have its own commission, its own resources, its own secretariat
                and its own investigatory powers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the legislation in that, for the
                first time, it allows the commission to undertake formal
                investigations. It is my belief that although people would have
                paid lip-service to the legislation, without that power they
                probably would not have done anything to enforce it. For me, it
                is not just about passing the legislation but also about
                monitoring, evaluating and enforcing it. There should also be
                penalties in place when people do not sign up to it. That is the
                way we can change not only people’s attitudes but also their
                behaviour towards those who are disabled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remain concerned about the Committee of the
                Centre and its current inability to function. I note that there
                is a proposal to refer the Bill to that Committee, but as it is
                currently not functioning I do not think we should have to refer
                it there if we want it passed as quickly as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those of us in the Health, Social Services
                and Public Safety Committee thought that it was the more
                appropriate Committee to which to refer this Bill. However, the
                Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment Committee
                would also be appropriate. I can understand that those who were
                trying to decide which Committee the Bill would be best placed
                with finally decided that since equality crossed all of those
                Departments —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept all the points the Member has made
                about the so-called hierarchy of concern in relation to various
                disadvantages in the community, but, given the importance of
                this Bill, does she agree that it would be a disaster for those
                who suffer from disability if the Committee of the Centre were
                unable to deal effectively with the legislation?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the point I am trying to make. I am
                greatly concerned that that Committee will be unable to deal
                with the legislation. There may come a time when the matter has
                to be referred to another Committee that can deal with it more
                effectively. Perhaps we should propose that the Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety Committee take the Bill forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those of us on other Committees will need to
                look at this matter very carefully. The Committee of the Centre
                does not have a representative from every party, though those of
                us in the smaller parties came together in order to facilitate
                representation on that Committee. The smaller parties need a
                mechanism for liaising about how other Committees could pick up
                aspects of this legislation. This is a matter of major concern.
                I am putting down a marker that if the Committee of the Centre
                is not functioning we need to take serious notice of that fact
                and find a more appropriate Committee to consider the
                legislation.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee of the Centre will meet on
                Wednesday at 2.00 pm, when there will be a full programme of
                business. We hope we get this chance. That is what the Committee
                is for.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend this Bill to the Assembly for a
                number of reasons. Disability affects everyone. Those of us who
                are in full possession of our faculties are nonetheless very
                conscious of those who are not. For this reason alone, the Bill
                is worthy of recommendation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our duty as elected representatives is to
                look after those in society who are less well off and those who
                need help, and today we have an opportunity to do that. People
                with disabilities have been ignored for years; the able-bodied
                have closed their eyes to them or turned their heads. However,
                some people have worked very hard to bring the disability issue
                to the attention of the public and their elected
                representatives, and they should be commended.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not everyone is able-bodied or has full
                possession of his or her faculties. It is important, therefore,
                that elected representatives recognise the Disability
                Discrimination Act 1995. We want to improve the quality of life
                of the disabled. That is our goal and our responsibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One Member has said that one in every six
                adults has a disability. This should put the issue into
                perspective. Our duty is to do our best for these people,
                whether they are senior citizens or folk with mental, physical
                or learning disabilities. It is important that every opportunity
                be afforded to them all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One thing which concerns me is that the care
                which has been available over the last 10&nbsp;years is not as
                good or extensive as it should have been, and the number of beds
                in residential homes has decreased. Why? Is it because the
                Government have been hoping that more people will volunteer to
                look after those who are less well off?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of my friends have children with
                Down’s syndrome. They do not regard their children as having a
                disability; they look on them as being a special gift. Perhaps
                we should be looking at this issue in that way. Those who have
                this disability and have a real need for help from society
                should be given the opportunity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another big issue which is raised in our
                advice centre is that of public accessibility, whether of this
                Building or of other public buildings such as council offices.
                Ards Borough Council installed a lift as part of its last scheme
                for the town hall. This made the building disability-friendly,
                and people who are wheelchair-bound can have access to all its
                facilities. That is our council’s policy, and I hope that many
                other councils will adopt a similar one.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third issue that I would like to
                highlight relates to those who are in need of benefits. Over the
                years they have been discriminated against in many ways. Through
                our advice centre we have had the opportunity to hear some of
                their problems — the problems of people who are in need of
                benefits and who are not getting all they are entitled to. We
                want to highlight that issue. The week before last, we heard of
                a lady who had a disabled brother and who, for 31 years of his
                life, got no financial assistance whatsoever. There is something
                seriously wrong there, and we must address such issues. I
                commend this to Members for their consideration, and I look
                forward to meeting them on Wednesday and discussing these
                issues.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support Prof McWilliams’s point that this
                Bill should have been referred to the Health, Social Services
                and Public Safety Committee. The Disability Discrimination Act
                1995 came about largely through embarrassment and public
                pressure on the Conservative Government. For years prior to
                that, Private Members’ Bills were brought before the House of
                Commons and were either directly opposed by the Government or
                not given the time or space for discussion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I very much welcome this Bill. For the first
                time disabled people have the power of investigation, and the
                law is on their side. Like the Deputy First Minister, I
                congratulate Mrs&nbsp;Wilson, who has led this campaign for many
                years. My Committee, and I am sure every Member in the Assembly,
                will be very carefully monitoring how the legislation is acted
                upon on behalf of those who are disabled.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My apologies, Mr Speaker. If that is my only
                wrong utterance I will be most gratified. There are often errors
                of a much more substantial nature.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyhow, Mr Speaker, I wish to endorse what
                the Deputy First Minister stated — that we view this Bill as
                being of such importance that it has been placed at the top of
                the legislative programme. I wish to put on record my thanks to
                Monica&nbsp;Wilson for her contribution. I also note that the
                Chairman of the Committee of the Centre looks forward to
                engaging with Monica&nbsp;Wilson in deliberation on the Bill at
                the Committee Stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The whole thrust of the Bill is to add powers
                to the Equality Commission. I was struck by Ms&nbsp;Lewsley’s
                comment that it was not so much to do with health as with
                rights. Indeed, there was a thread running through the
                discussion as to whether this was a health issue. Some Members
                said that it should be for the Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety Committee as distinct from the Committee of the
                Centre.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, that matter will be deliberated by
                the Committee of the Centre. The main aim of the Bill is to
                create a body to which people in Northern&nbsp;Ireland can turn
                for assistance. Every organisation or entity in Northern Ireland
                must provide facilities for the disabled. The Committee
                Chairman, Mr&nbsp;Campbell, said that people hearing our words
                will be asking what we are doing about Parliament Buildings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms&nbsp;Lewsley raised the question of
                funding, which is always uppermost in many minds. We are in
                consultation with the Department of Finance and Personnel about
                this. The Member is right in wanting the disabled to be
                liberated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairman of the Committee of the Centre
                pointed to the fact that one in six people is disabled. Another
                Member said that not all disabled people have a wheelchair. We
                must be very conscious of that. Patricia Lewsley said that the
                vast majority have a hidden disability, which is also something
                that we must address. She asked about the timetable too. We hope
                that the Equality Commission in Northern&nbsp;Ireland will
                assume responsibility for additional disability rights at the
                same time as the Disability Rights Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Questions were also asked about this
                Buildings. One Member said that you cannot even get through the
                front door easily. The Assembly Commission is currently
                addressing that matter. It is to be hoped that there will soon
                be much easier access for the disabled to this Building.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms&nbsp;McWilliams raised the issue of
                funding. She said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;religious and political identity will
                top that hierarchy&quot;,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">and added that disability will come at the
                bottom. I assure Members that disability will not be at the
                bottom of the agenda. The Deputy First Minister said that the
                fact that this is the first item for the Assembly means that it
                is at the top of the agenda.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At workshops on inequality I was heartened to
                hear how people were bringing matters to do with inequality and
                disability to the fore. I note Members’ concerns about
                bringing all the agencies under one umbrella — the Equality
                Commission. I also note Prof&nbsp;McWilliams’s concern that
                the remits of the former commissions would be subsumed under the
                greater body. I assure her that that will not be the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have covered most of the comments that were
                made. Any that I have not addressed I will determine from
                Hansard and address them in detail later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of this applies because many questions
                were raised about the Assembly Building. Every public utility
                and every organisation must make provision for the disabled, so
                the Bill will apply to the Assembly Building. There is therefore
                responsibility on us as well as on everyone else. That is why I
                reiterate what Mr Campbell said: words from this Building are
                not enough; we must have action on disability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to restate the Assembly’s commitment
                to disabled people in Northern Ireland. We wish to ensure that
                they have access to a disability rights enforcement body no
                later than their peers in the rest of the United Kingdom.
                Enforcing disability rights is another step towards achieving
                equality of opportunity. That goes to the heart of the Belfast
                Agreement, which was not just for the able-bodied.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill will reinforce the Disability
                Discrimination Act by providing mechanisms for rights to be
                enforced more effectively. It will put the enforcement of
                disability rights on a par with the enforcement of rights in the
                other main areas of anti-discrimination law: fair employment,
                gender and race. There will be equality — no hierarchy of
                equality but equality of opportunity for all.</p>

                mind with this question. EU payments must comply with state-aid
                rules. Those rules relate to all state payments, whether EU-funded
                or not, and to industry in general. They apply across the
                European Union, and their purpose is to prevent member states
                putting their industries at an unfair advantage by paying state
                subsidies. Northern&nbsp;Ireland Ministers will be able to
                influence decisions on the reform of state-aid rules as they
                fall due for such reform, but at the moment, we have to work
                with them as they presently stand.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Murphy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the rural farming community there is a
                real sense that the rules and regulations coming from Brussels
                are unduly inhibiting and are resulting in a decrease in the
                amount of money going into that community. Will the Minister
                assure us that in any negotiations with the European Union she
                and her officials will do what other member states do — try to
                negotiate as much flexibility as possible into the delivery of
                European payments? There is a real sense that money is being
                lost, and although these may be small grants, when taken across
                the industry as a whole they add up to a substantial sum each
                year.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have already stated, when the next round
                falls due, I will ensure that our voice is heard. Flexibility is
                not a route that is open to us at present. Once the rules have
                been agreed, they apply equally across the European Union, and
                we have to be careful that we do not fall outside them. Were we
                to do so, we would be penalised, which would leave us in a worse
                situation.</p>

                farmers in Northern&nbsp;Ireland? The sheep annual premium is
                calculated on a European-wide basis, as opposed to a regional
                basis, and consequently farmers are losing £7 to
                £8&nbsp;per&nbsp;head. Does she intend to support the Irish

                entrants to the industry and established farmers unable to
                receive compensation. Will the Minister commit some of the
                £30&nbsp;million of additional money secured under the
                modulation scheme from 2001 to 2006 to the development of an
                early-retirement scheme for farmers or to a young entrants’

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under modulation it is open to me to have an
                early-retirement scheme, but if I were to use the modulation
                money for such a scheme, there would be nothing left for
                anything else. The industry has made it clear to me that it
                wants the maximum number of winners and the minimum number of
                losers. If I were to opt for the early-retirement scheme most of
                the money would be going to a small number of farmers — about
                740, I believe — leaving 29,000 out. Much as I would like to
                have such a scheme, I believe that the industry itself would
                consider it on the whole unfair when taken across the board.</p>

                labelling was discussed at the last agriculture council meeting

                the question, I do not think that the agri-food industry, the

                competition with each other. One of the problems for pig farmers
                at present is the lack of processing capacity following the
                burning of the Lovell&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Christmas factory.
                Therefore if the processors are moving and improving,
                opportunities are being created for the farmers. I see them as

                the long term if any extra funding is used as an incentive for
                lower production, as excess production has been the principal

                (OFS) and the countryside management scheme (CMS) depends
                largely on the additional funds delivered by modulation. I will

                shortfall in the budget, as expected revenue from the forest
                service was not realised. This was because of the high price of
                sterling and the damage done to the forests by the 1998 storm. A
                shortfall occurred in that budget, and that had to be rectified.
                Therefore what looked like giving money to the forest service
                was really using money to plug a gap in the budget. This had to

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Intervention Board Executive Agency
                operates the over-30-month slaughter scheme. It is therefore
                outside my responsibility as Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development. I have referred the Member’s question to the
                chief executive of that agency, and I have asked him to provide
                an answer direct to the Member.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understood that when this contract was put
                out the payment to the farmer was to have been made in less than
                four&nbsp;weeks. I know for a fact that many of these payments
                take two months to issue. That is totally wrong.
                Three&nbsp;months ago they seemed to be on top of the problem,
                but now, whenever people have their cattle taken away and they
                enquire about the delay in payments, they are told that the
                computers were down. That is not a valid excuse, and it needs to
                be investigated very seriously. I understand that the firms that
                lift the cattle get the cheque but hold it back for a time and
                use the money for themselves. That is the information I have
                been given, and I have no reason to disbelieve it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Drift-net licence fees in the Foyle area are
                higher than those in the Republic of Ireland, but there are good
                reasons for that. Fishing during the permitted period is very
                intensive and effective, so the number of licences is limited in
                the interests of conserving and protecting salmon stocks. The
                Loughs Agency has done much to enhance the productivity of the
                Foyle system to the benefit of all fishery interests in that
                catchment area. The fee also reflects the agency’s need to
                meet as much of its running costs as possible.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his response. Who
                sits on that project team, and why is the Ulster Museum not
                staging a major exhibition as it did when it commemorated the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will take the second part of the question
                first. The museum has little artefactual evidence of
                consequence, and that is its difficulty with staging an
                exhibition along the lines of the ’98&nbsp;exhibition.
                However, that is one of the areas to be looked at by the working
                group I am establishing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are aware that some artefacts are
                available — for example, the Broighter&nbsp;Horde that was
                discovered in the River&nbsp;Bann in the 1890s, which is in the
                National Museum in Dublin. We will be looking for an opportunity
                to display that. Interestingly, that display is in the National
                Museum as a result of the intervention of Edward,
                Lord&nbsp;Carson, who persuaded the British Museum to send it
                back to Dublin, whence it had come. The Public Record Office of
                Northern Ireland also holds a large collection of Lord&nbsp;Castlereagh’s
                papers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, we are aware that a table
                purchased by the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Government in 1957, on
                which it is likely that the Royal Assent to the Act of Union was
                given by Lord&nbsp;Cornwallis, the Lord&nbsp;Lieutenant of
                Ireland, is available. It is in storage and in the possession of
                this Administration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are some of the artefacts that we have
                been able to discover so far. I intend to ensure that the
                working group explores what can be collated for display.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the virtual library project,
                the membership has already been established. This was completed
                before the current Executive and Administration took over. The
                membership comprises the Public Record Office, Queens University
                library, the Linenhall Library and the National Museums and
                Galleries of Northern&nbsp;Ireland. They are working on the
                production of a virtual library project and in doing this they
                are receiving assistance with digitalisation from experts in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland and the British Library. It is believed
                that this is a powerful way of telling the story of the Act of
                Union.</p>

                Dublin I spoke to Miss&nbsp;de&nbsp;Valéra about the
                possibility of migrating various exhibitions. The reason for my
                trip was to open an exhibition called &quot;The Way We
                Wore&quot;, which, I believe, is as relevant to people in
                Belfast as to those in Dublin. My suggestion about migration
                met, I believe, with a favourable response, and there is no
                reason why some of the very important artefacts held in the
                National&nbsp;Museum should not also migrate for exhibition in

                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. The cost of the project is
                £91·1&nbsp;million. Private funding accounts for
                £16·9&nbsp;million, and the balance will come from a variety
                of sources. The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure will put
                in £16·9&nbsp;million; the Millennium Commission will

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are very considerable sums. In terms of

                events including those of a sporting nature. The arena will seat
                more than 10,000&nbsp;people. A state-of-the-art science centre
                will be a high-technology venture, and it will tell a science

                ensure that this great project for Northern&nbsp;Ireland does

                public money is being wisely spent, and will the project be

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be unwise to give an opinion, since
                this was a provision that was made long before the Department of
                Culture, Arts and Leisure was established. It is a very
                considerable sum of money, and there was a great deal of debate
                about the provision. The Millennium Commission determined that
                this was the bid best suited to Northern&nbsp;Ireland, and I am
                a great believer in not looking a gift horse in the mouth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are possible revenue consequences for
                us, and the Department has budgeted for deficit funding of up to
                £450,000 a year for the science centre. This is based on a
                total visit of under 3&nbsp;million for the outlets and
                facilities in the Odyssey project, and in respect of the
                science&nbsp;centre, we are looking at a figure of 221,000 a
                year. We are not clear at this stage how much of that will be
                concessions to school-children, and so on, and how much will be
                attributed to fee-paying customers. The figure of £450,000 is a
                guesstimate of the total liability to the Department. The others
                are expected to be operated as private ventures by private
                operators and will not represent a drain on the public purse.</p>

                missed this — extends only to the public-sector parts of the
                project? Or is it intended that, for example, the arena will
                need public-sector subsidy, or, indeed, the bus service which is
                to bring people from all around the city to the facility, which

                doing, I will take into account the provision of the Football
                (Offences) Act&nbsp;1991. Similar legislation here would make it
                an offence to engage in unruly, indecent and sectarian behaviour
                at sporting events and would seek to deter unacceptable and
                disruptive behaviour among those attending sporting events.</p>

                activity without threat of intimidation? Does he agree that
                sectarianism in Northern&nbsp;Ireland is equivalent to racism in
                football grounds across the water and is amenable to similar

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not prepared to equate racism and
                sectarianism. However, I agree with Mr&nbsp;McCarthy that this
                is a problem which needs to be addressed. The Sports Council and
                the IFA are currently discussing this issue and looking for ways
                and means of addressing it. As I said, we will be looking at the
                Football (Offences) Act&nbsp;1991, which is applicable in the
                rest of the UK. We will also be looking at another Order, which
                came in a few years later, making it illegal, for example, to
                throw any object towards the pitch or a spectator area without
                lawful authority or excuse — I am surprised this is not the
                case at present — to take part in indecent or racist chanting
                or to go on to the pitch without lawful authority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the 1999 amendments it is also an
                offence for an individual to engage in racist or indecent
                chanting, either alone or in concert with others. It is clearly
                a matter for legislation and also for those who operate the
                grounds. There are 20&nbsp;football grounds, seven Gaelic
                grounds and one rugby ground. There has never been a problem in
                the rugby ground. There can be in some of the others, but most
                grounds are free from such behaviour and such chanting. It is
                essentially a management problem in the various stadiums, but we
                will be looking at legislation where appropriate.</p>

                to be done outside the legislative process in terms of
                education, not just in schools but in adult education as well?
                This could perhaps be in the form of a PR presentation to try to
                get the damage that sectarianism does to our society across to
                the community at large. Might it not also be a further argument
                in favour of creating a neutral national stadium in which at
                least the international competitions could be run without the
                blight of secretarianism?</p>

                disappear. With regard to the sports grounds, I have already
                said that that this may be a management problem in the stadiums
                where it exists. The IFA, for example, takes this seriously and

                Council? Only 3% of that funding has gone to football, whereas
                49% has gone to the GAA. Would he admit that that could be a
                cause for concern, if not dissent, among a large number of
                people? Will the Minister investigate that and say what redress

                grants that I have so far looked at are equitable and fair.
                Perhaps Mr&nbsp;Gibson is highlighting a West Tyrone problem

                take the Minister in a completely different direction, and he

                Nationalists to opt for the FAI and to play for the Republic of
                Ireland rather than Northern Ireland. It was suggested that
                perhaps the FAI was engaged in some underhand tactics to poach
                young players. Does the Minister agree that a more likely
                explanation is the sectarian atmosphere of Windsor Park, which
                many people from a Nationalist background find a completely
                hostile venue for either playing or watching?</p>

                than to say to Mr&nbsp;Murphy that the current
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland soccer team clearly does not have a
                problem about attracting young Nationalists to play for it. The
                question was about the ability of the IFA to attract young
                footballers from a perceived Nationalist background to play for
                the Northern&nbsp;Ireland soccer team, but it is quite clear
                that the IFA’s capability to do that is one of its strengths.
                I do not agree that a sectarian element is impeding the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland soccer team from performing to the best of
                its ability.</p>

                ground — it is not just in soccer grounds, as the Member is
                aware — is unacceptable to us all. I repeat that the IFA and
                the Sports Council take this matter very seriously and are

                assume that the Member is referring to work carried out under
                the EU-funded Erne salmon management programme. Of the
                7&nbsp;million juvenile salmon stocked into the Erne catchment
                area under this programme, the distribution was 33% in Northern

                Northern&nbsp;Ireland fisheries. The objective of the Erne
                salmon management programme is to reintroduce a self-sustaining
                population of wild salmon to the Erne to support a quality
                salmon-rod fishery. I am aware that there is a problem with
                returning adults to the system, and I will address this with my

                some figures. I too have some figures. Will the Minister comment
                on the widely held view that it is unfair that in 1997, 1·2
                million salmon ova and fry were stocked in Erne feeder streams
                in Northern&nbsp;Ireland and that in 1995-96 just over

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think the Minister has more than enough to
                answer.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think the question concerned the stocking
                of the Erne catchment area with approximately 1·7&nbsp;million
                fry. With a normal migration return of 10% one would expect
                there to be 170,000 coming back. The figures show there are a
                very small number coming back into the Erne estuary. The salmon
                management programme is meant to investigate why the wild salmon
                fishing industry has virtually collapsed in the Erne catchment
                area over the last 35&nbsp;years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At roughly the same time in the 1960s the
                Ballyshannon hydroelectric dams were introduced. While they had
                proper fish traps to allow the salmon to migrate, there is
                concern that this is why the smolts are not able to leave the
                system and get into the sea and why, when they make the return,
                they cannot get into the Erne catchment area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The salmon management programme is under way,
                and I expect a report by June this year. The report should
                confirm the belief that there has been a dramatic reduction in
                migration. This is the reason for the lack of salmon in the
                lakes. The next stage will be to investigate the reasons. We
                hope this investigation will be carried out with the
                co-operation of the Electricity Supply Board around the area of
                the Ballyshannon hydro-works. This contributes roughly 1% of the
                electricity in the Irish Republic and appears to be contributing
                to the reduction in the wild salmon runs in the lough.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Deputy First Minister for his
                answer. He will be aware that the Irish Government’s policy on
                decentralisation may place up to 10,000 public-sector jobs in
                rural constituencies and border areas, where their impact on the

                relocating up to 10,000 public-service jobs out of Dublin to the
                western, midland and border counties. This will come on top of
                the 4,000 which have been relocated since 1986. I am sure that
                this will have a very positive economic impact on those regions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member asked specifically about the
                Northern Ireland staffing levels in Belfast, Newry and Armagh.
                Staffing levels, as he knows, are given by district council
                area. Belfast City Council has 14,715 Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                Civil Service staff in its area, constituting 62%. Armagh has
                247, which is 1%, and the Newry and Mourne area has 336, which
                represents 1.4%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member’s knowledge of working
                population statistics for those areas mentioned will enable him
                to identify the disparities properly. He will also be aware that
                the North/South Ministerial Council recently announced that the
                headquarters of the Trade and Business Development Body would be
                in Newry. This will lead to approximately 40&nbsp;jobs. The
                North/South Ministerial Secretariat is already established in
                Armagh, and the number of civil servants to be located there is
                under the consideration of the respective Ministers of Finance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I am aware of the attractions of

                specifically. The figure for Derry is 1,142 or 4·8%. Omagh has
                545, which is 2·3%. Four&nbsp;hundred of the jobs that have
                gone to Derry have gone there recently. The lesson that we
                should all learn from this is that we must look at it in its
                totality and in terms of what should be considered when deciding
                the location of government functions. We need to try to ensure

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do. As I have already said, responsibility
                for the location of offices within the Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                Civil Service is a matter for the Minister of Finance and
                Personnel. The Member, like others, will also be aware that
                equality and the new TSN are factors to be taken into account in
                future accommodation planning, as are such factors as the
                regional planning strategy, service delivery and cost. I fully

                105&nbsp;Civil Service jobs — less than 0·5% — feels that
                it has a case to make. Many other towns — not only border
                towns — also have cases to make, and I look forward to hearing
                them. The decision to locate the North/South Implementation
                Bodies’ headquarters in Enniskillen, Newry, Derry and Omagh

                under-representation of Government offices in Newtownabbey,

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the Member’s point that there
                should not be relocation at the expense of families or people.
                This has been one of the factors that have been applied in the
                Republic of Ireland. Those moves have been made on a voluntary
                basis with no compulsion on staff, and that must happen here.
                The implication of the Member’s question is that there are
                many places in the North of Ireland that have to be looked at,
                including Newtownabbey. When potential members of staff and
                members of the Civil&nbsp;Service look at the attraction of all

                Does he agree that the biggest challenge facing everyone in
                Northern Ireland, including the Assembly, is to devise an
                enterprise-driven regional approach to the economy? Does he
                accept that the economic policy unit has a central role in
                co-ordinating that and making sure that we have better
                value-added production so that we can lessen our dependence on

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree entirely with the Member. The
                challenge is to shift away from subsidy-based activity, from the
                public sector to the private sector, and within the private
                sector to higher-value-added areas. This is the key objective
                for the future. The work of the Administration needs to be
                focused on that. We need the capacity to co-ordinate policies
                across Departments to avoid the silo effect that has slipped
                into some elements of the Administration.</p>

                Mr Byrne was making. It is essential that we refocus the economy
                in that way. The best cure for social exclusion is a well-paid

                role of the economic policy unit is to assist him and the Deputy
                First Minister, its funding appears to be a matter for the
                Department of Finance and Personnel? Will he say to which of the
                House Committees the economic policy unit will be accountable
                and explain how we will deal with the complicated matter of
                communication between the economic policy unit and the

                communication. The two elements will work closely together. In
                essence, the economic policy unit, which has a co-ordinating
                role, is located in the Centre and consequently is subject to
                oversight by the Committee of the Centre. It is clear that the
                Administration needs something equivalent to the Cabinet
                Secretariat in Downing Street, which has a Minister. However, I
                would not like to draw an analogy between Mr&nbsp;Haughey and
                Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt on one hand and the Cabinet’s Minister of

                between universities and industry and partnerships between the
                universities, industry and the Government, so that research can
                be placed in the technological chain which leads to development
                and entrepreneurism. It has worked in less-developed regions in
                Europe, and it can, and will, be made to work here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will be aware that we have
                inherited a level of university research funding that is low in
                comparison with that in other regions. However, our universities
                are now benefiting from substantial new investment in research
                across the United&nbsp;Kingdom. In the current academic year
                this includes an additional £1·5&nbsp;million for research
                infrastructure, £2&nbsp;million of university challenge money
                and part of the investment of £10&nbsp;million towards the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland science park.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This additional new funding is helpful, but
                Northern Ireland is lagging behind, as the council has pointed
                out. We will have to ensure that industry, the private sector,
                the public sector and the education sector are equipped to deal
                with research and development because, in today’s world, we

                provides, for the first time, a statutory right of access to
                information held by a wide range of Northern Ireland public
                bodies in the transferred field, including Departments, district
                councils and executive and advisory non-departmental public
                bodies. It also provides for the enforcement of that right of
                access and for an appeals procedure.</p>

                However, freedom of information is a transferred matter, and it
                is for the Executive Committee to decide whether to introduce
                separate legislation on freedom of information in Northern

                community sectors, the churches, culture, arts and sports,
                victims, community relations and education. In addition, as
                First and Deputy First Ministers, we will appoint six persons
                and the chairperson. Our nominees will be people who, in our

                will inform the deliberations of the Forum in the social,
                economic and cultural spheres. We will ensure that the Forum has

                been received. The Office of the First Minister and Deputy First
                Minister is very aware of the victims. We have already had a
                meeting with the Minister of State, who shares that
                responsibility with us, and we have taken steps to ensure that
                there is a dedicated sector in the equality unit to deal with
                the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make a final point in relation
                about the sting in the Member’s question. In many ways we are
                all victims of the past 30 years, and there are many groups that
                have suffered in various ways. We will ensure, through the
                equality unit and the nominations put forward for the Civic
                Forum, that all groups are represented, in the wider interests
                of everyone in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Assembly calls on Her Majesty’s
                Government to proclaim each year St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day a
                public holiday in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to explain to the Assembly the words
                of the motion. Unfortunately, under current constitutional
                arrangements, the declaring of public holidays remains a
                responsibility of the British Government. Therefore,
                regrettably, it is not possible for the Assembly to take a
                decision on the matter. The only course of action open to us is
                to lobby our Prime Minister and our Secretary of State directly
                and hope that the Taoiseach and the Irish Government can also
                use their good offices to enable us to achieve the desired
                result. The Assembly does, however, have an important
                representative role in that it can express the authoritative
                voice of the people of Northern Ireland to other levels of
                government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why should the Assembly push for
                St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day to be made a public holiday? Put simply,
                St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day is an important day for people
                throughout Northern&nbsp;Ireland. It celebrates the man who is
                historically associated with bringing Christianity to Ireland.
                His importance is recognised by Protestants, Catholics and many
                others. St&nbsp;Patrick is the great unifier.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day is also significant
                in a number of non-religious ways throughout the island.
                Throughout the world it is regarded as Ireland’s national day,
                North and South. Around the world it is something for people of
                Irish descent to celebrate. And why not?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern&nbsp;Ireland many people from all
                traditions wear shamrock. Indeed, shamrock is traditionally
                presented to the Irish regiments every St Patrick’s Day.
                Sometimes at parades and festivals we have the great traditions
                of music, Irish food and green Guinness, which are enjoyed by
                many people. More importantly, religious services are celebrated
                throughout the length and breadth of the island, and it is also
                the day on which schools’ cup rugby, soccer and gaelic
                football finals are played.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that St&nbsp;Patrick’s
                Day contributes to tourism in Ireland, both North and South,
                which is so important to our economic well-being. I welcome the
                news that the Apprentice Boys of Derry are planning a
                St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day festival this year and are to encourage
                their members to wear shamrock. That is progress that we can all
                support. I draw the House’s attention to the fact that the
                Apprentice Boys are set to go green for St&nbsp;Paddy’s Day.
                Who could fault people for that? Quite rightly they are
                recognising that St Patrick’s Day is a celebration for the
                whole community, and not just for one part of it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">St Patrick’s Day is a bigger event in some
                parts of the world than here, especially where there are large
                populations of Irish descent. One of the biggest annual parades
                is in New York, and there are parades in many other American
                towns and cities as well. The St Patrick’s Day pilgrimage to
                the White House is now an annual event for many of our leading
                politicians, and they all seem to enjoy the festivities. Surely
                it is strange that St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day is celebrated more
                enthusiastically internationally than at home and that it
                remains only a bank holiday, not a public holiday, in Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some workers, such as civil servants, bankers
                and, indeed, Assembly Members, will have the day off and can
                join in the celebrations. But many others, such as the shipyard
                workers, the aircraft and other factory workers, will have to
                plod on. Indeed, many children still have to go to school.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have spent many years working in industry,
                and I always felt it an injustice to have to clock in on
                St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day when others were on holiday. In this era
                of equality all people should be given the same opportunities
                and privileges. We discussed equality issues this morning. Now
                is the time to show our sincerity and treat everyone in the same
                way. To do otherwise would be barefaced hypocrisy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are other reasons for St&nbsp;Patrick’s
                Day’s being made a public holiday. St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day
                unites all sides of the community in Northern Ireland. We should
                cherish and promote this in what is otherwise a deeply divided
                society. The Good Friday Agreement seems to be built on a vision
                of two separate but equal communities working together with
                mutual respect. This is not a vision that is shared by us; nor
                is it sufficient for Alliance. Not only does it ignore the much
                greater pluralism that exists; it does not encourage the
                emergence of common bonds and loyalties among our people —
                something that should concern not just the liberally minded but
                everyone. Unless the things that unite us begin to dominate
                those that divide us, it will be too easy for society to be torn
                apart at some time in the future by those who thrive on
                suspicion and mistrust.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To counter this danger we need to develop a
                stronger sense of common regional identity. This should draw
                upon, reflect and respect the diversity of cultural traditions
                right across society. It cannot and must not be based
                exclusively on one or other of the two main political and
                religious sections. Promotion of what the people of Northern
                Ireland hold in common is something that the Secretary of State
                himself touched upon in a speech that he made to the Institute
                of Irish Studies in Liverpool last Friday. He said that he
                wanted to see a Northern Ireland with two self-assured
                traditions but one body of citizens united by</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;shared language, shared values and
                shared land with bonds that are strong enough to encompass
                diversity of religion, of politics and of custom.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He cautioned against outsiders trying to
                impose this but recognised that within the institutional
                framework of the Good Friday Agreement the people of Northern
                Ireland, and their representatives, can help to shape the
                values, identities and symbols of our society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can now do this by speaking with one
                voice. A call from the Assembly to make St Patrick’s Day a
                public holiday could be an important first step towards trying
                to recognise and enlarge our common bonds. However, we must
                recognise that not every citizen in Northern Ireland or the
                Republic of Ireland is of Christian origin. As far as I am
                aware, St&nbsp;Patrick was neither a Unionist nor a Nationalist,
                nor was he a card-carrying member of the Alliance Party, the
                Women’s Coalition or any other party, North or South.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All people in Northern Ireland, Unionist and
                Nationalist and those of us from the centre, should be able to
                associate with St&nbsp;Patrick, in comfort. It should be open to
                those from all religious backgrounds — Christian,
                non-Christian — and none.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This motion gives the Assembly an opportunity
                to send an important message asking that St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day
                be made a public holiday, and I commend it to the House.</p>

                the Christian heritage of the people of Ireland. It does not
                matter that that Christian heritage diversified and has
                different connotations today — it had a common origin in the
                preachings of St Patrick and his disciples. Indeed,
                non-Christians in our community have very high regard for that
                tradition and would not oppose the celebration of
                St&nbsp;Patrick in any way, if only because on his day,
                throughout the world, Irishmen, from North or South, commemorate
                together their origins in the island of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I always find it sad to look across the
                Atlantic and see the enormity of the celebrations there, and the
                exodus from this island to America. We should be celebrating the
                day here ourselves in harmony and comradeship.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Irish diaspora, which is not often
                mentioned but is very much Patrician, is that which spread from
                this island, and particularly from the North — Down, Antrim
                and Armagh — through western and eastern Europe to the
                Dalmatian coastline of the Adriatic. People from here founded
                monasteries, towns and all sorts of institutions, and that has
                never been tapped.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we want to be commercial about it, we
                could harness that enormous link with people around the world.
                The people of Ireland have touched not only the 40&nbsp;million
                people in America but huge numbers of people in Western Europe,
                the Middle East, the Far East and Australia. They would be only
                too happy to celebrate that wonderful day with us if we got our
                house in order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe I heard the melodious voice of
                Sammy&nbsp;Wilson on the radio this morning saying that he
                intended to oppose the motion. I am not sure if I interpreted
                him correctly, but it puzzled me somewhat because I remember my
                esteemed parliamentary Colleague, the leader of the DUP, asking
                in the House of Commons some years ago that St Patrick’s Day
                be made a public holiday. I support him entirely in that. This
                should not be a party issue; it should be a matter of us all
                getting together to celebrate the day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would hate to think that this debate might
                later involve divisive issues. That is not the intention of the
                motion. The intention is to create something that we can
                celebrate together without confrontation, a national day that we
                can invite people from all continents to join with us in
                celebrating.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rome gained entrance into Ireland in the
                eleventh century, 600 years after Patrick. When the Danes who
                had settled in Ireland became Christians they refused to
                acknowledge the authority and jurisdiction of Patrick’s Church
                and sent their bishops to be consecrated as Roman Catholic
                bishops.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rome gained hold of the whole of Ireland
                because in 1155 Pope Adrian IV, the only Englishman who was ever
                Pope — and look what he did to you people — gave Henry II of
                England permission to conquer Ireland to enlarge the bounds of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When he proposed the motion Mr&nbsp;McCarthy
                did not tell us about the sectarianisation and politicisation of
                Patrick. If you go to New York you will see the great parade he
                refers to. Is there anyone in that parade who would give one
                cent to a Unionist, or to a person wanting to maintain the
                Constitution? The Member knows there is not. St&nbsp;Patrick has
                had a Hibernian suit and sash and an IRA suit put on him. An IRA
                man, well known for his terrorist activities, has led that
                parade. If that is not making political capital out of a certain

                He brought the Bible gospel. In his works — the Confession,

                have major difficulty with the part of the motion calling for
                St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day to be made a public holiday that is
                dependent on the imprimatur of the Queen or the British
                Government. The Alliance Party was at pains to point out that
                the wording of the motion was completely out of its control.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the spirit of the motion that
                St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day should be for all Irish people. It
                should be for those people born on the island of Ireland who
                identify themselves variously as Scots, Scots-Irish, British,
                Chinese, Asian or of any other ethnic group, who, like those

                history of Ireland. At the end of the day we sang the National
                Anthem, and then we went home to the usual harassment by
                militiamen on overtime at roadblocks&quot;.</p>

                the feast day of St&nbsp;Patrick half a million people from all
                over the world participated in the parade in Dublin, watched by
                a further quarter of a million.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tourist industry in the South,
                recognising the potential of cultural celebration, made
                St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day a celebration for the Irish economy, so
                increasing its share of the gross national product to 7%. The
                North’s tourism lags behind at a mere 2%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As well as in Dublin, St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day
                is celebrated all over the world, from Sydney to New&nbsp;York,
                from Washington to Paris — the list could go on. Indeed, in
                recent years we have seen many Members jetting off to the United
                States to join in the St Patrick’s Day celebrations there. If
                we were to make St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day a public holiday here we
                could give Washington a miss and kick off our tourist season at
                home by funding and extending the celebrations — in
                particular, those denied to people in Belfast and Derry. Over
                the years, Unionism has made successive attempts to deny
                Nationalist people the right to their cultural identity and the
                right to uphold that identity by celebrating St&nbsp;Patrick’s
                Day as a public holiday, but it has only postponed the day of
                reckoning against the bleak cultural monolith of Six-County
                Unionism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we have seen in the amazing St Patrick’s
                Day parades in Belfast over the last few years is what we know
                from our history. One can strip a people of everything except
                their culture. They will still have enough culture buried deep
                in their psyche and in their imagination and enough skill to
                bring tens of thousands of people on to the streets of Belfast
                to celebrate their diversity, their talent, their imagination
                and their love of the country which gave them birth. If nothing
                else, the success of the St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day carnival in
                Belfast, despite Belfast City Council’s refusal to fund it,
                should indicate the support in the community for its being
                declared a public holiday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What a surprise it must have been to the
                narrow-minded begrudgers that a few tricolours should appear at
                the St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day parade in Belfast, or that people
                should resort to wearing green. Sure it happens all over the
                world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to congratulate the organisers of the
                St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day carnival in Belfast. Their efforts
                during recent years have paved the way for this motion. In line
                with the South, St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day should indeed be a
                public holiday. There are many reasons for this, not least of
                which is that Nationalists will no longer accept being told how
                or what they should do to celebrate their identity.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In normal circumstances the subject of how St
                Patrick’s Day could best be commemorated, given the saint’s
                legacy, would be an extremely appropriate matter for the House
                to consider. Patrick was indeed a saint in the true biblical
                sense. He was a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ and dependent
                upon Him for his salvation. That is beyond dispute. I am sure
                that St&nbsp;Patrick would be absolutely aghast if he were here
                to witness how people currently celebrate his time in this land
                — with green beer and pagan parades. That has nothing to do
                with what Patrick believed or how he would have liked to be
                remembered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, this debate seems most inappropriate
                when we consider that last week the Ulster Unionist Party

                to debate the most important issue facing this community, one
                which requires urgent attention: decommissioning and how to
                remove terrorists and their guns from the democratic process.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will indeed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I simply make the point that St&nbsp;Patrick
                did not have a flag. Regardless of what colour people are trying
                to attribute to St&nbsp;Patrick, or what flag, be it the
                tricolour or the Union flag, people here would like to associate
                him with, he did not have a flag. Those who attempt to
                politicise Patrick or attribute colours of any hue to him do him
                and his message a grave disservice. Patrick came to know his
                Saviour under the banner of the cross. That is the only standard
                behind which he rallied, and that is what he would wish all in
                this community, whether Catholic, Protestant, Unionist or
                Nationalist, to do also.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland take
                their first tentative steps on a new road to a pluralist society
                and endeavour to come to terms with the divisions which have
                been created, rightly or wrongly, over the last few&nbsp;hundred
                years of their history, it is indeed timely to remind them that
                they have another, more ancient, legacy — a shared historical
                and cultural inheritance of which most of them are largely
                unaware. This is embodied in the figure, mythological or real,
                of St&nbsp;Patrick — Patricius, the &quot;gentleman&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among the oldest named population groups of
                Ireland were the Cruthin, an ancient British people dominant in
                large parts of old Ulster. Their most powerful dynasty was the
                Dal&nbsp;nAraidi whose territory became known as Dalaradia.
                According to legend, Patrick was first brought to Ireland as a
                slave from Romanised Britain and sold to a Cruthin chieftain
                called Milchu, a petty king who ruled over part of Dalaradia
                near Mount Slemish in present day County&nbsp;Antrim. It was
                later, at Kells and Connor rather than Downpatrick and Armagh,
                that the cult of Patrick developed in its present form. The
                story of Christian&nbsp;Dalaradia is not confined to its
                religious or political aspects but, indeed, embraces a quite
                remarkable literary tradition. Proinias&nbsp;MacCana, who was
                reared in the Falls&nbsp;Road area of Belfast and is our finest
                living Gaelic scholar, summed up this rich cultural legacy of
                Ulster when he wrote</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In Ireland the seventh century is
                marked by two closely related developments: the rapid extension
                of the use of writing in the Irish language and an extraordinary
                quickening of intellectual and artistic activity, which was to
                continue far beyond the limit of the centuries.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The immediate sources of this artistic
                renewal were the scriptoria of certain of the more progressive
                monasteries and their direct agents, those monastic literati,
                whom the Irish metrical tracts refer to by the very significant
                title &quot;Nualitride&quot; — the &quot;new men of
                letters&quot;. While there is no reason to suppose that these
                individuals were confined to any one part of Ireland, the
                evidence strongly suggests that it was only in the east, or more
                precisely in the south-east, of Ulster that their activities
                assumed something of the impetus and cohesiveness of a true
                cultural movement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this land of Ulster, conservation and
                creativity went hand in hand. In Ireland the relatively new
                skill of writing in the vernacular began to be vigorously
                exploited, not only for the direct recording of secular oral
                traditions — heroic, mythological and the more strictly
                didactic — but also as a vehicle for the imaginative
                recreation of certain sections of that Irish tradition. One may,
                with due reservations, speak of this region of south-east
                Ulster, where Members are presently sitting, as the cradle of
                written Irish literature. It was in Bangor in County&nbsp;Down
                that there seems to have been an intellectual centre whence the
                cultural dynamic of the east Ulster region emanated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr&nbsp;McGrady said, Dalaradia’s legacy
                and Ulster’s legacy was not confined to these shores. Not only
                was there a highly productive relationship with nearby Scotland,
                but when Columbanus set forth from Bangor on his great
                missionary travels he was embarking on a journey which was to
                have profound significance for the rebirth of European
                civilisation following the collapse of the Roman&nbsp;Empire.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most importantly, however, the story of
                Dalaradia and of that British slave who is credited with
                founding Christianity within it offers us hope that the people
                of present-day Northern&nbsp;Ireland may one day cease to view
                their different aspirations of Britishness and Irishness as a
                constant source of conflict and division —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Congratulations on your new office,
                Mr&nbsp;Deputy&nbsp;Speaker.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sympathise with Dr&nbsp;Paisley’s remarks
                about how some people have sought to sectarianise the
                celebration of the cultural and religious inheritance of
                St&nbsp;Patrick for political ends. On occasions, the
                celebration of St&nbsp;Patrick’s&nbsp;Day has been a
                chauvinistic exercise, which any democratic person who is
                sincerely patriotic would condemn. Those of us who admire
                St&nbsp;Patrick wish to see St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day used to
                celebrate the diversity of Irishness rather than the narrow
                identification of Irishness which some would like to impose upon
                us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have said, I sympathise with
                Dr&nbsp;Paisley, but, of course, he overreacts. St&nbsp;Patrick’s&nbsp;Day
                is a celebration that we can all enjoy and involve ourselves in.
                Thanks to St Patrick, this island has traditionally been called
                the land of saints and scholars referring to its being an island
                of spirituality and learning. We should try to rediscover those
                things, and in that way St&nbsp;Patrick could once again be a
                unifying rather than a divisive figure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened to Sammy&nbsp;Wilson this morning
                on the radio. He is opposed to this motion, and one of his
                arguments is that he is not Irish. How absurd. When
                Mr&nbsp;Wilson was Lord&nbsp;Mayor of Belfast he wore the chain
                of office that was presented to the city in 1874. That chain, as
                Dr&nbsp;Adamson will confirm, has a Celtic design with
                representations of the four&nbsp;provinces of Ireland. It is
                inscribed &quot;Erin go bragh&quot;, meaning &quot;Ireland for
                ever&quot;. The chain was presented by the Protestant and
                Unionist councillors and aldermen of the Corporation of Belfast
                because they regarded themselves very much as Irishmen. They
                regarded themselves as Unionists but as Irish Unionists. Being a
                Unionist does not mean that one is not Irish or that one should
                deny one’s Irishness. People should celebrate their Irishness.
                To deny the political connotations is fair enough, but do not
                deny that cultural inheritance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot support the amendment. The Good
                Friday Agreement says about flags and emblems</p>

                sensitivity of the use of symbols and emblems for public
                purposes, and the need in particular in creating the new
                institutions to ensure that such symbols and emblems are used in
                a manner which promotes mutual respect rather than
                division.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, any flag, whether it be the
                Union&nbsp;Jack or the tricolour, creates divisions in this
                society. That is the unfortunate reality. We must move beyond
                that to a situation in which we either respect both flags on an
                equal footing or we create new symbols to unite the entire
                community —</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I&nbsp;have listened to some of the
                contributions with interest. I&nbsp;support the amendment,
                particularly as Members are talking about a person who came from
                the mainland and who, on his return, brought Christianity to
                this island. I mentioned in an earlier debate how we, at
                Christmas, had not acknowledged our Lord’s birthday. We were
                celebrating the second millennium but could not raise our flag
                in its recognition. That was despicable and irresponsible. The
                First Minister and the Deputy First&nbsp;Minister abandoned
                their responsibilities. They should have ensured that the flag
                was flown. The First&nbsp;Minister pointed out that the flying
                of the flag is a matter of royal prerogative. For that reason,
                the flag should have been flown.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is another occasion on which a unique
                personality should be celebrated. As Mr&nbsp;Alban Maginness
                quite rightly said, a contribution was made, not just in these
                islands, but to the whole of Western Europe through the movement
                that St&nbsp;Patrick set up. He brought Christianity to the
                Celts. Those people who are members of the Church of Ireland or,
                indeed, Presbyterians will have sung ‘St&nbsp;Patrick’s
                Breastplate’. It is almost a confession of their faith — a
                confession that is shared by all of the reformed faith. We
                should, therefore, unhesitatingly give our support to this
                remarkable person. He established a culture of scholarliness
                which, in later centuries, the Roman&nbsp;Catholic system, when
                imposed, did everything in its power to eradicate. Early
                Christian writings are rare and extremely difficult to find. The
                early contributions of many of these people are perhaps the
                rarest and most important relics of that age.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr&nbsp;Adamson referred to St&nbsp;Columbanus,
                who was a product of the university set up in those days. The
                Black Death was probably the greatest contributing factor to
                moving our saints on crusades to evangelise the rest of the
                British&nbsp;Isles and the greater part of Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, while recognising St&nbsp;Patrick
                and acknowledging the great part that he played in our history,
                in shaping a land of saints and scholars, we know that much has
                been eradicated and that standards have been lowered. Who can
                honestly associate green beer with a Christian saint? And I have
                no more time for a person drinking orange beer underneath an
                Orange banner than for someone on green beer underneath a green
                banner. They are lowering the standards set by the good saint
                who brought us Christianity.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask some Members to my right not to carry
                on private conversations when others are trying to speak.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs E Bell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. We all have
                different ideas of equality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day should not be
                hijacked by any one group, church or tradition. Many of us
                personally identify with St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day. I remember as
                a child putting on shamrock to commemorate our patron saint. In
                later years, I remember celebrating St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day with
                many of our voluntary organisations and peace groups in the
                Church of Ireland’s Down Cathedral in Downpatrick and then
                watching the parade pass through the town. It was a wonderful
                feeling, and I wish that it could be repeated in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also remember St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day was a
                cross-community celebration. At the ceremonies in Downpatrick
                and elsewhere we all came together — believers and
                non-believers from different background and traditions — to
                remember the man who came to unite all the people in a spirit of
                goodwill and tolerance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">St Patrick’s Day should not be used as a
                tool to divide us. This would fly in the face of the Christian
                message that St&nbsp;Patrick sought to promote. That is why it
                is wrong for some sections of the community to try to associate
                St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day with narrow or sectional political
                causes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parades should be inclusive and
                representative of the various groups and organisations in the
                towns and cities in which they take place. That is why the
                Alliance&nbsp;Party had considerable difficulties with the
                proposed parade for Belfast, although it supports the concept of
                the Belfast parade in principle. All sections of the community
                recognise the important contribution made by St&nbsp;Patrick to
                Christianity in Ireland, and that view has been echoed today by
                other Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is somewhat unfortunate that Protestants,
                unlike Catholics, have felt inhibited about celebrating
                St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day. Catholics have never tried to hijack
                St&nbsp;Patrick. He is not a Catholic St&nbsp;Patrick — he is
                St&nbsp;Patrick.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that in supporting the motion on a
                cross-community basis we can send a firm message that
                St&nbsp;Patrick should be for everybody. The case for making
                St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day a public holiday is a strong one.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, it would enable everybody to have the
                day off work and school and take part in the various events
                being held around the country. Secondly, it would enable people
                to celebrate St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day with the same vigour and
                enthusiasm with which it is celebrated in other parts of the
                world. Surely it is strange that St&nbsp;Patrick is commemorated
                more abroad than in parts of his own land? Thirdly, it would
                enable the Government to declare a public holiday for which
                there is considerable cross-community support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is vital that we, as an Assembly and a
                Government, take this opportunity to promote what this community
                holds in common to counter what divides us all, and
                St&nbsp;Patrick can really be for all of us. Therefore,
                Mr&nbsp;Deputy&nbsp;Speaker, I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and the amendment. Why?
                Basically because, if passed, the amended motion would encourage
                the Government to act more consistently in their treatment of
                people in Northern&nbsp;Ireland and would enable greater
                consistency between Northern&nbsp;Ireland and the rest of the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of consistency within
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, a substantial percentage of employees
                currently gets St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day as a holiday, but not
                everybody does. In terms of consistency within the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom, as my Colleague Mr&nbsp;Wilson has already
                pointed out, it is the case that St&nbsp;Andrew’s Day in
                Edinburgh and St&nbsp;David’s Day in Cardiff are already
                so-called national flag days when the Union flag of the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom is flown. Also, if a public building has a
                second flagpole, the flag of the appropriate country or
                principality — in our case, Province — is also flown.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a Unionist, I do not regard the
                remembrance of St&nbsp;Patrick with any particular discomfort,
                though I do share the reservations that some people on this side
                of the House have expressed about the way in which
                St&nbsp;Patrick has been remembered in certain quarters over the
                years. At one time I would have approached the question of the
                celebration of St&nbsp;Patrick with some degree of agnosticism.
                At one point I would have agreed with those commentators who
                doubted if he existed at all. But I have moved beyond that
                point, and I now see that he may well be buried in at least two
                places — a formidable achievement!</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As someone who was born in
                Great&nbsp;Britain, I also note with some amusement that Patrick
                may have been a native of the Bristol area, or south&nbsp;Wales,
                or the Scottish shore area of Solway Firth. Dr&nbsp;Adamson,
                Mr&nbsp;Alban&nbsp;Maginness and other Members have pointed out
                St&nbsp;Patrick’s contribution to wider European history.
                Indeed, the notable historian Norman&nbsp;Davies, in his recent
                ‘Europe A History’, writes of St&nbsp;Patrick’s life’s
                work</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In this way Ireland had been secured
                for Christianity before the blanket of Anglo-Saxon heathenism
                fell over the rest of the British&nbsp;Isles. The Irish would
                repay their debt.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a sense Mr&nbsp;Gibson has anticipated me,
                for if it is indeed true that Patrick banished the snakes from
                Ireland, then a modern application does perhaps suggest itself
                as we consider some of the wider political issues facing us this
                week.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me summarise the reasons for having a
                public holiday to commemorate St&nbsp;Patrick. As has been
                pointed out by a number of Members, he was a Christian saint who
                pre-dated our Protestant and Catholic traditions, and in his
                life he expressed both the tragedy and triumph of relations
                between the two islands of Britain and Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For these reasons I support the motion and
                the amendment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, may I express some regret about the
                comments made by my Colleague Mary&nbsp;Nelis, who referred to
                the bleak cultural monolith of Six-County Unionism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While there are cultural monoliths in the
                North, they are not exclusive to Unionism, and Members on this
                side of the House should recognise that cultural monoliths, and
                their bleakness, have been common to both of our traditions in
                the past — and they are not exclusive to one tradition now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The comment was also inappropriate given that
                in the Chamber today we are going to have an example not of
                bleak cultural monoliths but of inclusive cultural thinking. It
                was inappropriate for that sort of comment to be made, on this
                day of all days. I recognise that Barry&nbsp;McElduff
                acknowledged the comments made by Ian&nbsp;Adamson. He is not an
                advocate of bleak cultural monolithism, and that was reflected
                in his speech.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, the SDLP will not support the
                amendment moved by the Ulster Unionist Party. However, it is
                important to acknowledge the reason for that. There is quite a
                degree of cohesion and agreement about St&nbsp;Patrick and what
                he represents in terms of culture, community and religion, and
                that has been reflected in the debate and in the wider
                community. This differentiates the issue of St&nbsp;Patrick from
                the issue of flags, and it was inappropriate, and unnecessary,
                to parachute into this debate something that was bound to cause
                a degree of division. For those reasons, as well as for those
                outlined by my Colleague Alban&nbsp;Maginness, we will not be
                inclined to support the amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, some comments made in this debate
                are a signpost to how we should conduct ourselves here and in
                the wider community in future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Nationalist people, of whom I am one,
                have to recognise that their identity is in a process of
                evolution because of our political and constitutional agreement.
                What it is to be Irish — and that includes our wish to share
                in the life of the island — is different now from what it was
                before. As Nationalists we have to recognise that we are being
                influenced by the various diaspora around the world and by our
                wider European identity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nationalists must also acknowledge that our
                sister island influences our identity and what it means to be
                Irish in the new millennium. While we are not sure what those
                influences mean for us, and we are not sure about how our
                identity will change because of them, there are influences upon
                our values, our culture and our way of life which have redefined
                us as Irish people in this part of the island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This means that there are influences from the
                British island on our identity and on how we perceive ourselves
                that we, as people of this island, are going to have to
                acknowledge more fully. As we begin to acknowledge this, we must
                also acknowledge that there are people in this Chamber, and in
                the wider community, who are beginning slowly and painfully to
                acknowledge other influences upon their identity, influences
                from the whole island, which are going to mean for them a period
                of growth and development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, if we do not sign up to a wider
                celebration of St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day and all that that means,
                in narrow terms, we will be letting all the community down.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day, more than any other
                day, is the day on which this island is in the eye of the world.
                The world identifies with it and shares in it. This is not just
                a religious event. Religion is in decline, and that is a matter
                of regret. This is the day on which the world can see our
                economic opportunity, our commercial initiative and the wider
                opportunities that are there for the people of this island to
                enjoy if we grasp them. By developing our notion of what it is
                to be Irish and by sharing in the concept of St&nbsp;Patrick’s
                Day, whatever that means to us, we can create opportunities for
                all the people of this island for the future.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the amendment to the motion, and I
                want to make my reasons clear. Any proposal before the Assembly
                to encourage the United&nbsp;Kingdom Government to permit the
                flag to fly over this part of the United&nbsp;Kingdom,
                especially at a time when we are being stripped of our British
                identity, will always have my support. I will not be supporting
                the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Mr&nbsp;McCarthy was proposing the
                motion, he apologised for its wording. I thought that he was
                apologising for his grammatical contortions, but he was doing
                what the Alliance&nbsp;Party does best: crawling to
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin. I am sorry that we have to appeal to Her
                Majesty’s Government. I know that this may be offensive to
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin, but, unfortunately, this is the way in which it
                has to be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion itself does not make sense. If one
                reads the couple of contributions that Mr&nbsp;McCarthy has made
                in the Assembly one will see that he is the master of
                grammatical contortion. When the Hansard staff get to work on
                his two speeches they will be unable to get rid of his split
                infinitives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to refer to points already made. In
                one sentence Mr&nbsp;McCarthy paid lip-service to the fact that
                St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day has something to do with a religious
                figure. He said that St&nbsp;Patrick had a role in bringing
                Christianity to Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the rest of his five or 10 minutes he
                dealt with other reasons, the non-religious aspects of
                St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day, and they were well explained by
                himself, the SDLP and Sinn&nbsp;Féin. They all centre around
                the celebration of Ireland’s national day, our national day,
                the day on which Irish people express their culture. Alban&nbsp;Maginness
                has, in his arrogance, tried to tell me that it is absurd to say
                that I am not Irish. I am not Irish, and all the arrogance and
                all the contorted logic of Alban&nbsp;Maginness will not make me
                Irish. I do not wish to celebrate Ireland’s national day. I do
                not wish to celebrate the day on which Irish people celebrate
                their culture. I am British, and proud of it. Wearing a chain
                with &quot;Erin go bragh&quot; round my neck did not make me
                Irish.</p>

                I have always been of the opinion that St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day
                should be celebrated and should be a public holiday. I support
                the amendment because the motion does not go far enough. Some
                mention has been made of the chain which I also wore as
                Lord&nbsp;Mayor of Belfast. During that time I attempted to have
                the Lord&nbsp;Mayor’s parade brought forward to
                St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day. Unfortunately, I was unsuccessful. Had
                I been successful, we might not have had the sectarianism in the
                Belfast parade last year that will probably be present this
                year. Mrs&nbsp;Nelis mentioned funding. I walk on 12&nbsp;July
                in the biggest parade of all, and I do not have any funding. I
                have to pay my dues before I am allowed to walk, so I do not see
                why anybody needs funding for a parade.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been much talk about Irish and
                British. I am both Irish and British. I believe that anyone who
                is born on the island of Ireland is Irish and that anyone who is
                born in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, a part of the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom, is British. I belong to the Church of
                Ireland, which is founded on the principles of St&nbsp;Patrick.
                I also belong to the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland and am very
                proud of that. It is wrong for Members and Friends opposite to
                lecture us on what it means to be Irish. I do not need any such
                lectures. I know what I am, and I have always shown it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The dispute about what an Irishman actually
                is has been going on for a long time. One English dictionary
                described an Irishman as a hunter, and another as a moorsman. I
                think it was the poet Patrick&nbsp;Kavanagh who described an
                Irishman as a sophisticated mechanism for turning Guinness into
                urine. Those who are Murphy’s drinkers, like me, will find
                that it is a superfluous exercise anyway.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1921 the first Prime Minister of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland said that Ulstermen were Irishmen, the
                best Irishmen — aye, the very best. I agree.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no problem with the motion in
                principle, but it does not go far enough. If you have a public
                holiday here you fly the Union flag. Wales, Scotland and England
                have public holidays commemorating their saints, and the Union
                flag is flown. Since we are part of the United&nbsp;Kingdom it
                should be no different here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Lord&nbsp;Mayor of Dublin was in
                Belfast with his chain of office, which carries a motif of
                King&nbsp;William of Orange, I offered to swap, but he would not
                agree.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the amendment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day’s
                becoming a holiday has been well examined by Members in an
                erudite way and in other ways. I can but add one or two comments
                about the importance of St&nbsp;Patrick to Ireland in another
                sense — and I make no apologies for saying this.
                St&nbsp;Patrick has international appeal and recognition. It was
                John&nbsp;F&nbsp;Kennedy, I think, who said that there were some
                47&nbsp;million people of Irish descent or who would claim Irish
                connection. President&nbsp;Reagan pitched it at 70&nbsp;million.
                Whatever it is, there is an enormous potential for tourism, and
                I am talking about using the patron saint’s day and the image
                of St&nbsp;Patrick to attract tourists. We have been working on
                this in Downpatrick in a number of ways. We are very proud of
                what we have achieved so far and are optimistic about the
                future. This is something that we should not forget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Downpatrick’s St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day
                parades have been very successful. The reason for that — other
                Members have noted this — is that no national flags of any
                kind have been flown. We asked people not to bring them, and 99%
                did not. The council provides St&nbsp;Patrick’s flags, and
                that has been successful because it has been seen as neutral:
                people participate without any fear of being in awe of any one
                side.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is why, as my Colleagues have explained,
                we cannot support the amendment. I have no doubt that there were
                good intentions behind the amendment, but it has escaped the
                notice of those who proposed it that of all things in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland flags are perhaps the most divisive. That
                is because of the way in which they are used.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Flags originated with Roman standard-bearers.
                A bearer in the legion held the standard against all odds, and
                the legion would defend the standard-bearer to the very last
                person. The image of the standard-bearer was carried forward by
                the Normans with flags that we know and see today and by
                Governments into nation states. In the last and previous
                centuries, regiments fought with their colours and defended them
                to the last man if necessary. They honoured and respected their
                flags and gave them their allegiance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What happens in Northern&nbsp;Ireland? Flags
                are an in-your-face political taunt for both sides.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a primeval urge which reminds me of
                wild dogs urinating to mark their territory, and that is the
                image of flags on both sides. When you drive around
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland you see the tatters on the masts and
                flagpoles. Who has any respect or honour for his flag when he
                allows that to happen to it? Those flags are a political taunt.
                That is why we cannot support the amendment to the motion. The
                motion is a good and sound one which has my full support, but
                the amendment is divisive by its very nature.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am unable to support the motion, but I
                support the amendment. At the moment St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day is
                a bank holiday but not a public holiday, and there are many who
                want to see it become a public holiday which they can enjoy. I
                do not have any difficulty with that. If that is their wish they
                should be granted it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Patrick’s theology and religious practices
                have come up quite often in the debate. There are relevant in
                that they are often overlooked on the streets of New&nbsp;York,
                Washington and elsewhere, where St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day seems to
                be a bigger day than it is on the island of Ireland. However,
                Patrick’s theology and religious practices are not an issue.
                The issue is whether Patrick remains the patron saint of the
                Republic of Ireland. If he does, how can British citizens feel
                part of the celebration?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The comments by Mr&nbsp;Maginness, the Member
                for North&nbsp;Belfast, almost beggar belief. If we are not part
                of an ethos or an identity, whatever is done to attempt to widen
                that identity does not matter, because we are still simply not
                part of it. It is like asking the people who live alongside the
                Great&nbsp;Lakes or on the borders of Canada if they want to be
                part of the 4<sup>th</sup> of July. They would say &quot;Why on
                earth should we? We are not Americans.&quot; And if someone
                pointed out that they lived in North&nbsp;America they would
                reply &quot;Yes, but we are Canadians.&quot; It is the same in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. We may be Irish because we live on the
                island of Ireland, but we are British by birth and will remain
                so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can Bastille Day be celebrated in Spain? Why
                not? If those whose identity is not Irish can be expected to
                celebrate Irishness, why can we not expect the Spanish to
                celebrate Bastille Day? Is the modern St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day
                for everyone regardless of his religion? It should be for
                everyone who regards himself as Irish. I do not and never will,
                now or in the future, and my children, grandchildren and great
                grandchildren will not regard themselves as Irish either. We
                treat with contempt this attempt to widen Irishness to include
                Protestants and the thought that if the parade is made less
                contentious, perhaps the Protestants will join in. That is the
                issue. That is the nature of this agenda.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I close my remarks by referring to the last
                Member’s comments about flags. I endorse some of what he said,
                for there has been too much flag-waving and in-your-face
                triumphalism with flags. The Member does not seem to understand,
                however, that they hauled down the Union flag in his council
                area following precedents set by other local authorities who had
                done likewise. Unionists saw that as the exit sign. It was time
                to go. They were not wanted. They were not welcome. They should
                leave. That is what they did in Londonderry. That is what they
                did elsewhere along the border. Where the Union flag cannot fly,
                British citizens are not welcome. Until people realise and
                accept that, we will have grave difficulties.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Robert Coulter:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nearly everything that needed to be said has
                been said already. First, it strikes me as somewhat ironic that
                we are discussing the celebration of a &quot;Brit&quot; as the
                patron saint of Ireland. Given the oft-heard battle-cry of
                &quot;Brits out&quot;, this could pose a difficulty for certain
                people in the years ahead, when they may have to look for
                another patron saint for Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, as has been pointed out, we are
                formalising the flying of the Union flag. Since the removal of
                the irredentist claims in articles&nbsp;2 and 3 of the Republic
                of Ireland’s constitution, we feel that we are merely
                normalising this part of the United&nbsp;Kingdom in that regard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, and most importantly, having
                St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day as a national holiday would remind us of
                the true spirit of worship. To love the Lord our God with all
                our being and our neighbour as ourselves should be the principle
                which supersedes and influences every aspect of our lives,
                including politics. If the challenge of St&nbsp;Patrick and the
                message he had about our personal lives and our relationship
                with our God and our neighbours were to enhance the quality of
                our lives and our politics, it would be worth it. I support the
                amendment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened with interest as this debate
                unfolded. I listened particularly to the Member who moved the
                motion and observed with even greater interest how he failed to
                address certain questions when asked to do so. I look forward to
                his addressing those questions, particularly the one about the
                sectarian nature of St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day parades in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The parade from which he derives the greatest
                joy is the one in New&nbsp;York. Can anyone with half a head on
                his shoulders not wonder what planet these people came from,
                given the coat-trailing exercise carried out in the name of
                celebrating St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day, particularly in Belfast?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened to the rant from Mary&nbsp;Nelis.
                It was nothing more than a sectarian rant, but one would hardly
                expect anything else from that quarter. It seems to be that Lady’s
                hallmark. She boldly declared that St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day was
                for the Irish. Then she got succour, comfort and support from
                the pan-Nationalist front spearheaded by Mr&nbsp;Maginness. He
                said that we on this side of the House have an identity crisis
                and are not really British at all. We are simply Irishmen just
                as he is.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He has been told in clear and unambiguous
                terms that we are not Irish bigots like him. Members such as
                Mr&nbsp;Campbell have said that. In fact, we are British and
                proud of it. We have no apologies to make for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Mr&nbsp;Maginness is up to it, I will
                throw down the challenge to the SDLP today to separate itself
                from Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA and take a bold and courageous stand
                against that sectarian organisation. Mr&nbsp;Attwood confirmed
                that it would not be doing that, and Mr&nbsp;ONeill seemed to
                think that it was for him to reinforce that. As far as the SDLP
                is concerned, the sectarian nature of St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day
                will continue as boldly as ever.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;ONeill said that flags divide people.
                He is quite right — they do. They single people out. In the
                part of the world where I live they mark out territory. The flag
                of my country is taken down, and the flag of a foreign, hostile
                nation is raised. That is the encouragement that Unionists get
                along the border. Maybe Mr&nbsp;ONeill has never been there, but
                he should go and see it for himself. Of course, the council that
                he sits on wants to compound the matter and insult us even more.
                It took down the Union flag of the country that pays all the
                grants and gives all the comforts that Mr&nbsp;ONeill wants to
                enjoy. It had to be pulled down. This is how he says he can
                unite the people and bring them together. Where does he live
                anyway?</p>

                &quot;Brits out&quot; we are not talking about the people who
                inhabit this part of the island; we are talking about the
                institutions of British governance on this part of the island. I
                wonder if Billy&nbsp;Bell would think the flying of the Irish
                national flag alongside the Union&nbsp;Jack acceptable, as
                flying the Union flag alongside the Scottish flag is accepted in
                Scotland. I do not want to talk about the flag; it should not be
                dragged into this debate. It should not be relevant to an issue
                that is intended primarily to bring about consensus or even
                introduce ecumenism into the debate.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the amendment. As some Members have
                said, St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day could be an occasion for community
                participation and enjoyment if it were done properly.
                St&nbsp;Patrick is remembered in history as a saint, and many
                churches celebrate his bringing Christianity to Ireland. He also
                has pride of place on one of the Orange banners. The cross of
                St&nbsp;Patrick is paraded in Belfast every 12&nbsp;July by a
                religious organisation. This shows that it recognises the part
                played by St&nbsp;Patrick.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What do we see whenever a St&nbsp;Patrick’s
                Day parade takes place? We see the promotion of Nationalism. If
                St&nbsp;Patrick were here today to see the float representing
                prisoners’ organisations, would he see that as part of his
                Christianity? Would he see the flaunting of tricolours — and
                that is what happens — as promoting the religion that he
                brought here? Would he see the picking of marshals on the
                grounds of their Republican credentials or on account of their
                being ex-prisoners as Christian behaviour?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These parades are an organised attack on our
                British heritage. I would like to make it very clear that I am
                not Irish. I have no wish to be Irish. I am British by birth,
                British by persuasion and British by choice. That is the way I
                want to be. Some Members mentioned their children. I want my
                children and my grandchildren — if there are any, as I hope
                there will be — to have the same choice and the same freedom
                that I have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear from their comments today that
                some Members see the St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day parade as an
                opportunity not to bring the community together, or to recognise
                the bringing of Christianity to Ireland, but to promote a
                Nationalist ethos and Nationalist sentiments. By their promotion
                of the political ideals that they have espoused here today and
                on the parades which already take place, they have excluded
                people like me from participating or from even wanting to
                participate. If they were to take out the politics and the
                national aspirations and focus entirely on St&nbsp;Patrick’s
                Christianity, many more people could and would enjoy the
                occasion. The quicker they put the focus on Christianity rather
                than on Nationalist aspirations and Nationalist politics and on
                rubbing our noses in the dirt, the quicker they will have that
                participation.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion and the debate today have
                highlighted the unsatisfactory situation that the day on which
                we celebrate our national patron saint is only partially
                recognised as a public holiday. There have been some examples of
                that in the divisions between the public sector and the private
                sector and in the divisions between controlled and maintained
                schools. Sometimes it seems that Protestant schools only get the
                day off when they are playing in a Schools’ Cup final.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is why it is so important that
                St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day be made fully inclusive, a day which can
                involve every citizen. We do not need divisive debates — <i>[Interruption]</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">— any more than we need two parades in
                Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to apply some of the more positive
                examples that have been given during the debate, such as using
                the day to bring people together to celebrate their shared
                history. Mrs Bell and Mr ONeill gave the example of the
                Downpatrick parade. As Mr&nbsp;Kieran McCarthy said when he
                moved the motion, Patrick was neither a Unionist nor a
                Nationalist, nor was he a card-carrying member of the
                Alliance&nbsp;Party. Dr&nbsp;Birnie pointed out that Patrick was
                neither a Protestant nor a Catholic in the sense that we
                understand them these days. Rev&nbsp;Robert&nbsp;Coulter
                reminded us that Patrick was actually a Brit, born on the
                western shores of the adjacent island. For me, it does not
                really matter whether they were the shores of the Solway or the
                Severn, for he was an adopted Irishman.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He was indeed a blow-in, but to regard
                someone who has such a distinguished record and who brought
                Christianity to this island like that is fairly cheap.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was very interested in
                Dr&nbsp;Ian&nbsp;Adamson’s linking Patrick very specifically
                to a small area around Kells and Connor. Even though I live in
                the parish of Connor, it is totally irrelevant whether he herded
                sheep on Croagh Patrick or pigs on Slemish. Patrick was brought
                here as a slave. He came back bringing Christianity with him. He
                lived, he taught and he died here, and we need to find a way to
                celebrate properly all that he brought to us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is funny how, in a debate where people
                seemed to be united, quite a few divisive remarks were made.
                Without recalling the remarks of every Member who spoke, I thank
                those who gave a broad general welcome. They started with
                Mr&nbsp;McGrady, and then I lost track.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was interested in Dr&nbsp;Paisley’s
                comments. He made it clear that he supports the motion, and he
                respects the idea of honouring St&nbsp;Patrick. He complained
                about sectarianism and the politicisation of St&nbsp;Patrick’s
                memory, and that is entirely consistent with the motion. We do
                not want a divisive St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day. We want one in
                which the entire community can unite, because there are cultural
                reasons — whatever Mr&nbsp;Campbell and some other members of
                the DUP may think — for being united in this, regardless of
                feelings about national citizenship.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were other expressions of support which
                perhaps I should gloss over, as they seemed a little thin at
                times. The exchange between Mr&nbsp;Maginness and Mr&nbsp;Gibson
                on the difference between cultural and political Irishness and
                the roots of Celtic Christianity was fascinating.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that Mr McElduff managed to join in
                the debate without being heckled too much by the DUP is,
                perhaps, evidence of our have gone a stage further in the
                Assembly today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Bell made a very practical suggestion
                when, referring to his time as Lord&nbsp;Mayor of Belfast, he
                said that he had hoped that the Lord&nbsp;Mayor’s parade could
                be rescheduled to take place on St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day. The
                Assembly should suggest this to future Lord&nbsp;Mayors as one
                way of overcoming the divisions in Belfast on this issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had the usual knockabout comedy from
                Mr&nbsp;Sammy&nbsp;Wilson. I gather that he does not like
                Alliance&nbsp;Party grammar. I do not particularly like the
                contorted way in which we have to phrase motions and amendments
                either.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was fascinated by his session on the radio
                this morning. I gathered from the broadcast that he is concerned
                that people get drunk on St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day. He had barely
                finished speaking when my telephone rang and the lady on the
                other end of the line went on to inform me that she was a
                Protestant and that she had seen people drunk on the Twelfth. In
                fact, I have it on good authority that some people get so drunk
                on the Twelfth that they have to take the thirteenth off as
                well. This motion does not propose that 18&nbsp;March too be a
                holiday. <i>[Interruption]</i></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have news for the DUP: people get drunk at
                Christmas too. Do we now have to go out and tell people that
                Christmas is cancelled because people get drunk and misuse a
                Christian celebration? Perhaps Sammy&nbsp;Wilson will tell the
                children of Northern&nbsp;Ireland that Santa is not coming this
                year because adults get drunk.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment needs to be taken seriously.
                However, I believe that it is unnecessary because, as I
                understand it, St&nbsp;Patrick’s Day is already a flag day in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>

                is divisive. I wonder if Ulster Unionist Members watched the
                rugby match at Twickenham on Saturday when the English fans, who
                for so long have arrogated the Union flag to themselves, finally
                seemed to have discovered their third of it — they were waving
                the St&nbsp;George cross.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No. I am afraid that I am under a time limit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are looking at the issue of flags it is
                time that people stopped arrogating the Union flag to one
                section of society. We could perhaps take our third out of it
                and use St&nbsp;Patrick’s flag as a unifying force instead of
                the two national flags, which are divisive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also believe that Mr&nbsp;Wilson is wrong
                and that in Scotland the Union flag and the saltire are flown
                beside each other on the Scottish Parliament. In Cardiff, they
                even fly the European flag beside the Union flag and the Welsh
                dragon, so some of the remarks that were made about practice in
                other parts of the UK are inaccurate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to see a future in which we start to
                move away from divisions, from the &quot;them and us&quot;
                society that has been our lot for 30&nbsp;years. We have

                &quot;their&quot; clubs and &quot;our&quot; clubs. This motion
                at least gives us a chance to show that we want to get away from
                the idea of &quot;their&quot; holidays and &quot;our&quot;
                holidays. I urge the Member who moved the amendment to withdraw

                this building, but, sadly, not from Rathgael or
                Castle&nbsp;Buildings. Members will recall that on
                17&nbsp;January this House passed a resolution condemning the
                Health Minister’s refusal to grant permission to fly the
                national flag. Assurances were given — this is my point — by
