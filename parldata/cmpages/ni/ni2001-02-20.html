                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During a debate on a motion on arrangements
                for obtaining from the Civic Forum its views on social, economic
                and cultural matters, moved by the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister on 6 February, a point of order was raised by Mr
                Peter Robinson as to whether the First Minister had misled the
                House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Speaker asked Mr Robinson to make
                available to my office papers to which he had referred.
                Subsequently, on 12 February, the First Minister raised a
                further point of order in response to the allegations made by Mr
                Robinson, and I indicated that he should supply to me the papers
                which, he ventured, showed that he had not misled the Assembly.
                I undertook to study both sets of papers and provide a response.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received both sets of papers and have
                given the matter careful consideration. It appears that a
                meeting of some kind took place under the auspices of the Civic
                Forum on 20 December in the morning, which considered and,
                indeed, suggested an amendment to a motion on the relationship
                between the Assembly and the Forum. The management committee of
                the Forum, meeting that same afternoon, agreed that that motion
                — amended, as it seems, that morning — should go forward to
                the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear from Mr Robinson’s comments and
                the correspondence that he has provided that the burden of his
                argument is that the meeting on the morning of 20 December was
                not competent to make decisions for the Forum as a whole. It is
                also clear that he is judging the conduct of the Civic Forum’s
                business against the standards and procedures followed by this
                Assembly and other public bodies with which he is familiar.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From my reading of the papers, it would
                appear that the Civic Forum does not operate in quite that way.
                For example, in the minute of the meeting of the management
                committee held on 20 December at 2.15 pm it is recorded that it
                was agreed that a quorum of 50% should be applied to plenary
                sessions and that decisions should be made only when a quorum
                was present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Laying aside any other unusual features of
                this decision, it would seem that the management committee
                considered itself entitled to set down standing orders for the
                Civic Forum without reference to the body as a whole, or it
                could be that the minute is inaccurate or incomplete. If the
                former is the case, then a sub-group other than the plenary has
                much more substantial competence in respect of the body as a
                whole than would be customary. That could explain how the
                meeting of the morning of 20 December 2000, despite not being
                called a plenary, could speak for the Civic Forum as a whole.
                If, however, the minute is substantially inaccurate, and there
                is some evidence of inaccuracies in the documentation, it then
                becomes difficult to judge the question put to me on a perusal
                of the papers of the Forum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To summarise, the First Minister advised the
                Assembly that the Civic Forum had considered the terms of the
                motion and had amended it. It appears that both the management
                committee and another meeting of less certain composition did,
                indeed, consider and amend the proposed motion. The First
                Minister advised that the date of the meeting was 20 December
                2000. That also seems correct. From the evidence supplied to me
                by both Members, it appears that the procedures of the Forum’s
                meetings are different from the more formal arrangements that
                one would normally expect of a public body. I cannot see, on
                this basis, how one could rule that the First Minister had
                misled the House. Indeed, his actions were to the contrary.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Before the
                First Minister apologises to the Assembly, as is being requested
                by his Back-Benchers, have you looked at the e-mail from the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister of
                19&nbsp;December, which makes it clear that it is a meeting of a
                group? How can one explain away an e-mail that refers to the
                meeting as a group? If you are correct that the quorum for a
                meeting of the Civic Forum is 50% — 30 members — this
                meeting, by the admission of the First Minister and his
                colleagues, was one of 20 people. Therefore, it did not meet the
                quorum and could not speak on behalf of the Civic Forum.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So far as the question of the quorum is
                concerned, the decision, according to the minute, was arrived at
                subsequent to that meeting and would not refer back.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an old adage that as one lives, one
                judges one’s neighbours. Usually, that is meant in a rather
                negative sense. The Member has given a more positive meaning to
                this matter: he has an expectation that the Civic Forum will
                operate the kinds of procedures and standards with which he may
                be familiar here.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That applies to any public body.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That may be so. However, I have judged
                whether it would be appropriate for me, as Speaker, to enter
                into the question of how the Civic Forum conducts its business.
                I have taken the view that it would be improper for me to add to
                any confusion that may exist that this Assembly and its Speaker
                have any responsibility for, or any authority with regard to,
                the running of the Civic Forum.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Mr Trimble):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker.
                It is absolutely clear that the statements I made to the House
                were precisely accurate. Furthermore, it is clear, as you have
                said, that it is not proper for this House to sit in judgement
                of the Civic Forum and its procedures. It is also clear that if
                anyone has been misled, it is Mr Robinson.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been misled by Mr Trimble.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is Mr Robinson who has been misled by
                those who supplied him with partial information. I would have
                hoped that he would be capable of learning from his mistakes and
                have the decency to apologise for his quite improper behaviour.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I am not clear what the point of order
                is. If it is that it is not possible for this Assembly to raise
                questions about the Civic Forum, there may be a question as to
                whether the Forum, if it is to be an accountable body — and
                that is not wholly clear to me — is to be accountable to the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. If
                there is any question about issues being raised in the Assembly,
                the Committee of the Centre scrutinises the affairs of the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. That
                would be a proper place for the question of accountability of
                the Civic Forum to be raised and whether the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister has any accountablity. I
                am by no means sure, in these somewhat muddy waters, that that
                is necessarily the case.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Before the
                kindergarten tantrum of the First Minister, it was fairly clear
                that he does not consider the Committee of the Centre to be
                pertinent in this respect. The motion that he brought to the
                Assembly was not submitted to the Committee of the Centre. I
                assume from your ruling that you do not think that the Speaker
                is competent to answer questions about the propriety of the
                arrangements for the Civic Forum. However, is it not proper for
                the Speaker to indicate that they are shambolic? The Civic Forum
                has become nothing more than the lapdog of the First Minister,
                whose office is even responsible for putting out the notices of
                its meetings. What degree of independence can there be from a
                body that is in the pocket of the First Minister?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I have made it clear that I have no
                desire that there should be any confusion in the minds of
                Members or the public as to whether the Speaker has any
                authority in relation to, or bears any responsibility for, the
                procedures and standards of the Civic Forum. It is best for me
                to leave the ruling as I have made it. Other Members have made
                their comments, and we will leave them at that.</p>

                raise a matter that took place in the House on Tuesday 13
                February in my absence. It was referred to me yesterday when I
                came to the House. Mrs Nelis, in a statement, said</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;For example, I could talk about the
                thousands of Catholics who were forced to move south in 1969 as
                a result of pogroms by the RUC and the B-Specials. Some of them,
                for all we know, may be sitting in this Chamber. However, we do
                know that the founder of the DUP, Dr Paisley, was a prime mover
                in the lead-up to the pogroms in 1969 and certainly all pogroms
                since.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a very serious accusation — that I
                organised the persecution and massacre of Roman Catholics. I am
                very glad that these matters were looked into by a public, sworn
                inquiry — the Scarman inquiry. I have a copy of the report in
                my hand. Judge Scarman had this to say:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;[Dr Paisley] neither plotted nor
                organised the disorders under review, and there is no evidence
                that he was a party to any of the acts of violence investigated
                by us.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He also said that my role was no different
                from that of the political leaders on the other side of the
                sectarian divide. That gives the lie to the accusation that was
                thrown out in this House. However, I know that the Republicans
                do not want to see me in this House because on three occasions
                they attempted to kill me. When I was on the Albert Bridge with
                my son, they fired on the car in which I was travelling, and it
                was only by a miracle that the bullet did not penetrate the
                armoured vehicle. A group of gunmen also visited my church
                prayer meeting. Fortunately I was not —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind the House that if a Member intends
                to make remarks about a Colleague, it is normal to inform him.
                That is standard procedure in other Parliaments. It may be too
                much to expect Members here to advise individuals of such an
                intention, but it could be done through the Speaker’s Office.
                It is unfortunate if points are made about other Members,
                particularly in their absence without due warning having been
                given. I understand that such remarks are sometimes made in the
                heat of a debate, rather than during a planned speech, but it is
                generally best if we can proceed in an orderly fashion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I understand
                your point about the desirability of giving notice to an
                individual about whom one intends to make a personal reference
                — that is quite right. It may not, however, be desirable for
                you and your Office to interpose. It would be easier if notes to
                convey such information were posted on the notice board, and it
                would have been appropriate if that had been done in this case.</p>

                notes on a notice board would be the best way of dealing with

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker, though
                perhaps it could be said that I am seeking clarification. Since
                I am very often slammed and damned in my presence, and certainly
                in my absence, is it now perfectly legitimate for me to trawl
                through every Hansard and ask for a right of reply?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well, Mr Ervine is a merciful and gracious
                man. I trust that he will not take the opportunity to trawl
                through Hansard, however fascinating the Official Report of this
                House may be, so that he can respond in that way. However, he is
                correct in saying that he and other Members about whom
                allegations have been made in the House are entitled to request
                an opportunity to make a statement, as Dr Paisley did this
                morning and as other Members have done on other occasions.
                Despite what has been said, if a Member intends to make such
                references, it helps if he advises the Speaker’s Office in
                advance, as Dr Paisley quite properly did.</p>

                that Members who consider themselves to have been defamed have a
                right to reply. However, is it appropriate for a Member to
                quote, in his defence, from the report of a discredited British
                inquiry, such as the Scarman Report?</p>

                point of order. It is, of course, perfectly in order for a
                Member to quote, in his defence, anything he feels to be

                extent can Members expect the protection of the Speaker in these
                situations? An accusation was made against Dr Paisley to the
                effect that he had committed a criminal act and that he was
                responsible for the murder of individuals. On a previous
                occasion, when an accusation was made in the House by a Member
                from this side against members of the Provisional Sinn Féin/IRA
                movement, you ruled on the issue. In fact, you even put the
                Member out of the Chamber. To what extent should the Speaker,
                whoever it was at the time, have ruled against the comments made
                about Dr Paisley?</p>

                If it seems to me that it would be appropriate, in this case,
                for action to be taken, I will respond. If not, I shall simply

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That the Second Stage of the Budget Bill [NIA
                10/00] be agreed.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In moving this motion I wish to make some
                helpful points. The debate follows on from the Bill’s First
                Stage yesterday and the Supply motions for the 2000-01 spring
                Supplementary Estimates and the 2001-02 Vote on Account, which
                were also considered and approved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill has been given accelerated passage
                because of the change to Standing Order&nbsp;40 agreed on
                February&nbsp;12. That procedure was made conditional on
                confirmation from the Chairperson of the Finance and Personnel
                Committee that the Committee is satisfied that there has been
                appropriate consultation on the public expenditure proposals
                contained in the Bill. That condition has been met, and the
                confirmation was given in a letter dated February&nbsp;16 from
                the Chairperson of the Committee to the Speaker.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once again, I express my appreciation to the
                Finance and Personnel Committee for the attention that it has
                given and continues to give to matters of public expenditure and
                to related procedural issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of the Budget Bill is to give
                legislative effect to the resource estimates approved through
                the Supply resolutions passed yesterday. Given the wide-ranging
                and valuable debate, I do not intend to detain the House with
                unnecessary repetition of the detail implicit in the spending
                authorisation contained in the Bill. I gave much of that detail
                when I spoke yesterday. However, for the benefit of the Assembly
                I wish to summarise very briefly the main features of the Bill
                in accordance with the nature of the Second Stage debate
                envisaged under Standing Order&nbsp;30.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill authorises the issuing of
                £195,599,000 from the Northern Ireland Consolidated Fund in
                respect of the spring Supplementary Estimates for 2000-01 and
                appropriates this sum to specific services as set out in
                schedule&nbsp;1.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday, Members received copies of the
                detailed spring Supplementary Estimates booklet and the Vote on
                Account statement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Vote on Account provided for in the Bill
                for 2001-02 is to allow funds to continue to flow to public
                services for the early months of the incoming financial year
                until the Main Estimates can be presented to and considered by
                the Assembly. For the Vote on Account, the Budget Bill seeks the
                issue from the Consolidated Fund of the sum of £3806,414,000
                and its appropriation to services as in schedule&nbsp;2. In
                addition, it seeks the Assembly’s authorisation for the use of
                resources amounting to £4305,870,000 as set out in
                schedule&nbsp;3.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Sir John Gorman] in the
                Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concept of authorising resources is new
                and will be fully covered by amendments to the Government
                Resources and Accounts Bill, which will begin its Further
                Consideration Stage later today. The necessary elements are
                being put in place to ensure clear, unambiguous and firm control
                by the Assembly over the use of resources by Departments and
                public bodies when the change to full resource budgeting takes
                effect from 1 April this year. At the same time, it is important
                to ensure that expenditure and resource use authorised under
                separate statutory provision can proceed in addition to that,
                subject to the limit set in the Bill. That is the purpose of
                clause&nbsp;4(2).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The change to resource budgeting represents a
                milestone in the development of better management and
                information systems about the true costs and impact of policies,
                with the aim of promoting better design policies and improved
                value for money in the future. Resource budgeting is the basis
                upon which Northern Ireland and other devolved territories will
                be required to develop and support their bids for resources
                under the Barnett rules.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was most interested and, indeed, encouraged
                by the many views expressed by Members during yesterday’s
                useful debate. As I said yesterday, having had such a debate,
                there is little more that I can now add to the substance of the
                Budget Bill. I will, however, endeavour to respond to any points
                raised by Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As an Assembly, we are quickly coming to
                grips with our responsibilities to authorise and control public
                expenditure. The fact that we are doing so at a time of
                transition to a new accounting concept sets an additional
                challenge. However, this is a challenge that we gladly embrace,
                since the approval and control of resources epitomise the
                responsibilities we have accepted as public representatives.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In welcoming the Second Stage of the Budget
                Bill, it is worth repeating its historic nature. As has already
                been said, this is the first Budget by Northern Ireland people
                for Northern Ireland people in more than a quarter of a century.
                It is worth dwelling on the change that that represents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The allocations of money are not an end in
                themselves; they are a means to an end. What is significant are
                the services and results that they will buy. The Executive need
                to work in conjunction with the scrutiny Committees to prove
                that devolution makes a positive difference. We are witnessing
                the beginnings of such a positive difference with, for example,
                free public transport for the elderly and the projected enhanced
                student support. This Budget represents the beginnings of a
                collective achievement by the Executive. In order to achieve
                further good results — in other words to get good value for
                money — this Budget offers at least two novel features, namely
                the public service agreements and the Executive’s programme
                funds. These, of course, will be subjected to scrutiny both in
                Committee and in the House in the near future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A subject that seems to be of perennial
                interest in these debates, and that needs some enlightenment, is
                the regional rate and the principles of regional taxation. It
                seems that the level of business rates in Northern Ireland is
                broadly in line with that in Great Britain. My party is pleased
                that the Minister has been able to reduce the projected
                percentage increase in the business or commercial rate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anomalies remain in the ratings of individual
                business properties in various parts of the Province. For
                example, in Belfast there is evidence that properties on
                relatively depressed arterial routes carry the same rating
                burden as properties in prime locations in the city centre. That
                hardly seems equitable and should be the subject of speedy
                review. There is the linked issue of the base for commercial
                rates, which I will return to in a few minutes. I am glad that
                there is the prospect of a review of the ratings base. However,
                there are strong grounds for arguing that vacant properties
                should be subject to rates.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Domestic rates present a very different
                picture to business rates. The Northern Ireland Economic Council
                (NIEC) recently argued that policy formed for the Province must
                be based on sound evidence. That is a good piece of advice on
                which many parties in the Chamber should reflect. Some parties’
                comments about the domestic rating situation have been less than
                frank, perhaps because they are overly excited at the prospect
                of a forthcoming general election.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here are some of the relevant facts: in the
                year 2000-01, the total regional and district rates in Northern
                Ireland averaged £386. I base those figures on work carried out
                by the Assembly’s research and information department. That
                compares to an average council tax for England, in the same
                year, of £697. There is a considerable difference. However, we
                must remember that in England and Wales, householders pay a
                quite considerable, additional amount of money. In 1999-2000,
                they paid £248 on average to the private water companies for
                water rates. The total bill in England and Wales, equivalent to
                the combination of our district and regional rate, is around
                £950, whereas here it is under £400.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is true that average incomes are lower in
                Northern Ireland. However, the average income for a property
                owner in Northern Ireland is around 90% of the England and Wales
                average. However, our average rates bill totals about 40% of
                that of England and Wales.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that, and that the projected increase
                in domestic rates is to be 7% in Northern Ireland — the same
                as this year’s projected council tax rate in England and Wales
                — it is hard to argue in principle against that percentage
                increase, however politically attractive it may be. No doubt,
                some Members will do so because of the anticipated election.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member accept that the cost of
                electricity, fuel, clothing, and so on, is substantially higher
                in Northern Ireland than in Great Britain and that that must be
                taken into consideration?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his point. He has been
                one of the main crusaders on the issue, but I continue to
                believe that the statistical evidence suggests that his crusade
                against the domestic rates increase is a misguided one. It is
                true that some categories of domestic expenditure in the
                Province are lower than in England and Wales, but not in every
                case. Average mortgage payments, for example, are lower here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also bear in mind the Barnett
                formula. Our Executive will find it hard to argue for an
                increase in public spending in Northern Ireland — based on
                claims of higher needs — if at the same time we have a rates
                bill that is much less, on average, than that in England and
                Wales. Moreover, we are also trying to have a lower percentage
                increase in those rates.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me turn to the issue of whether we should
                change the base of local property taxation. I get the impression
                from some parties in the Chamber that they feel that a base in
                terms of assessed rental property values is an unfair one. It
                has been argued, for example, that families of different sizes
                or incomes living in the same house size and location are being
                treated unfairly because they end up paying the same domestic
                rates bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All that that argument is really saying is
                that the regional rate is not an income tax, which is simply a
                statement of the obvious. I wonder whether some of the parties
                who have opposed the 7% increase in the domestic regional rate
                are really arguing for a poll tax, which would get around this
                apparent — and I stress &quot;apparent&quot; — anomaly. I
                see that Mr Close is shaking his head. Perhaps they are arguing
                for a supplement to income tax — that people in Northern
                Ireland should pay a higher rate of income tax than other parts
                of the United Kingdom. Well, if that is what they — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member accept that because of the
                way that the housing benefit system operates in relation to rate
                relief, it really is a form of poll tax? The number of people
                who live in a house becomes part of the housing benefit
                assessment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not think that that is relevant to the
                point I am making.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If parties want to change the system of
                property taxation from the current assessed rental values, they
                must be very clear whether they want to base it on a poll tax
                standard or a change in the standard rate of income tax. We will
                need to think very carefully whether that is the road that we
                want to go down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I favour keeping the tax base as wide as
                possible. Indeed, that is the position of the Ulster Unionist
                Party. A tax on property — in some form — should be included
                so that the rate of tax can be kept as low as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Should we have what is, in effect, a separate
                or regional form of taxation in Northern Ireland? It can be
                claimed — and I must concede that there is some force in the
                arguments put forward — that the regional rate has become a
                sort of regional tax by default. Should we continue with that
                situation or should we attempt to move to a different form of
                regional taxation? The economic theory is that if we were to
                have a specific regional tax it might make all of us — and the
                Executive in particular — more responsible in our spending
                decisions. If the House and the Executive wished to present the
                case for an increase in public spending, we would also be
                answerable to the electorate for raising the revenues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suppose that, in theory, there is something
                attractive in that situation. It would certainly make Assembly
                Members and members of the Executive think twice about
                suggesting increases in public spending willy-nilly. However,
                that is very much a theoretical argument, and it is not clear
                how it would work in practice. I note that, although the
                Scottish Parliament has the power to increase income tax above
                the standard UK rate by 3p in the pound, that power has not yet
                been used. I do not think that it is likely to be used in the
                foreseeable future. As I said earlier, if Members want Northern
                Ireland to have an income tax rate higher than that in the rest
                of the United Kingdom, they must bear in mind the disincentive
                effects that it would impose.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That would be a further disincentive, over
                and above some of the points that Mr Close made in his
                intervention about our higher energy charges, for example. The
                whole issue of whether there should be regional discretion on
                taxation is one which this House will have to return.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party and I welcome this Budget. As we
                consider tax levels and types of taxes, we should bear in mind
                that this House will be failing all the people of Northern
                Ireland if it does not spend as much time seeking to devise
                policies to increase the total amount of wealth in the Northern
                Ireland economy as it spends debating policies that seek to
                redistribute wealth.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Dr Birnie said, this is the first Budget
                that we have seen from a Northern Ireland Government for many
                years. The introduction of resource-based Estimates means that
                we can move away from cash Estimates alone, towards expenditure
                on resource and cash bases. The most important thing is that the
                Budget will now be administered by local Ministers, which will
                help to reassure the Northern Irish public that local issues
                will actually be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Departments now have the opportunity to
                redirect or prioritise many aspects of their expenditure, and
                there is the opportunity for innovation and, in particular, for
                Departments to become proactive rather than reactive with their
                budgets. Value for money is essential in order to promote
                optimum return from the limited resources available, which will
                involve allocating funds to particular areas of need and social
                deprivation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly is at a crossroads, and we must
                address the years of underfunding of direct rule. We must set
                realistic targets to redress the balance and to target social
                need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The additional moneys available through the
                Budget to schools will, I hope, ensure that the Minister of
                Education can prioritise the issue of mobile classrooms, and in
                particular the conditions in which many of our children are
                being taught. In addition, there is the possibility that the
                Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety will
                ring-fence money, particularly for mental health.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those issues, along with many more, will be a
                testament to our intention, as a new Government, to begin the
                process of change. Part of the uniqueness of the devolved
                Government is interdepartmental working. A good example of that
                is the promotion of interdepartmental co-ordination to deal with
                the issues affecting people with disabilities. That is one of
                the most positive measures to build a stronger, more concerted
                way to alleviate current difficulties, and to promote social
                inclusion for one of the most disadvantaged sections of our
                population.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our aim should be to provide better access to
                services and facilities for the disabled, thus bringing them
                into line with the rest of society. With this combined effort
                across Departments, there will also be improved access to
                cultural and leisure facilities for people with disabilities.
                That will promote access to both social and work activities,
                which can only be seen as a very positive move towards inclusion
                for the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The targets defined in the Programme for
                Government must be regularly reviewed and examined to enable us
                to turn them into realistically achievable objectives. We cannot
                do that without adequate funding in the first place. The new
                facility to borrow on account will enable the Departments to
                ensure continuity in the provision and delivery of services. I
                support the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this Bill, the Minister of Finance and
                Personnel, once again, is apparently in a very generous mood.
                Unfortunately, he does not seem to know to whom he should be
                most generous. I am sure that that is part of his main problem,
                which raises a fundamental point: upon what basis is the
                Minister making his decisions? How will we know whether he has
                all the information that he requires in order to make those
                decisions? What criteria will he use for deciding the rules for
                disbursement? Such fundamental issues will form the basis upon
                which he can show his generosity. I hope that he will clear
                those issues up.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is anger about the above-inflation
                increase to the regional rate. If more money has been found, we
                should go back to the drawing board on that wild and ludicrous
                rise. There will be an outcry throughout the country when the
                rates bills start coming in. I will tell my constituents that
                the Executive are to blame.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not the first time that we have heard
                the announcement of further moneys. The Department seems to be
                unsure about how much money there is in the kitty at any given
                time, so we get frequent piecemeal announcements. The Northern
                Ireland Audit Office should go over the finances and tell us
                exactly what is available. There is a general impression that
                not only is there a lot of money, but there would be even more
                were the Minister to look in the right places. If that is the
                case, I have no doubt that the Minister of Finance and Personnel
                will be out on the highways and byways searching for the money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not want a repeat of the fiasco of the
                trust deficits. Some trusts, such as the Royal Victoria
                Hospital, have a culture of overspending. The Minister should
                take a close look at that. There is a perception in the
                community and in the Health Service that some trusts just spend
                and spend and that no one monitors the situation. That is a sad
                reflection on the Health Service. Health professionals tell me
                that they feel that there is a mentality that the only thing
                that matters is the survival of the Royal Victoria Hospital,
                even if that would mean the closure of the entire Health
                Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Republic of Ireland’s financial
                scandals, which have led to the setting up of numerous
                tribunals, may pale into insignificance in comparison to the
                evident wanton disregard of this Executive. It is essential,
                therefore, that the Minister knows what is happening. Has he
                approached the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                about a reduction in the number of quangos? Huge savings could
                be legitimately made if that were done, but the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister have said nothing on that matter.
                What is the Minister’s policy to reduce bureaucracy in order
                to make savings and, thus, reduce the need to raise the regional
                rate?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is anger in the community about the
                lack of funding for the Health Service. The Minister made a
                welcome statement last week about tackling the trust deficits.
                However, more needs to be done, and more money must be invested
                in the Health Service, so that everyone in Northern Ireland and
                the Health Service can deal with the community’s problems.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most important effects of
                devolution is that we have inherited the problem of the gross
                underfunding of public utilities over the past 20 years. It is
                not just health and education; the whole infrastructure has been
                affected. I hope that the Assembly will address these issues,
                not only this year but also in years to come.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The importance of devolution is that it
                essentially creates greater accountability. We have not totally
                fulfilled our role of providing accountable government at this
                stage. I say so for several reasons, one being that we are a
                fledgling Assembly. If we are to fulfil our role of providing
                accountable government, the scrutiny role, of Committees in
                particular, must be greatly increased. The Assembly and
                devolution provide the opportunity to bring about change and to
                deal with the issues affecting the people of Northern Ireland. I
                will mention a few of those for the benefit of the Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, there is the question of the natural
                gas pipeline to the north-west. I still think that there is not
                enough clarity about the Executive’s role in that project —
                whether they are being aggressive enough in providing a level
                playing field for all the people of Northern Ireland. When I
                talk about the pipeline I include the west of the Province,
                Craigavon, Newry, and so forth. It is important for us to be
                strategic in planning our infrastructure for the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Budget takes into account the
                creation of the single development agency for industrial
                development in Northern Ireland. This is a very radical move
                forward and I hope that the necessary funds will be made
                available for it. As regards infrastructure, the Assembly has
                inherited a railway network that is more or less clapped out and
                on its knees. Sufficient funds must be made available in the
                coming year to bring about the radical changes required to
                improve the rail network. That should include the retention of
                the line between Lisburn and Antrim.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will be aware that I am still deeply
                concerned about the future of the port of Belfast. Delays on
                reaching a decision on its future are creating problems for port
                users and for Northern Ireland’s transport infrastructure.
                That is because the port plays such a key role in providing
                access to the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people have expressed concern about the
                delays and lack of clarity about the future of Peace II funding
                — especially those in the voluntary sector. I want some
                clarification about what is happening. Many voluntary
                organisations do not know whether they will survive into next
                week, never mind next month. The Executive has a role to respond
                to such serious concerns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One principle that I would like to have seen
                encapsulated in the Programme for Government is that of sharing.
                If we are to move forward in Northern Ireland, we must do so
                through the creation of a more integrated society. It is not
                just a question of integrated education. We have to address the
                principle of sharing housing, the workplace and many other
                areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his opening remarks, the Minister referred
                to the Barnett formula. We all want to see that issue addressed.
                Nevertheless, I suggest to the Minister that similar concerns
                are felt by Members of the Scottish Parliament and of the
                National Assembly for Wales, so it would be helpful if the three
                devolved bodies got together on that important matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie mentioned public service agreements
                (PSAs). They will provide major opportunities for developing
                innovative improvements to life in Northern Ireland. However,
                this year, very little time was given to various Committees to
                address the whole question of PSAs. I was particularly concerned
                about the fact that, in relation to the Department of
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment, so much more money is to be
                spent on the electricity interconnector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In an area where a great deal of money has
                already been spent — and the scheme is fairly well advanced
                — surely this money could have been directed to other energy
                schemes that would provide greater benefit to people in Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that the Assembly is working.
                People on the streets are beginning to see change. Reference was
                made to the introduction of free transport for the elderly.
                However, many more issues need to be addressed. Only by
                operating a system of accountable government and allowing the
                Committees to have a greater scrutiny role will we be able to
                provide the accountability that my party and the people of
                Northern Ireland want.</p>

                and Personnel Committee, Mr Leslie.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker, you kindly called me as
                the Deputy Chairperson of the Finance and Personnel Committee. I
                should point out that my remarks on these issues will be made in
                my personal capacity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Mr Neeson had been here yesterday, he
                would have heard some remarks about the Barnett formula, which
                were quite pertinent to what he has just said. If he were to go
                to Scotland he might be surprised to find that there is
                exceedingly little enthusiasm for revisiting the Barnett
                formula, because the Scots do rather well out of it. If you were
                to try to renegotiate the Barnett formula, you would find
                Northern Ireland saying &quot;The Scots should have less, so
                that we can have more.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the current construction of the
                Government, I am not sure how well that argument would wash.
                Those are matters that no doubt the Minister will have to
                wrestle with again in the future. Enough was said on that
                subject yesterday, especially by me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his remarks about the Health Service, Mr
                Berry referred to his concern that the money was probably not
                being spent as well as it might be. I dare say that that may be
                the case. However, I thought it conspicuous that the Member did
                not refer to the recent Northern Ireland Audit Office Report,
                which identified the very considerable shortcomings in the
                administration of social security payments by the Department for
                Social Development. Indeed, as regards the quantum of sums over
                which the Northern Ireland Audit Office expressed concerns, the
                greatest related to methods in the Department for Social
                Development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I dare say that the reason Mr Berry did not
                see fit to mention this is that, of course, that Department is
                run by a Minister from his own party. Perhaps he should urge his
                Colleagues to put their own house in order while he is urging
                others to do the same.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another matter in relation to the Department
                for Social Development concerns me, and I trust that the move to
                resource accounting will highlight the issue. I refer to housing
                debt — a matter that is dear to your heart, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At each monitoring round so far, it has been
                stated that a considerable proportion of the proceeds — about
                one third, at the last monitoring round — has come from sales
                of Housing Executive stock. We then gleefully spend that money.
                However, the House should be aware that that is living off
                capital and that, meanwhile, the Housing Executive bears debt
                incurred from the cost of those houses and has to service the
                interest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resource accounting will provide a proper
                picture of assets and liabilities, and I trust that it will
                become very clear that this is a deteriorating situation. I hope
                that the Minister of Finance is concerned about the matter and
                that he will be discussing how it should be addressed with the
                Minister for Social Development. Some way must be found to
                reduce the debt; otherwise the more houses that are sold, the
                less rental income the Housing Executive will have with which to
                service the debt. That is becoming a serious problem, and it
                will get more serious as more houses are sold. The Assembly must
                be made aware that while it is busily spending this capital an
                increasingly underfunded liability is building up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rates issues go round and round, and as
                my Colleague Dr Birnie said, several parties are trying to be
                disingenuous about it in order to score political points as an
                election approaches. It is simply not possible to demand more
                money and then deny the source for raising that money. The pool
                of money available for public expenditure in Northern Ireland is
                set by the Barnett formula essentially and is a grant of money
                from the Parliament at Westminster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must be conscious at all times that
                unoffical estimates — there are no official estimates —
                imply that Northern Ireland’s tax base would probably
                contribute roughly half of total public expenditure in the
                Province. Therefore the other half is contributed by taxpayers
                in the rest of the United Kingdom, and when one examines that
                figure, one realises that it is being contributed by English
                taxpayers. They are also funding Scotland and Wales, though not
                to the same extent as Northern Ireland. We must be conscious
                that we are living off other people’s generosity. We should
                therefore temper our demands in this respect, lest the whole
                issue be investigated in detail. That may put Northern Ireland
                in a somewhat disadvantagous position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have said in the House on many occasions
                — and I will continue to do so — that I am no fan of
                taxation. Rates are a form of taxation. The best way to
                stimulate an economy is to try to reduce all types of taxation
                and allow money to be spent as people, rather than the
                Government, choose. That may not work to people’s benefit as
                much as the Government might like to think.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In reality, if we are going to continue
                demanding more money — be it for public transport or the
                Health Service — it has to come from somewhere. Apart from the
                grant from Westminster, the only other source is rates. I would
                be reluctant to increase rates by anything other than a very
                modest rate, and we must be highly cognizant at all times of the
                value of services we get for that money. I simply do not think
                it realistic to demand money without explaining where it will
                come from.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You will get more money if you have less
                government, for every aspect of government costs money. If one
                has less government, there will be more money or less tax —
                one can take one’s pick. In particular, I remind the Minister
                that the Committee has mentioned to him from time to time the
                need for a review of the cost of governance. I regard that as an
                increasingly pressing matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will be conscious that a review of
                public administration, including quangos, trusts and boards, and
                the structure of councils is expected reasonably soon. An
                essential objective of the review should be that the resulting
                administration should cost significantly less than it does at
                present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That seems to me to be the best approach we
                can take towards making more money available for other aspects
                of public expenditure, given that there will always be demands
                vastly in excess of what is available.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. I did not intend to
                speak this morning, as a great deal was said about this
                yesterday. I certainly do not want to repeat yesterday’s
                comments. However, Mr&nbsp;Leslie has referred to them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party is very conscious of the need for
                the question of finance raising to be discussed. We know and
                accept entirely that one cannot continually make demands without
                making the provision to satisfy those demands. We are acutely
                aware of that, which is why I stated yesterday that there is a
                need not only for a review of the rates — which has already
                been mentioned several times — but also for an overview of
                finance raising by the Executive and the Assembly as a whole.
                That deals with Barnett, tax variations, and so on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about some of the remarks made
                by Mr Paul Berry of the DUP in regard to health trust deficit;
                there was a mixed message from Mr Berry, and Hansard should show
                that. He made offensive remarks about some of the health trusts
                when he talked about their deficits and about the review that
                was mentioned last week by the Minister, Mark Durkan. Concerning
                the health trust deficit, he said that the trusts have an awful
                habit of overspending. In fact, he said that they have &quot;a
                culture of overspending&quot; and specifically mentioned the
                Royal Victoria Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His comments were quite disgraceful, given
                the record of questions and motions tabled by DUP Members,
                particularly in regard to health matters. If one added up the
                bill for all the demands that they have made, one would find
                that it would amount to a considerable sum of money. That is
                fair enough — we support many of those demands.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because the matter was raised in the way that
                it was by the DUP, I want the Minister, in his closing remarks,
                to acknowledge that the matter of health trust deficits is not
                simply one of mismanagement or overspending by the trusts, but
                that there is a very clear shortfall in the budgets of most of
                those trusts. The health needs of the people whom those trusts
                serve must also be dealt with and calculated.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs I Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to hear what the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel had to tell us about his
                spending arrangements. We must consider the amount of waste that
                has been exposed by the Northern Ireland Audit Office. For
                example, in the Department of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety payments of £17 million were made without any clear
                evidence to support them. On the subject of health, can the
                Minister advise us whether any of the extra moneys allocated to
                health will be used towards paying for the Minister’s legal
                advice in respect of her decision to close the Jubilee Hospital?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about the surpluses in many
                Departments; they do not seem to have any impact on future
                estimations. Perhaps the Minister will deal with that issue in
                his summing up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned at the absence of any
                reference by the Minister to the vast amount of fraud that is
                costing all Departments millions of pounds. What pressure is he
                bringing to bear on Departments concerning fraud? In the Health
                Department, for example, £14&nbsp;million is lost through
                prescription fraud alone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That brings me to the recent issue of organ
                retention. Will the Minister be giving money to the Department
                of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in order to give
                assistance to families who have to bear the extra cost of
                reopening graves? One elderly person who rang me had received a
                grant of £800 to help bury her late husband, who died some six
                months ago. The grant fell short by approximately £500, and she
                is still trying to pay this off. She now has to reopen the grave
                — at a cost of £250 — after her late husband’s organs
                were returned. If there is money available, the Government
                should provide some to help to rectify this tragedy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Departments made a catalogue of errors.
                The Northern Ireland Appropriation Accounts for 1999-2000 list
                areas in which error after error was made. Will the Minister
                tell us what he intends to do about that? Will he consider that
                the sums involved may equal or exceed the amount that he is
                dealing with today?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is money in the system, and that makes
                the above-inflation rate hike unnecessary. Will the Minister
                look again at the money available and consider whether the rate
                increase can be reduced further? When householders receive their
                rates bill for the next financial year they will realise the
                vast bureaucracy and costs that have come from the Belfast
                Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister is receiving another huge increase of
                £193,000 for setting up an office in Brussels. Can the Minister
                of Finance tell us what he will do to reduce such bureaucracy?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that extra money exists, it is
                imperative that it is distributed fairly. In the education
                sector, for example, there is a huge gap between the
                underfunding of capital projects in the controlled schools
                sector and the lavish amounts spent on the maintained and
                integrated schools sector. Old school buildings must be
                improved. There are schools in the Strangford constituency that
                are over 100 years old and unfit for educational purposes. Any
                extra money should be targeted at those schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Money must also be given to small rural
                schools. After much lobbying, the primary school in Derryboy in
                the Strangford constituency is being extended. However, that
                school will require ongoing resources to maintain its standards.
                Will the Minister target money towards small rural schools?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The biggest problem facing schools such as
                Derryboy Primary School is the transfer of pupils to the nearest
                high school, which, in this case, is Saintfield High School.
                Derryboy is a feeder school for Saintfield High School, which is
                unable to take all the pupils. Extra money should be spent in
                Killyleagh, where a new school could be built to deal with the
                rise in population and future developments in Strangford.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the mention of winter fuel
                payments. That issue has been debated in the Assembly and
                Members have raised it with Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about job losses in the
                textile sector. Will the Minister tell the House what moneys can
                be identified in his Estimates that will go directly towards
                combating the depressed state of the textile industry? If there
                is no such money, why is that so, and will he do something about
                it?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What extra money is available to resolve the
                debate about maternity services? Will there be extra funding to
                provide for the new build at the appropriate locations? The
                historic underfunding of the Ulster Hospital is another matter
                of concern. For a decade, the hospital has been by-passed in
                capital expenditure rise. However, the Department of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety is aware of the needs of the
                hospital. Will the Minister take that issue on board?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The list of issues that must be tackled is
                huge and I am concerned that Members did not have enough time to
                examine the issues in greater detail. Will the Minister tell
                Members that more time will be given for their thorough analysis
                of his proposals the next time that he announces his Budget
                Estimates?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend this historic Budget. It is
                appropriate that the Assembly is moving into the era of setting
                its own Budget. Mr Maskey, Mrs I Robinson and others raised the
                issue of financial control. I am a member of the Public Accounts
                Committee, so I am aware of the huge discrepancies outlined in
                the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly needs to know how much control
                the Minister will have to ensure that such a report never
                appears again. Will this new type of resource budgeting lead to
                better financial controls and ensure better handling of public
                money all round?</p>

                Robinson, concerned not just time for Members to review the
                Budget, but also a clearer understanding of the procedure and
                the process. There is no breakdown of where the money is going.
                We have no idea how much funding will be provided next year for
                the children’s fund, women’s issues and road safety. It is
                vital that we see the breakdown. Can we learn any lessons, and
                in the next budgetary round lay out details and put Estimates
                down hand-in-hand with the Budget Bill?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much adding and subtracting is required to
                work out how much we receive in one financial year compared to
                the previous year. What are the increases and the decreases?
                What are the percentages? We need to have easy access to those
                figures so that we can make comparisons and decide whether to
                support the movement forward. Mrs&nbsp;I Robinson referred to
                the textiles industry, which is another important matter. We
                need to know what is being done there, and we need to have a
                breakdown of exactly where the money is going.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I disagree with Mrs&nbsp;I Robinson’s point
                about the lavish amounts being spent on integrated education. I
                totally denounce that. Integrated education has been around only
                for the past 20&nbsp;years, since 1981, and the other sectors
                have been receiving money for a lot longer. It is about
                integrated education catching up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are only at the draft Programme for
                Government stage. How flexible will the Budget be to accommodate
                changing priorities as a result of the approval of the Programme
                for Government? Are we being given a fait accompli, or can the
                money be moved? There are many other ongoing negotiations with
                regard to the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have two final points. First, there is the
                problem of European funding and funding of the gap between
                Peace&nbsp;I and Peace&nbsp;II. I commend the Minister on his
                efforts to provide gap funding for projects that otherwise would
                have had to close as a result of the lack of European funding.
                Gap funding is needed for projects for women returners, projects
                for the long-term unemployed, projects for cross-border issues
                and projects that have no finance other than European money.
                Funding is needed to sustain them until the new round of
                European funds is available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, serious consideration should be
                given to mainstreaming these projects. We cannot rely on
                European money for the rest of our time, and we are all aware
                that it is running out. The Government and the Executive need to
                recognise the value of these projects, such as cross-border,
                cross-community peace and reconciliation projects, which are
                very important to the future of Northern Ireland. They should be
                funded not just from European funds, but from Executive funds.
                Mainstreaming is vital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have had calls from people in voluntary and
                environmental organisations, saying that they can see the money
                in the Executive Programme funds and want to know how to get
                their hands on it. Transparency and openness are vital. I want
                to know what the Minister will do about that. How does a group
                access those funds?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a need for more clarity and
                explanation about how the Executive Programme funds will be
                managed and used. Ms Morrice asked how groups can access them.
                They will not get access. I understand that it is Departments
                that will get access, by making bids. Therein lies a whole
                series of other questions such as how those bids will be
                prioritised and how Departments should manage the submission of
                such bids. Will they be asked to come forward with new ideas
                following the drawing-up of their own priorities? Can they put
                forward bids on issues that are already part of their own
                spending priorities? We need more explanation about how those
                funds will be managed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the concerns raised is that, to some
                extent, a reserve of money has been held back by the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister, in particular. No doubt,
                as has happened with other announcements, the Finance Minister
                will be given the plum job of coming to the Assembly to make an
                announcement, whereas the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister will have already announced it at a press conference in
                the Long Gallery.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an issue when the Executive, or the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in particular, make
                announcements during the course of the year on public spending
                priorities. I hope that when there is bad news to announce, the
                Finance Minister will ensure that the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister will rush forward with the same alacrity
                into the Long Gallery on a Thursday evening to make
                announcements. They seem pretty selective in the announcements
                that they make.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The scrutiny of the Budget has clearly been
                unsatisfactory up to now. Reasons have been given, such as the
                time constraints we have been under. The Minister gave
                commitments yesterday and on previous occasions that the cycle
                will be revised to ensure that the Budget is introduced as early
                as possible after the summer recess. I welcome that. It is vital
                to have as much debate and scrutiny of these Budgets as
                possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister also made the important point,
                which we should all take note of, that we do not need to wait
                for the start of any particular procedure in order to begin this
                process. This is something that we can pursue actively, at all
                times, in our Committees and elsewhere. That is an issue that we
                need to look at very closely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also want to discuss the regional rate
                increase. I am sure that the Minister will not be surprised to
                hear me raise it. At the time, I welcomed the fact that the
                increase in the business rate for next year would be reduced
                from more than double the rate of inflation to about the rate of
                inflation. However, the Minister reduced the increase in the
                regional rate for domestic householders by only 1% — from 8%
                to 7%. That is a great failing on his part, and on the part of
                the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a valiant effort, Dr Birnie — who has
                left the Chamber — defended that decision by saying that it
                was hard to argue against it; it is not hard to argue against it
                at all. We are being asked to accept a rise in the regional rate
                for domestic householders that is double the rate of inflation.
                Those people have already faced such an increase in the past two
                years. What is the Minister’s plan for the next two years?
                Originally, he planned another 8% increase over the next two
                years, so I would be grateful to know whether he has revised
                that plan in light of the representations made to him on the
                issue, not just in the House but outside it as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie argued that if we wanted to spend
                more money, we would have to explain where we would get it from.
                He was quite right; that is exactly why, in tabling an amendment
                to reduce the increase in the regional rate from 8%, as it then
                was — it is now 7% — to the rate of inflation, we suggested
                areas in which expenditure should be cut. I remind Mr Leslie and
                other Members what those areas were: the North/South Ministerial
                Council and the implementation bodies. That would fit in well
                with Mr Leslie’s other comment that we would get value for
                money by having less government. Well, that is one suggestion
                for him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rather than trotting out clichés about
                seeing where the money will come from before making bids, my
                party outlined where the cuts should be and suggested that the
                Budget should be amended accordingly. Unfortunately, Mr Leslie
                and his Colleagues voted against it, preferring to have more,
                rather than less, government and bureaucracy, and all for
                political reasons. I remind Mr Leslie and his Colleagues and
                Members from other parties who talk about expenditure on
                administration that it was they who voted to have 10
                Departments. Many of us argued that that number of Departments
                was unnecessary and would simply increase the cost; the Minister
                gave a figure of £26 million a year to the Finance and
                Personnel Committee. That is food for thought for Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie referred to Mr Berry’s speech,
                which criticised some aspects of health expenditure. He asked
                why Mr Berry had not raised the question of expenditure caused
                by social security errors. That issue is being addressed by the
                Department for Social Development, whose plans received general
                endorsement from the House. No one will make any excuses for
                errors or fraud; those problems must be dealt with. However,
                many who are entitled to benefits under the present system do
                not claim their full entitlement; that is sometimes forgotten.
                Tens of millions of pounds are left unclaimed every year by
                those who are entitled to benefit.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a good point and one that needs to be
                put on the record.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people in west Belfast may have been
                misled by the poor example shown by the Sinn Féin Member for
                that area as regards the charge of the abuse of benefits that is
                directed at people with genuine disabilities. Should there be
                any doubt as to which Sinn Féin Member I am referring to, it is
                Mr Maskey.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards social security, the rules for
                entitlement, and the difficulties in procedures for social
                security claimants are set down in Westminster, not in this
                Assembly. The problems and difficulties that occur here also
                occur across the water. This issue must be addressed in
                consultation with Alistair Darling, the Secretary of State for
                Social Security.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie — and this is not a &quot;bash Mr
                Leslie&quot; day, although he did take a potshot at us — did
                not mention the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report
                regarding the revelations surrounding the Northern Ireland
                Tourist Board (NITB). The report identified great weaknesses in
                financial procedures. I throw the same question to him: perhaps
                he did not mention it because a Member of his party is the
                Minister responsible for the NITB.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I mention the vexed question
                of capital receipts and house sales — an issue that has come
                before the House before. Mr Leslie raised the matter, and I
                commend him for that. There is a danger in living off capital
                receipts. Furthermore, there is a strong argument that if so
                much money is being taken out of the housing sector in Northern
                Ireland, then a greater proportion of that money needs to go
                back into the sector to address the great social need that is
                there. In common with other Members, I urge the Minister to look
                carefully at that. I understand that there are constraints in
                terms of Treasury rules; however, as regards the Minister’s
                monitoring rounds, I urge him to take account of the pleas of
                many in the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although many points have been competently
                and articulately dealt with by other Members, I must address the
                relationship between the finances of Northern Ireland — as
                administered by the Assembly — and those of the United
                Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance in Northern Ireland
                has the unenviable job of allotting portions of the cake to
                particular sectors; however, it is the Chancellor of the
                Exchequer who determines the size of the cake. What steps has
                the Minister taken, or will take, in relation to the finances of
                Northern Ireland that will address the peculiar problems arising
                from steps taken on reserved fiscal matters, which have a dire
                and particularly acute effect on the Northern Ireland economy?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister also state what steps he
                has taken, or will take, to address the effects for Northern
                Ireland of being the only part of the United Kingdom sharing a
                land border with a foreign country?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will be aware that the
                agriculture industry has suffered enormous hardship as a result
                of the incompetence of central Government, particularly in
                relation to BSE. This has resulted in Northern Ireland beef
                producers being lumped in with the rest of the United Kingdom as
                regards the re-entry of beef exports into Europe. This is
                despite having the best record and the best system in the EU for
                tracing and detection, and a far lower incidence of BSE than in
                any other part of the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was despite the fact that the proportion
                of beef cattle produced in Northern Ireland that went for export
                to Europe was far, far greater than that from any other part of
                the United Kingdom. As a result, Northern Ireland suffered
                disproportionately.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to hear the Minister’s comments on
                fuel — motor spirit and other fuels. He will be aware that
                since 1995, the level of motor fuel lawfully imported into
                Northern Ireland has dropped by perhaps 50%, at a time when the
                number of lawfully registered vehicles here has increased by
                125,000. Everyone knows that perhaps one third of all motor fuel
                used in Northern Ireland is the product of smuggling and that
                the Treasury is losing not tens of millions, but hundreds of
                millions a year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, let us set aside for the moment what
                the Treasury is losing and look at the effect that this
                smuggling — which is effectively controlled by paramilitaries,
                represented by parties in this Assembly — is having on lawful
                traders in Northern Ireland. Petrol retailers are closing
                because they cannot compete with those selling smuggled fuel.
                Hauliers are going out of business because while central
                Government are increasing the duty on motor fuel, the Government
                of the Republic of Ireland — starting off from a lower charge
                for fuel — are reducing it. I appreciate that the Minister has
                no direct control over this, but these matters are seriously
                influencing the economic well-being of Northern Ireland. It will
                be interesting to hear what steps the Minister, the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister have taken to ensure
                special arrangements for Northern Ireland, since we are in a
                special position. We have a land border with another country,
                whose economic position enables it — largely through the
                payment of British funds into the EU, which are then used to
                subsidise the Republic — to have lower fuel prices that are
                used in turn to destroy some of our industries to the benefit of
                the Republic and to the detriment of the British Exchequer. Some
                of those issues need to be looked at.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for drawing the Minister’s
                attention to that list. Would he add to it the tax on
                aggregates? That is another issue affecting the Northern Ireland

                have a discriminatory effect on those businesses in Northern
                Ireland that are utilising aggregates and other substances
                heavily used in the construction industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another is the climate control levy, which
                will be levied in Northern Ireland and will have a very severe
                effect on our industry and industrialists. Already we have the
                highest electricity costs in the United Kingdom. Why? It is not,
                I am glad to say, because of anything done by this Assembly; it
                is due to the incompetence of central Government when they

                with contracts that are uneconomic and over-generous, and that
                apparently cannot be changed. It also means that the Northern
                Ireland business user pays way over the odds for his
                electricity, as does the domestic user. With regard to business
                energy costs, there is no suggestion that special arrangements
                will be made for the climate change levy for Northern Ireland to
                take into account the excessive costs for energy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate that many of these matters are
                outside the control of the Assembly, the Executive and the
                relevant Minister. What we want from the Minister is a statement
                regarding the representations that he and his Colleagues will
                make to central Government to specifically look at problems
                arising from our geographical position. Those problems require
                not special treatment in the sense that we are preferred above
                other parts of the United Kingdom, but special treatment in the
                sense that our peculiar difficulties arising from our
                geographical position are catered for.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to focus on several issues. The
                Assembly has been granted one tax-raising power — that of
                increasing rates. When anyone is given a power there is an
                overwhelming inducement to exercise it, whether it is justified
                or not. Having been given a power to raise money through
                increasing the domestic and the regional rate, the Executive
                could not resist using that power even though the revenue it
                would produce would be minuscule compared to the harm it would
                do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At an earlier sitting, I asked the Minister
                whether he was aware that many in the community were astonished
                to find that he was able to unearth millions of pounds worth of
                finance by hoking down the side of the sofa or rummaging behind
                the piano, as I put it rather graphically and colourfully.
                Curiously enough, none of this newly found, some might say
                ill-gotten, gain was used to reduce rates, except business
                rates. I approached the Minister privately and was glad to note
                — and I give him full credit — that he came before the
                Assembly and announced a reduction in the proposed increase in
                the business rate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Small businesses provide the backbone of our
                commercial life. None of them is making vast sums. Many of them
                continue as small businesses only out of a desire to be
                independent and to work for themselves. They pay their rates and
                taxes; they educate their children; they do not draw
                unemployment or other state benefits. They are the backbone of
                this community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of my constituents in Holywood, a single
                parent running a small business, found that her rates had
                increased over the past four years, due to revaluation and rate
                increases, from £70 to £242 per month. The result was that, if
                the proposed business rate increase had been put through, she
                was simply going to close her business.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems illogical for the Executive to be
                handing out millions upon millions to the IDB for the purchase
                of new jobs, sometimes at up to £40,000 per job. Very often the
                people who are coming in here, attracted by the huge grants and
                subsidies, are on the fly. Once they have exhausted the
                possibilities of making an easy buck and the going gets tough,
                they leave. Everyone in this community — Unionist and
                Nationalist — suffers. This money is being paid out to attract
                new jobs, while rate increases are effectively destroying the
                livelihood and jobs of those who have continued to support the
                community and be of benefit to it, rather than a drag upon it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Increasing the business rate at all — even
                though it is now to be increased only in proportion to inflation
                — is a regressive step. The word in the financial world is
                that one of the steps that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will
                take when he distributes all the largesse before the next
                election is an inducement to the business community in the
                United Kingdom. He plans to reduce the business rate. We have a
                Chancellor of the Exchequer in the United Kingdom reducing the
                business rate in an economy that is extremely buoyant. We have
                the Minister in this sensitive, accountable Northern Ireland
                Executive proposing to increase the business rate for businesses
                that are under the cosh. If that is an example of the Assembly’s
                bringing sensitivity, accountability and accessibility to the
                electorate of Northern Ireland, then the Minister should take up
                a job as a pantomime dame. That is what ordinary people will be
                saying. Why are we doing this? It defies common sense.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I want to make one or two points
                about —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Three Members want to speak before the
                winding-up speech, so please be brief.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will be very brief. I am grateful for the
                indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want simply to echo the remarks of Mrs I
                Robinson about the funding of the Ulster Hospital. The Ulster
                Hospital has been grossly underfunded for many years. Since it
                absorbed the Newtownards Hospital, the position has become
                acute. In some departments, such as the orthopaedic department,
                it has had to stop elective surgery entirely because it can cope
                with emergencies and casualties only. That situation should not
                be permitted to continue.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have heard my remarks about timing. I
                would be very grateful, therefore, if Mr Gibson, Mr Shannon and
                Mr O’Connor could keep their remarks to the main issues so
                that the Minister can respond.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I return to the point made by Mr Paul Berry
                — that we very much want to see the Ulster hallmark on the
                Minister’s Budget. What criteria is he using to set the
                direction for Northern Ireland regional Government? The Budget,
                which I am sure is a splendid account of the figures and the
                anticipated projections, is in truth a very conservative Budget.
                It probably follows in the steps of Westminster. In light of the
                arguments that have been made — and they have been reiterated
                again this morning — there are clear differences because of
                our unique position. I do not want to have to highlight those
                again, except to mention one particular field.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Figures show that hospitals in Northern
                Ireland are greatly underfunded in comparison with those in
                Scotland — apparently, there is a funding difference of
                approximately 14%. Will the Minister find out whether figures
                that show that Scottish hospitals receive 20% more funding than
                those in England and Wales, while Northern Ireland receives just
                4% to 6% more, are correct? Will he explore this matter with his
                counterparts in Westminster?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday, I raised a point of order with
                regard to rates, and I was severely admonished by you, Mr Deputy
                Speaker, so I will return to the matter today. We spend £40
                million on &quot;North/Southery&quot;, yet the infamous former
                Taoiseach, Mr Haughey, removed rates from the agenda. What
                secret did Mr Haughey hold, and why should we spend £40 million
                to find out?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The forthcoming review of local government
                will allow us to examine the different areas of administration.
                I detect a feeling among Members that we are still living with a
                hangover from direct rule. At times, I detect a reluctance on
                the part of Members to impart necessary information.
                Transparency has been requested, and we need information so that
                we can make informed judgements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Four years ago, I discovered that when the
                Western Education and Library Board and the other boards came
                under pressure to make cuts, they were suddenly able to make
                savings and streamline their administration. They were also able
                to make league tables for specific areas. What is being done to
                hone our present administration and to make it accountable?
                Dr&nbsp;Birnie and Mr Leslie meandered along various avenues to
                seek solutions to the problem, but they concluded that less
                government is needed and mentioned the need for accountability
                and responsibility. Those are important requirements, but the
                Minster of Finance and Personnel needs to focus on the areas
                which are under the most severe pressure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The entire rural community has been
                devastated by the plague of BSE. At the moment, there appears to
                be a lack of vision and strategy on the part of the Department
                of Agriculture and Rural Development. It is reactive rather than
                giving the rural community a way forward. This is the largest
                sector of the community; it needs serious attention and it
                demands help. The people there do not want to live off handouts,
                and they do not want to harvest grants alone. Farmers want to be
                restored to their rightful status as part of the primary
                industry of this Province. I appeal to the Minister of Finance
                and Personnel to take that on board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, rurality have been equated with
                deprivation. Yesterday afternoon we expressed the need to play
                catch-up in rural areas. In his Budget, Mr Durkan has the
                opportunity to make sure that we have equality, and that means
                providing capital funding for rural schools and funding an acute
                services hospital in the south-west of the Province. Those are
                basic provisions, but they are essential to enhance the meaning
                of the term &quot;rurality&quot; so that it is no longer
                associated with remoteness and deprivation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new Executive have an opportunity to
                stamp the hallmark for an Ulster way forward. At the moment, I
                fear it is lacking, but I anticipate that the Minister will do
                an honourable job in his excellent office.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must ask Members please to keep their
                remarks to about five minutes. Otherwise we will not be able to
                keep within our timescale, and we will have very little chance
                to hear the Minister.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr O’Connor:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the Minister of Finance and
                Personnel. As you yourself would probably guess, Mr Deputy
                Speaker, it is extremely important to me that I touch on issues
                pertaining to the Department for Social Development. We see a
                lot of money being spent on administration in that Department,
                and the reason is that the benefit system is far, far too
                complex. There are grave errors in the benefit and child support
                system and in the Social Security Agency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has already introduced the Child
                Support Bill, which we very much welcome. However, we want to
                see the whole system of administering benefits streamlined to
                make it much easier. Mr McCartney talked about people working to
                stay off benefit, but many people do not really have any choice.
                Their circumstances mean that they have to claim benefits such
                as disability living allowance (DLA). DLA should be the easiest
                benefit to claim; in fact, its administration makes application
                most difficult.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to incapacity benefit, people who
                are cut off and decide to appeal are relegated to income
                support, 25% of which is taken away from them. These people who
                are living on the breadline are therefore further penalised by
                anomalies in the benefits system. It takes away their right to
                appeal because they cannot afford to live on so little money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members have touched on individual needs
                in their constituencies, which would best be served by the
                relevant Minister. It is not for the Minister of Finance and
                Personnel to decide how every single pound should be spent in
                Northern Ireland. If it were, there would be no need for any
                other Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In welcoming the Budget Bill, I want to draw
                attention to the capital receipts on housing which Mr Leslie
                touched on earlier. That stock is dwindling. We cannot continue
                to go to the well for water, because sooner or later there will
                be no water in the well. What will we do then? Some of our best
                public sector housing has been sold on. We are now talking about
                going into private finance initiatives to build public-sector
                housing. I am not a businessman, but private finance means that
                somebody has to get a cut. There must be profits for
                shareholders somewhere down the line, and those will be at the
                public expense. I do not believe that that is the way forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I very much welcomed the statement from the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel in the House last Monday when
                greater powers for the Comptroller and Auditor General were
                approved by the House. The powers of the Comptroller and Auditor
                General should enable him to play a vital role in properly
                reviewing public administration and how our money is spent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also want to touch on the points made by Mr
                McCartney about the damage done to our economy by climate tax,
                aggregate tax, smuggling and counterfeiting. We also have
                corporation tax, which makes it difficult to compete on a level
                playing field. What Mr McCartney has just done is show how much
                better off we would all be in an Irish Republic.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, Mr O’Connor. Your last few words
                raised the temperature somewhat.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call Mr Shannon and ask him to be as brief
                as possible.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first issue I want to address is roads.
                The Minister of Finance and Personnel will say that he has no
                responsibility for roads; that that is the responsibility of the
                Minister for Regional Development. However, if sufficient funds
                were made available to that Minister, he could make use of them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Comber bypass has been a point of
                discussion for 30 years. Both local councils have seen the
                bypass as their number one priority. We have had various
                assurances from Government Ministers; Ministers who flew in on a
                Monday morning, flew out on a Friday and told us that the Comber
                bypass was one of their priorities. Still we have no bypass, and
                that is having a detrimental effect on Comber. Many factories
                and shops have shut down. The town is stagnating and local
                retail trade has decreased by almost 50%. The Department has not
                addressed this issue, and I am making a plea for an urgent
                allocation of money for the construction of the Comber bypass.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bypass was originally planned for 2001;
                it has now been postponed until 2003-04. The problem of traffic
                and congestion was recognised some 30 years ago, but the problem
                has still to be addressed. We can do something if sufficient
                funds are set aside. The need for the bypass has been well
                documented locally and in the Department for Regional
                Development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, I want to address the lack of
                health and social services funding, especially for special
                schools. Speech and language therapy and occupational therapy
                have been reduced in special schools. The Department of Health
                says that it is not its responsibility, as does the Department
                of Education. The two Departments are playing ball with children’s
                special needs. That has been a matter of concern in the Eastern
                Health and Social Services Board area, where severe underfunding
                has made it necessary to cut back on therapy sessions for
                children. Funding is needed for resources and staffing. The
                staff provide a special service, but they are trying to balance
                resources with needs and responsibilities. Schools must meet the
                complex needs of each child. Each child’s circumstances are
                unique and need special care. It is important that funding is
                set aside for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my constituency of Strangford, discussions
                with the Eastern Health and Social Services Board about
                resources for therapy have not come to a fruitful conclusion.
                The board says that the finances are not available. If the
                Minister can make the finances available to the Department of
                Health, I am sure that the issue could be addressed directly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some 50 children in my area are waiting for
                special needs care. Children with learning difficulties and
                physical disabilities also require those benefits. I am
                concerned that the issue has not been addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Children suffer if finance is not made
                available. That falls back, and reflects badly, on the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the
                Department of Education and us, as elected representatives. We
                urge the Minister to ensure that sufficient finance is made
                available to ensure that children’s occupational therapy needs
                and language needs are looked after.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to apologise for something that is
                entirely my fault. I was in the Chair yesterday and am in it

                Supply motion yesterday, and we are doing the same with the
                Budget motion today. We have discussed all sorts of topics. It
                is not fair to the Minister to see his two objectives added
                together and adumbrated — several times in some cases. I

                Bearing in mind the Minister’s difficulties that you have
                highlighted, the House would be quite willing to give him a
                little time out so that he can separate his various
                responsibilities and bifurcate into Supply and Budget over

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will return at two&nbsp;o’clock.
                Minister, having dealt most effectively with Supply yesterday,
                can you pick a way through what is Supply and what is Budget and
                deal with the Budget today?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker, I welcome your
                observations. It saves me from making points that Members may
                feel are defensive, procedural pedantry. Nevertheless, the
                contributions, although perhaps not pertinent to the
                requirements of the Budget Bill, touch on the wider Budget
                considerations that Members feel are important to reflect upon.
                Given that latitude, and the spirit in which Members spoke, I
                will try to deal with some of the points raised, many of which
                were raised yesterday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the underlying recurrent theme
                yesterday, today and on previous occasions when I have been here
                — and there have been quite a few — for all the lack of
                accountability that Members refer to, I must say that I am doing
                very little in relation to finance. I am doing nothing without
                the authority and agreement of the Executive Committee. There is
                little beyond that which I am not presenting in the House. I am
                open to questions whenever we make statements. We are bringing
                those various measures together. I accept that we are in the
                difficult situation of having to take several procedural devices
                close together. It is hard in those circumstances for Members to
                tell precisely what is what, and there is a tendency in the
                debates for everything to get crammed in.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the concern about the lack of
                accountability and the talk about a lack of responsiveness, I
                will try to respond to many of the points. Today, 13 Members
                contributed. There were 21 contributions yesterday. Thinking
                back to the debate on the Budget, the contributions were in the
                high twenties, as they were for the debate on the draft Budget
                on the motion that was tabled by the Chairperson of the Finance
                and Personnel Committee, Mr Molloy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For all the criticism about the lack of
                consultation, there have been opportunities for Members to
                speak, without too many time constraints, on many of those
                issues. Many of the issues that have been raised today were also
                raised in previous debates. I have noted the points and have
                tried to respond on previous occasions, but they come back.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of rates and taxation was raised
                earlier by Dr Birnie, and I welcome that contribution. It chimes
                with points that I have made. Members need to think fully about
                the implications and the complications of the issues that are
                involved here. It is not just a matter of sloganeering our way
                through these problems. If we are serious about addressing the
                issues raised by the regional rate, then we must also be serious
                about pursuing the Barnett formula. We need to join up our
                thinking on all those points.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are going to make a case to the
                Treasury about Barnett, then we need to be aware that it will be
                countered with other points. In that regard, I would not be at
                all surprised to find some of the sweeping statements about
                wasteful, extravagant expenditure and the supposed lack of
                financial control on some programmes in Northern Ireland being
                read back to us in discussions with the Treasury. I ask Members
                to think more about all these issues, rather than make the
                assumption that, on any given day, the Department of Finance and
                Personnel has three wishes that it can ask for, and
                automatically receive, from the Treasury. We have to make a
                case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie and Mr Leslie, picking up on Mr
                Neeson’s argument, made the point that even the Barnett case
                is not straightforward. It is not even straightforward between
                the devolved territories. Therefore, we must take care to have a
                strong, well-developed case, and also to put it forward in a
                sound political context.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are to make the sort of cases that we
                have been told we need to make to the Treasury — not just on
                Barnett but also on UK fiscal measures, as Mr McCartney said —
                then let us be clear. If I were to take some of the main points
                raised here today and on previous occasions, I would be saying
                to the Treasury, &quot;We want more money for public
                expenditure. We are wasting the money that we are already
                getting. We do not want to raise any more money from our own
                households through the rates. We do not want to pay UK taxes. We
                want special exemptions from UK taxes and we want to be exempt
                from raising revenue of our own as well.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We would not survive very long in that
                conversation with the Treasury. I ask Members to listen with
                care to everything that has been said in the House. We will try
                to reflect, as an Executive, on all the positive contributions
                — and many positive contributions have been made. However, let
                us remember that all those points and contributions need to be
                read and considered in balance with each other. None of them can
                exist alone. If that is true of the world in general, it is
                certainly true in Government. Everything is connected to
                everything else. We cannot make our case on any of these issues
                on a purely free-standing basis. We need to make a case on most
                of those issues.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to the Minister for giving way.
                On the issue of rates, the amount that is being collected is
                minimal compared to the amounts that the Minister has found and
                where he could spend it. It is not an either/or situation.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will come to that point later, because
                issues were raised about the monitoring rounds and this notion
                of finding money wherever we find it.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People are rightly saying that I and the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, who have a
                particular representational role on behalf of the Executive and
                the broad regional interest, need to be making those cases to
                the UK Government and the Treasury in particular. We need to
                make those cases with care and consideration. We need to ensure
                — as I have already said — that we join up our thinking on
                those points.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Patricia Lewsley, Iris Robinson and others
                raised the question of funding for schools. To reiterate what I
                said yesterday, we obviously have to continue to invest in
                temporary school accommodation, even though the need is clearly
                for longer-term provision of adequate facilities. That is simply
                because there are longer-term issues that need to be addressed,
                and in the interim we need to make sure that there is, at least,
                acceptable accommodation. Those longer-term issues need to be
                addressed through the education budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One means of addressing some of those
                longer-term issues is through private finance initiatives (PFIs)
                and public-private partnerships. Given the limitations of our
                resources, we have to identify other means that can be
                marshalled to assist the public policy aim of having adequate
                schools capital facilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Patricia Lewsley and Paul Berry also
                mentioned the pursuit of value for money. The Executive are
                pursuing that agenda in several ways. That is also vital for
                this Assembly and, not least, for the Public Accounts Committee.
                We are developing public service agreements, and the importance
                of those was underlined by Esmond Birnie. We are trying to
                manage the transition to resource budgeting, and to ensure that
                we have proper appraisal procedures. We will pursue all of those
                rigorously. I hope that in doing so, we have the support not
                just of the House, but also of the respective departmental
                Committees. Those measures will be most telling as they apply,
                and are applied, at the departmental level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That brings me to a general point about the
                contributions today. Some Members seem to be under a
                misapprehension that I, as Minister of Finance and Personnel,
                have a directive role in relation to every bit of public
                expenditure that is discharged or managed by any Department or
                any agency. Members need to recognise that many of the very
                valid and useful points that have been raised today are
                particularly relevant when it comes to the departmental
                determinations, as far as spending priorities and spending
                allocations are concerned in departmental budgets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Minister of Finance and Personnel, I am in
                an unusual position. People tell me that I am interfering with
                what Departments want to do, that I am fussing around, that I am
                stopping Departments doing things and not affording people the
                flexibility or discretion that they need. It is alleged that the
                dead hand of the Department of Finance and Personnel is stopping
                and curtailing everything. At the same time I am told that the
                Department of Finance and Personnel is allowing Departments to
                do too much according to their own devices and whims.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reality is that we are presenting the
                broad Budget allocations for the different Departments and the
                different programmes. Decisions within those Budget lines are
                taken at departmental level. I hope that the departmental
                Committees are informing themselves of those decisions, are
                making their own concerns and interests felt, and advertising
                their own particular priorities that they want to see reflected
                in those allocations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the important roles of Committees
                have been stressed — not least the importance of scrutiny. The
                Committees also have policy development and priority informing
                roles. I do not believe that a Committee’s role should be
                confined to post hoc scrutiny. As Mr Dodds said, I hope that
                Committees will not feel constrained by the cycle of financial
                proceedings, and that they will still pursue those matters in
                their own time.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Questions have understandably been asked,
                notably by Mr Berry, about the criteria for the allocation of
                money. The process of public expenditure allocation is not one
                that lends itself to an easy formula for producing correct
                figures. Public expenditure is not managed on that basis
                anywhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must try to balance resources against
                needs. We must also constantly reappraise and test the
                allocation of resources against perceived needs, first to check
                whether needs have changed and should be recognised in a
                different way, and secondly to see whether opportunities to meet
                needs have changed and can be responded to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The change to resource accounting and
                budgeting should help with those matters. Spending plans should
                become a closer articulation of public policy priorities and
                public service interests than they have been in the past,
                because it is the focus on outcomes and outputs, not just on
                inputs, that helps us to make the change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice said that people wanted to see a
                comparison between this year’s allocations and last year’s.
                I believe that what people and the Assembly really want to know
                is whether money allocated for a particular purpose is really
                being used to the best effect for that purpose, or whether money
                could be released for other needs. We need to move away from
                treating budgets simply in terms of the incremental changes to
                inputs and start to examine the real uses to which money is put.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resource accounting and budgeting will help
                us to achieve value for money — a point that was made by
                several Members, including Ms Lewsley. That is because, with
                better information on the cost of services and a new focus on
                achieving objectives, there will be a renewed emphasis on the
                economy, efficiency and effectiveness of government. Those
                &quot;three Es&quot; will sit strongly and positively with the
                &quot;fourth E&quot; of equality, which we have a particular
                duty to have regard to since the agreement and the Northern
                Ireland Act 1998.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry raised points about the Health
                Service deficits. I have to agree with Mr Maskey on this, as Mr
                Berry seemed to make some contradictory claims. He began by
                presenting a picture of wasteful expenditure — some sort of
                management abandon — in particular in the trusts and ended up
                talking about the previous chronic underfunding of the Health
                Service. The Department of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety, the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister and the Department of Finance and Personnel are jointly
                consulting to look at the causes and the consequences of these
                trust deficits. They are serious issues and we recognise that
                they pose serious questions, not just about financial control
                but also about service delivery. Clearly there is a question
                about whether the trusts are underfunded, and whether that is
                then reflected in the deficits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, we have to address the serious
                issues of financial control. If the Assembly is to set budgets
                — and secondary allocations are made by the Departments based
                on those budgets — we have to ensure that everyone managing
                funds does so within the lines and limits of the set authority.
                The change to resource accounting and budgeting makes a
                difference here. Up to this point the spending of the trusts has
                been outside the departmental expenditure limit, and the
                deficits did not show up in the system for that reason. Under
                resource accounting and budgeting that will no longer be the
                case. Any emerging problems should show up early on and will be
                dealt with on that basis. The problem of cumulative trust
                deficits should not recur in the same way under resource
                accounting and budgeting. Other issues need to be addressed, and
                that is why we are consulting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already touched on the points raised
                about Barnett. The First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and
                I did make representations to the Chief Secretary to the
                Treasury in the last spending review. The real case that we need
                to make has to be in the context of the next spending review.
                Barnett and how UK fiscal measures affect Northern Ireland,
                which was raised by Mr McCartney, are matters that the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister continue to make
                representations to the Treasury on, as do other Ministers. Sir
                Reg Empey, as Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister have made several
                representations to the Treasury on the matter of fuel tax.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same applies to the climate change levy
                and to the aggregates tax. I, along with officials from several
                relevant Departments, met representatives of the Quarry Products
                Association. With further information from them we have been
                continuing to make that case. The First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister raised that matter in their last meeting with the
                Chancellor of the Exchequer. They pointed out — and we
                continue to do this — that some of these measures have an
                adverse effect, in economic terms, on Northern Ireland, for many
                of the reasons that Mr McCartney gave. Some, which are meant to
                be environmental measures, obviously have a perverse effect on
                Northern Ireland. They do not achieve their environmental aims
                and compound our economic disadvantage in other areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie and Mr O’Connor raised an issue
                with regard to housing. The Department for Social Development
                and the Housing Executive have jointly commissioned a strategic
                options study, which is examining options for the future
                financing of social housing. My Department has been consulted
                and I hope that we can look forward to a presentation in due
                course.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I dealt with Mr Neeson’s question about the
                gas industry yesterday. We recognise the importance of the Port
                of Belfast, and the Department for Regional Development is
                addressing that issue. The Regional Development Committee has
                also been looking at the matter and has been considering
                options.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have pointed out some considerations that
                people will need to have regard to if we are to make diligent
                decisions. Some are not of our making, or of our choosing.
                Nevertheless, they are there and, in the realistic public
                interest, we need to bear them in mind.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Points were made in relation to railways, and
                some railway lines in particular. Again, I covered most of those
                yesterday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fraud issues — including those raised
                concerning the Department of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety — are taken seriously. I have underlined that before. I
                hope Ministers take all incidents of fraud, and all
                possibilities for fraud, seriously. The Minister of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety takes the issue of fraud
                seriously — be it at the level of service users or
                practitioners. Measures have already been announced and
                undertaken in relation to several aspects of health and social
                services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already dealt with schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were some issues raised concerning gap
                funding. I had hoped that I had dealt with some of those
                yesterday. Nevertheless — in case there are any outstanding
                issues or concerns — I will repeat what I said. Last week, I
                announced that part of the December monitoring round involved
                setting money aside to cover Departments in starting to make
                allocations to groups that they believe — on the basis of a
                sound judgement — would be eligible for Peace II funding. The
                moneys being allocated to the Executive programme funds for
                social inclusion are there as a safety net, in the event that
                Departments make allocations to groups or projects that do not
                qualify for Peace II funding. The Departments will be covered
                against that, as will the peace fund. This is something more
                than the previous forms of gap funding. We are now starting to
                look at making allocations on the basis of the criteria for
                Peace II. There are no guarantees, and sustainability criteria
                were written in for all groups to have regard to at the start of
                Peace I. They were also underlined in an interim report in 1997.
                The different funding agencies and bodies have had to have
                regard to sustainability. It is not just a matter for the
                Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members may want to consider that, looking at
                the funding for Peace II — and at the issues of
                sustainability, which are obviously going to arise at the end of
                Peace II — developing the type of arrangement we have created
                with the Executive Programme Funds gives us one means of trying
                to pick up on those issues. It also enables us to mainstream —
                as we have been requested to do by Ms Morrice and others. I hope
                therefore that people will give some long-term thought to what
                we are trying to achieve with the facilities provided by the
                Executive programme funds. Given that the significant additional
                money that we receive from Peace II will be lost in some years’
                time — and we are aware of the important programmes that it
                supports —the Assembly will have to question its attitude to
                raising additional resources through the rates. I do not know
                how we are meant to meet that loss in the future if we forego
                the option of raising additional money through rates.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have covered most of the new points made
                today. Obviously, I will endeavour to write to Members on any
                matters that I have not been able to cover. For instance,
                Jim&nbsp;Shannon made a point about roads at the end of the
                debate, which was covered yesterday. The spending decisions
                relating to many of those points cannot be determined by the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel — they need to be addressed
                and answered by the relevant Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have had regard to the procedural issues
                raised. Jane&nbsp;Morrice wanted to know if the Estimates were
                going to be provided hand-in-hand with the Budget Bill. If
                anything, I thought that most Members were making the opposite
                criticism: that the Estimates and the Budget Bill are too close
                together. Perhaps that is one of the reasons for the confusion
                about which channel we are meant to be in at a particular time.
                In future, I hope that we can ensure that the Estimates are
                available a bit earlier so that Members can give them proper
                consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, allow me to stress that the
                allocation made for the deficits came out of the December
                monitoring round, even though it has had to be reflected in the
                spring Supplementary Estimates. Given that they had to be
                updated with such an adjustment, the spring Supplementary
                Estimates were turned around in very good time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reiterate that we will work with the
                Committees on improving the cycle to ensure that there is time
                for fuller consideration and greater contribution. Contributions
                do not always have to take the form of post hoc scrutiny by
                Committees, and that does not just apply to the Committee of
                Finance and Personnel; it applies to the other departmental
                Committees too. I hope that we can achieve better spacing
                between the Estimates and the Budget Bill and that that will
                allow for full and proper consideration of the Estimates. This
                should also free the Budget Bill from some of the confusion that
                has beset it this morning.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This group of amendments is largely technical
                and represents the tidying-up of the way in which the Bill will
                set the framework for subsequent Budget Bills.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The starting point is that the control system
                up to now, based on cash control, has involved money being voted
                to services structured in a series of votes. The money available
                through a vote can be spent only on services within the ambit of
                the vote, and the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG)
                will subsequently view expenditure on activities outside the
                ambit as irregular and not properly chargeable to the vote. That
                would then trigger qualification of the accounts and, if
                necessary, questions from the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).
                This is a central aspect of the Assembly’s control of
                spending.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the introduction of resource accounting
                and budgeting, there is a need for a shift of emphasis from
                control on the basis of cash to resources. The proposal is that
                cash should be allocated and controlled at departmental level
                but that the Assembly’s control of spending at service level
                should be preserved by a requirement that resources are used
                only within the ambit of the relevant request for resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus amendments 1, 3 and 4 provide for future
                Budget Bills to appropriate cash at departmental level, and they
                remove the requirements to identify cash drawdowns from the
                Consolidated Fund at a lower level. I stress that the raising of
                the level at which this control applies will be balanced by a
                new control on the use of resources at service level by
                Departments. I will say more about that later in relation to
                amendments 7 and 8.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendments 2 and 5 represent the simple
                tidying-up of terminology in the Bill — the removal of
                incorrect references to &quot;subsection&quot; and their
                replacement with &quot;section&quot; — and do not effect any
                change in its scope or its purpose.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendments 6, 14 and 18 simply replace the
                reference to &quot;Appropriation Act&quot; with the reference to
                &quot;Budget Act&quot; in order to reflect the change in title
                of the legislation referred to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendments 9 to 13 deal with the simple
                change in terminology. Up to now, within limits defined in the
                Estimates, cash received by Departments could be used by them in
                addition to that directly appropriated by the Assembly. The term
                &quot;appropriation in aid&quot; has been applied to this
                concept. However, in future, such sums will be considered on an
                accruals basis and will be used to supplement resources
                authorised by the Assembly. Thus, the term &quot;appropriation
                in aid&quot; will be inappropriate and consequently will be
                replaced by &quot;accruing resources&quot;.</p>

                appropriated by Assembly legislation. Those powers are provided
                under the Northern Ireland Act&nbsp;1998 but do not extend to
                non-cash-based resources. The Government Resources and Accounts
                Bill is being amended to provide the Assembly with the same
                powers in relation to the resources that are not cash-based as
                it already has for sums of money.</p>

                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These amendments are a direct consequence of
                the transition to resource accounting and budgeting, and they
                are the most significant to be considered today. They will put
                in place a statutory basis for the control of resources by the
                Assembly, together with an associated fail-safe mechanism in the
                event that the Assembly fail to authorise the use of resources
                for any year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I previously mentioned the raising of the
                level at which the control of cash will apply. Amendment&nbsp;7
                balances that higher level of cash control by introducing in
                subsection (1) a control on the use of resources by Departments.
                That is a more stringent control than the previous cash-based
                approach, since it is possible that resources can be consumed
                without the use of cash.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In effect, this bases the control on
                departmental activity rather than on spend. I propose that the
                interpretation and application of this requirement should be the
                subject of discussion with the Assembly and especially with the
                Finance and Personnel Committee over the next few months.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the Vote on Account the structure of the
                distribution of resources has been set at broadly the same level
                as in the former cash vote structure. That preserves the
                Assembly’s control in that Departments are unable to spend
                more on a particular set of purposes than the Main Estimates
                provision without seeking a Supplementary Estimate. However, I
                want to provide an opportunity for the structure of the new
                resource Estimates to be discussed more fully. We should take
                the opportunity to satisfy ourselves that we have a practicable
                and acceptable structure that helps to show the relationship
                between the objectives for each request for resources. This work
                should be tied closely to our work on public service agreements
                and should help us to develop a better and more transparent
                financial planning system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It could be argued that it is not necessary
                to introduce powers with regard to the authorisation of
                resources for use by Departments, leaving the Department of
                Finance and Personnel to bring forward resource-based Estimates
                as a matter of policy and convention. That is, in effect, the
                position in Westminster. The Government Resources and Accounts
                Act 2000 has no provision corresponding to that. However, the
                Executive have decided that this fundamental aspect of control
                by the Assembly should be firmly and specifically embodied in
                statute. It is important to note, however, that the new control
                should apply only to specific expenditure in the scope of the
                resource budgeting envelope.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consequently, there is a need to provide for
                some exceptions. That is the purpose of subsection&nbsp;(2). It
                is no different from the position under the previous cash regime
                when the funds mentioned were outside the cash control.
                Subsection&nbsp;(3) is a reference to amendment&nbsp;8, which I
                will turn to shortly. Subsection (4) simply defines the
                Departments and bodies to which this new control applies as
                those bodies for which an Estimate is approved. They are
                currently the main Departments — the Northern Ireland Audit
                Office, the Office for the Regulation of Electricity and Gas (OFREG),
                the Assembly Ombudsman for Northern&nbsp;Ireland and the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland Assembly. Amendment&nbsp;7 will have the
                effect of making actions by Departments that commit resources
                subject to authorisation by the Assembly. That will apply even
                if they do not immediately require cash.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Making a commitment to a contractor would be
                immediately recognised in the accounts of the Department. Under
                resource accounting and budgeting, that would have to be within
                the constraints set by the relevant Budget Bill. Therefore,
                amendment&nbsp;8 contains a fail-safe mechanism, which parallels
                that in section&nbsp;59 of the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Act 1998 to
                allow for the possibility that the Assembly might not approve a
                Budget Bill in time. Section&nbsp;59 relates only to cash
                control. The creation of this safety net is a prudent but, it is
                hoped, redundant step in respect of public expenditure. I
                emphasise that it is the responsibility of all Members to ensure
                that this provision remains redundant. However, if it does not,
                for whatever reason, the mechanism is essential in that it will
                ensure the continuity of public services in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that Members will readily acknowledge
                that we could not tolerate a situation where the absence of
                authority for Departments to act would mean a break, however
                brief, in the provision of essential public services, which
                include vital protections for us all and include meeting the
                needs of the most disadvantaged in the community.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the first Consideration Stage of this
                Bill last week, I advised the House that if my amendment
                relating to this clause was successful, I would move a further
                amendment this week to effect the necessary changes. I was aware
                that some tidying was needed in the drafting. In the subsequent
                period, I consulted with rather more skilled draftsmen than
                myself, and consequently the amendment should take care of the
                outstanding issues. The effect of the amendment will not be in
                any way to reduce the extra power of</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the group of persons for the time being
                selected by the Treasury&quot; ,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">which was the thrust of the amendment last
                week. The substance of the matter there is that the Department
                shall take account of all recommendations — that remains
                intact.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members may note that the word
                &quot;full&quot;, which was in the amendment last week, is being
                deleted. The reasoning is that there is no distinction in
                drafting between &quot;account&quot; and &quot;full
                account&quot;. Taking account is taking account, and therefore
                there is no need for the word &quot;full&quot;. It is
                superfluous, and I have therefore removed it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The words &quot;consult with and take&quot;
                are suggested in order to ensure that clause 18(1) corresponds
                with clause 18(2), which uses the words</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;where a group is consulted under
                subsection (1)&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is required to ensure consistency of
                language, but in doing so it does not in any way take away from
                the powers reserved to this group by the amendment last week.
                Therefore this amendment does the necessary tidying up in the
                drafting but preserves the import of the amendment that we
                passed at the Consideration Stage. I trust that the House will
                support this amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to address a few remarks to amendment
                17, standing in the name of Mr Dodds. I will not pre-empt Mr
                Dodds’s own remarks, but I want to focus on the significance
                of &quot;substantially&quot; in the clause at line 26. Members
                should recall that this entire clause was inserted at the behest
                of the Public Accounts Committee and supported by the Finance
                and Personnel Committee. The Comptroller and Auditor General was
                also satisfied with it when consulted. I was very happy that
                this clause was passed last week, as I felt it added
                considerably to our ability to keep a check on where public
                money was going.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question posed by the amendment is
                whether the Comptroller and Auditor General can properly survey
                all the relevant money. I invite the Minister to dwell on what
                he considers the words &quot;substantially funded from public
                money&quot; to mean. It is possible that the wording of the
                clause will, in practice, cover the wording proposed in the
                amendment, but that is a matter, to some extent, of
                interpretation. I hope that the Minister will enlighten the
                House when he addresses this clause.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.
                Before addressing the Committee’s amendment (No 16), I want to
                comment on amendment 15, which relates to Mr Leslie’s new
                clause 18, adopted by the Assembly at the Consideration Stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This clause introduces the requirement to
                have a body to oversee the issuing of guidance by the Department
                of Finance and Personnel to other Government Departments. It has
                been argued that Mr Leslie’s amendment was flawed because it
                assumed that the Department of Finance and Personnel would
                consult with the new body. This perceived weakness has been
                corrected in the amendment that has been proposed by Mr Leslie
                and which the Committee supports.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding the Committee’s amendment 16,
                Members will recall that the Assembly adopted an earlier
                amendment intended to lift restrictions on the Comptroller and
                Auditor General and his access to documents during an audit
                investigation. The Minister has kindly pointed out that there is
                now a contradiction between the Comptroller and Auditor General’s
                access powers when pursuing an audit and when undertaking an
                inspection under the new clause 20. I thank the Minister for
                drawing that to the Committee’s attention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of the amendment is to ensure
                that the Comptroller and Auditor General has unrestricted powers
                of access when undertaking an inspection of the accounts of any
                body covered by clause 20. The Committee concluded that it was
                particularly important that the Comptroller and Auditor General
                should not be subjected to inappropriate delay when inspecting
                the accounts of bodies that are remote from the core Civil
                Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I want to comment briefly on
                amendment 17, which stands in the name of Mr Dodds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At Consideration Stage, the additional
                wording proposed by Mr Dodds was first included in the Committee’s
                original amendment to extend the C&amp;AG’s powers of
                inspection. The Committee accepted the Minister’s amendment to
                extend the powers of the C&amp;AG to investigate bodies
                receiving public funds. However, the Committee made it clear
                that the amendment did not go as far as Members wished in order
                to ensure full public accountability of how public money is used
                by all bodies that receive significant public funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We welcomed the additional amendments made by
                the Minister to strengthen the C&amp;AG’s power to inspect in
                advance of the Sharman Report on the audit and accountability of
                public money. The Sharman Report has now been published and will
                be considered by the Committee. I am sure that we will endorse
                many of its findings and recommendations. We will pursue them
                vigorously in collaboration with the Audit Committee and the
                Public Accounts Committee when the audit reorganisation Bill
                arrives in the autumn.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has not considered Mr Dodds
                amendment formally and has not formed a view on it. I would
                welcome an indication from the Minister that he will take the
                Sharman Report into account when dealing with the audit
                reorganisation Bill later this year.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards amendment 17, the issue concerning
                the Comptroller and Auditor General’s powers of inspection has
                had more than a fair airing in the Finance and Personnel
                Committee and in the House during the Consideration Stage last
                week.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is fair to say that during consideration
                by the Finance Committee, the Public Accounts Committee, the
                Audit Committee and the Assembly, the Minister has taken on
                board some of our concerns relating to the inadequacy of the
                G&amp;AG’s powers of inspection in respect of private,
                non-governmental bodies that may be in receipt of public funds.
                He has moved some way on that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, concern still exists, and it has
                been reinforced by the publication of the Sharman Report. This
                necessitates our coming back to this issue and looking at it in
                more detail. I will be interested to hear the Minister’s
                definition of these words in clause 20(3)(b):</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the body exercises functions of a
                public nature or is entirely or substantially funded from public
                money.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To put that into context, we are talking
                about the ability of the C&amp;AG to follow public money, to
                inspect how a government body, a non-governmental organisation,
                a private body or a community organisation spends public money.
                It is a fundamental principle that we are all agreed on. The
                question is: how do we approach it? The Minister has suggested
                that clause 20(3)(b) is not the most appropriate way to deal
                with it, and has suggested to the Committee that we leave it to
                be dealt with by another piece of legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the principle is that wherever
                public money is granted, allocated or appropriated, the C&amp;AG
                should have a responsibility to follow that money, to inspect
                how it is spent, to ensure that it is spent in accordance with
                the wishes of the Assembly and in accordance with the purposes
                for which it was allocated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very important that, when considering
                this legislation, we give the C&amp;AG the power to follow
                public money. We are looking at powers of inspection, not powers
                of audit. We are talking about the right to inspect; we are not
                talking about giving the C&amp;AG wholesale power to audit
                private organisations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have now had the benefit of seeing the
                report made by Lord Sharman. It is a detailed report, and the
                Finance and Personnel Committee will be looking at it in some
                detail. The Sharman review of audit accountability was
                established to examine current audit and accountability
                arrangements for central government and to make recommendations.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In page 13 of the report Lord Sharman says,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Many private sector organisations
                receive grants and subsidy from central Government bodies. In
                law, money given as grant ceases to be public money when it is
                paid to the recipient. However, it is generally recognised that
                there is a need for public accountability for such monies, to
                ensure that they are being spent properly and value for money is
                achieved.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can all heartily agree with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lord Sharman goes on to give examples of
                arrangements for access in other countries by their equivalent
                of the Comptroller and Auditor General and by national audit
                offices. He points out that there are arrangements in other
                countries to allow auditors to inspect how public funds have
                been used. For instance, in France all private bodies that
                receive money from public funds can be examined by the
                appropriate body. Where public funds exceed 50% of turnover, all
                the funds can be examined. In Germany, the appropriate body is
                able to examine the financial management of private entities
                that receive grants or guarantees. In Denmark, a similar
                statutory right of access to bodies — private or otherwise —
                that receive grants is available, and similarly in Holland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw attention to the Sharman Report
                because it backs up the points that have been made by many of us
                concerning the need to ensure that the Comptroller and Auditor
                General has the necessary powers. He himself admitted, when he
                gave evidence to the Committee, that the original draft of the
                legislation was not going to give him those powers. The famous
                example is that of the football club because that happened to
                coincide with an announcement by the Minister of grant moneys.
                Certain football clubs, as private organisations, were going to
                be in receipt of substantial public funds. Under current law —
                and as originally drafted — the Comptroller and Auditor
                General would not have the right of inspection to see that that
                public money was being spent in the way that it should be. That
                is clearly a loophole, and it needs to be closed. I have tabled
                an amendment that will address that. At the Consideration Stage

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;entirely or substantially funded from
                public money&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">was inserted into the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will listen carefully to the Minister, but
                it is important that at the earliest opportunity we, as an
                Assembly, insert in legislation the right of the Comptroller and
                Auditor General to inspect the accounts of any organisation in
                receipt of significant public funds. The right to follow that
                money is all-important, and we must ensure that that right is
                not fettered in any way.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support all three amendments. I do not know
                whether the proposers of the amendments will be happy about this
                or whether they will regard it as the kiss of death.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will deal first with the two least
                controversial amendments. Mr Leslie’s amendment was certainly
                a very good step forward, and it was accepted. It had the power
                to tighten up the independence of the advisory body and to
                ensure that the Department of Finance and Personnel takes
                account of that body. Mr Leslie’s amendment today keeps within
                the spirit and the letter of his previous one, but tightens up
                the wording to ensure that it is compatible with the rest of the
                clause. It is a worthwhile amendment, and there should be no
                controversy about it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similarly, the amendment in the name of the
                Committee to remove the words &quot;at a reasonable time&quot;
                was established last week as a principle in another clause, but
                makes it compatible with the provisions of the Bill. A test of
                reasonableness will be applied by the courts in any case, but
                that need not be explicitly included in the Bill. This amendment
                would make the Bill consistent and bring it into line with what
                was proposed at Consideration Stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There may be great division on Mr Dodds’s
                amendment. I welcome the changes proposed by the Minister last
                week because they moved much closer to addressing some of the
                concerns raised. At that stage, I said that I was looking for an
                amendment to further tighten control, and this amendment does
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a general principle, it is important that
                the Comptroller and Auditor General should have inspection
                powers to allow him to follow public money. At the outset, it
                should be noted that we are talking about inspection powers
                rather than audit powers. I do not, therefore, believe that the
                powers impose too great a burden on non-governmental bodies.
                They fulfil the key principle that one must be able to follow
                Government money. It is an important check and balance to ensure
                that public money, which is voted through by the Assembly, is
                not abused in any way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key question posed by both Mr Leslie and
                Mr Dodds is the definition of the terms &quot;substantially
                funded&quot; and &quot;receipt of significant public
                funds&quot;. I am keen to hear the Minister’s comments on this
                matter, but it strikes me that there is a clear and qualitative
                difference between those two phrases — they cannot be
                compatible. The wording encompasses a body that is entirely
                funded from public funds — that meaning is clear to everyone
                — yet it also encompasses a body that is &quot;substantially
                funded&quot; from the public purse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The term &quot;substantially funded&quot;
                refers to the proportion or percentage of a body’s finances
                that are derived from the public purse. For example, a voluntary
                group might have an annual budget of £50,000, of which £40,000
                comes from the public purse. That represents about 80% of its
                budget and, consequently, there can be no argument that it is
                not &quot;substantially funded&quot; from the public purse. In
                contrast, the phrase &quot;in receipt of significant public
                funds&quot;, when used to describe a group that has received
                public funds, refers to the quantity of money involved rather
                than to the percentage of public money received. Therefore, one
                could have a private body that has an annual budget of £10
                million, of which £1 million comes from the public purse. That
                is a significant amount of money, yet it represents just 10% of
                the body’s budget. It is arguable that the body could not be
                described as one which is &quot;substantially funded&quot; from
                the public purse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be a ridiculous situation if bodies
                receiving large amounts of public money were to fall outside the
                remit of the Bill because of the percentage of turnover a grant
                represented, while small groups that are entirely funded from
                the public purse were subject to inspection. If we are to avoid
                the abuse of public finances, we need to cover both situations
                — a body that is entirely or substantially funded from the
                public purse and a body that is receiving significant funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the amendment were accepted it would cover
                both those situations and ensure that public funds are properly
                spent. The Minister could question the exact meaning of
                &quot;significant funding&quot;, yet the definition of
                &quot;substantially funded&quot; could also be queried because
                the percentage of a body’s finances referred to is unclear.
                Clearly, the two terms have different meanings — one refers to
                proportion, and the other to amount. These matters should be
                decided by a test of reasonableness applied by the Comptroller
                and Auditor General.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment adds to the strength of the
                Comptroller and Auditor General, but, what is most important, it
                enshrines the key principles that public money should be
                allocated properly and that there should be redress by way of
                inspection. This amendment, as the other two, is worthy of the
                Assembly’s support.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Audit Committee (Mr
                Dallat):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I oppose the amendment put forward by Mr
                Dodds, not because of the principle behind it, but because of
                the recent publication of the Sharman Report. It is necessary
                for the Audit Committee, the Public Accounts Committee and, no
                doubt, the Finance and Personnel Committee to study the report
                in order to bring accountability of the public auditor forward
                to the next stage. There is, of course, the audit reorganisation
                Bill which has to be considered in the future as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should also bear in mind that we have an
                undertaking from the Minister to co-operate with the three
                Chairpersons. He has given us assurances that he will give
                serious consideration to the issues that were raised today by Mr
                Dodds. I welcome that, and support any extended powers that will
                give greater accountability without having an adverse effect on
                people who apply for public money, particularly for the
                community projects referred to. I am worried that if we pass the
                amendment in the name of Mr Dodds at this time, without due
                consideration, we may create the very opposite of what we all
                wish to achieve, which is to ensure that money actually gets to
                the people who need it most. In no way do I question his
                sincerity in matters relating to audit issues. Indeed, I thank
                him for his support this morning when he added his voice of
                concern to my worries about the procurement procedures and
                conflict of interest issues involving the Northern Ireland
                Tourist Board, contained in last week’s audit report. I want
                to hear more Members speaking out, particularly those who have
                taken public accounts as a specialist subject.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Chairman of the Audit Committee, I wish to
                put on record my gratitude for the remarkable degree of
                co-operation between the Finance and Personnel Committee, the
                Public Accounts Committee and the Audit Committee. I wish to put
                on record my appreciation of the Minister’s desire to
                encourage an open approach to financial accountability. The
                relationships within the Public Accounts Committee and the Audit
                Committee are a model for other Committees to emulate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential that we maintain that
                partnership because there is no doubt that this is the way
                forward if we are to address the undesirable practices that have
                crept into Departments and other agencies that spend money on
                behalf of the Government. I am sure that real progress has been
                made in the whole field of public accountability. The public are
                watching very carefully how we bring that forward in a managed
                way. At long last, after 30 years of non-accountability, there
                is a new awareness that this Assembly is beginning to create
                change, and nowhere is this more evident than in the field of
                finance and public expenditure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is critical that we continue to sing from
                the same hymn sheet and deliver real change, rather than aspire
                to change. This Bill, as amended, gives us the scope required to
                begin the process of extending powers of scrutiny. From that
                secure base, we can take the process forward, bearing in mind
                that the Minister has given us an undertaking that he will
                consider further powers for the public auditor.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should wait until we have considered the
                Sharman Report before considering the amendment put forward by
                Mr Dodds, because we do not want to do anything that would
                discourage those in greatest need from applying for public
                funds. Apart from that, I have no fundamental disagreement with
                it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am happy to follow the remarks made by Mr
                Weir. He put his finger on the key issue, and I will follow on
                from his speech in a moment. I am not so happy to follow Mr
                Dallat, who seems to have an identity crisis that we need to
                resolve. He stood up, purporting to be acting as Chairman of the
                Audit Committee. Those were his very first words, as the
                Official Report will show. He then said that he was opposing the
                amendment in the name of Mr Dodds. I will be interested to hear
                of the decision of the Audit Committee to take such a position.
                As he was speaking in his capacity as Chairman, it is a strange
                position to adopt. Even more strange <i>— [Interruption]</i>.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was simply making a plea for an opportunity
                for my Committee to discuss the Sharman Report and then perhaps
                take on board everything that has been said.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.45 pm</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The record will show very clearly that Mr
                Dallat stood up, purporting to speak as Chairman of the Audit
                Committee, and said that he opposed my Colleague’s amendment.
                Mr Dallat is shaking his head, so he obviously does not even
                remember what he said a few moments ago. His justification for
                that position was even wilder — he said that he was opposing
                it because of the Sharman Report. I do not know whether he has
                read the Sharman report, but he certainly could not have
                understood it, because that report justifies the position that
                we have adopted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that the author of the briefing
                note for the Committee will not mind if I quote from it:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It is also interesting, in light of
                discussions in the Finance and Personnel Committee, that Sharman
                has accepted the case for public sector audit access to any
                grant receiving body. This would fully cover the football club
                example which was of concern to some members of the DFP
                Committee.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Sharman Report is therefore a
                justification for our amendment rather than a reason for
                opposing it. That means either that the Member was being
                mischievous in simply attempting to support his party Colleague,
                the Minister, or that he did not understand the Sharman Report,
                or simply that he did not read it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that the Sharman Report goes
                further than the proposed legislation. It seeks to create
                broader rights of access than those allowed under the
                legislation. Therefore, we cite the Sharman report as evidence
                in support of our amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference to the football analogy was made in
                the briefing note. It may be worthwhile to outline this analogy
                for Members who are not familiar with it. It just so happened
                that on one of the days on which the Finance and Personnel
                Committee met to discuss this matter, the Culture, Arts and
                Leisure Minister made a statement to the Assembly about funding
                for football clubs in Northern Ireland. He said that the funds
                would be distributed among several clubs, but that, as a
                pre-requisite to drawing down the Government grant, each club
                would have to cover 25% of development costs from its own funds.
                This was a reasonable and sensible proposal on the part of the
                Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Minister then said that two
                football clubs were unable to take up the funding, because they
                could not cover 25% of the costs of the development work.
                Several football clubs may have on their boards of directors a
                building contractor who, it is suggested, could quote a higher
                price for work and then give the club a 25% discount. That would
                mean the Government paying the whole sum. The Minister, from his
                standpoint, was not able to involve himself in that degree of
                detail. However, if the Comptroller and Auditor General were
                able to follow money right down to the point where it was
                actually spent, he could make sufficient enquiries to gauge
                whether the Government were paying 100% or 75% of the money
                actually spent on development work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Initially, the Comptroller and Auditor
                General said that he was satisfied with the wording of the
                legislation proposed by the Minister. However, when this
                football analogy was presented to him during the Finance and
                Personnel’s evidence session, he recognised that he had not
                taken account of that set of circumstances and that the
                situation could be guarded against by implementing a proposal
                such as the one which is contained in our amendment. That is
                merely an example of one set of circumstances, but since then I
                have been able to let my imagination stretch to many other cases
                in which the Comptroller and Auditor General would not be able
                to follow the pounds to check that they were being spent in the
                way in which the Assembly, or a Department, intended.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must not pass this legislation only to
                have to come back to it, as will be the case. One day we will
                read in the headlines of ‘The Belfast Telegraph’ that money
                voted by the Assembly has been used for the wrong purpose or in
                some way that was not intended.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And we will all throw our hands up and say
                &quot;This is terrible. We must do something about it.&quot; I
                contend that we can do something about it now by giving powers
                to the Comptroller and Auditor General that will allow him free
                access to follow the pounds that are voted by the Assembly, no
                matter where they go. We have specified a significant amount of
                money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We now come to the issue that was raised by
                the Member for North Down. If we simply say, as the legislation
                does, that the body in question exercises functions of a public
                nature, or is entirely or substantially funded from public
                money, the body’s annual accounts will show that a substantial
                proportion of its funding comes directly from Government
                sources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, if it is a one-off grant, the body
                will not be classified under this legislation as substantially
                funded from Government sources. The grant might be a substantial
                amount in one financial year. There might also be an argument
                about whether substantial funding is for both revenue and
                capital spending. Under our amendment, if passed, if a
                significant amount of money is given even on a one-off basis by
                the Department, the Department will be significantly funding
                that body in that one year, and the Comptroller and Auditor
                General will have the power to pursue the money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will mention another factor. To a community
                organisation in east Belfast, £10,000 might be a substantial
                amount of money — in fact it might be enough to run the show
                for a year. However, to a larger organisation, a grant of
                £10,000 might amount to a very small part of its funding. Are
                we saying that it is not the amount of money we vote through
                this Assembly nor the amount allocated by a Department to a body
                that matters? Are we saying that it is the scale of the body
                that determines whether the Comptroller and Auditor General
                should pursue it? That is the gist of the legislation that is
                being proposed today: the size of the organisation and its
                budget will determine whether an amount of money is substantial
                or not. That is entirely wrong. If the amount is significant of
                itself, it should not matter what proportion of the overall
                expenditure or funding of the organisation it may constitute.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore for all of those reasons I support
                the amendment in the name of my Colleague. I believe that it is
                in line with what Sharman would wish us to do. Indeed, it may be
                that he took his lead from the Finance and Personnel Committee
                and decided that it was necessary to have his report toughened
                up to deal with this set of circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Minister will not want to
                push a piece of legislation through the Assembly because he has
                gone firm on it, or simply for the sake of it. I hope that he is
                prepared to recognise that Sharman wants the toughest possible
                role for the Comptroller and Auditor General to enable the man
                to see what is going on. I trust that the Minister will not try
                to curtail this amendment for the sake of holding on to his own
                piece of legislation and attempting to get it through the House
                unscathed. I regret very much the action taken by the
                Chairperson of the Audit Committee on his own behalf; I suspect
                that his Committee has not come to that conclusion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Three amendments have been addressed in this
                group, and I intend to deal with each of them in turn.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept the amendment tabled by Mr Leslie.
                It removes a technical deficiency to the amendment that was
                passed at Consideration Stage, and it is acceptable to the
                Executive. The insertion of the requirement to consult makes
                good the technical deficiency that I pointed out in the Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to note that Mr Leslie now
                accepts that to &quot;take full account&quot;, as in his
                original amendment, would essentially have been unworkable
                because it was impossible to define. A reference to &quot;having
                regard to&quot;, which is the formulation used elsewhere in the
                Bill, could have been used, but the Executive consider that
                &quot;take account of&quot; is acceptable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In light of earlier comments, I stress that
                it was always my intention that the independent views of the
                Financial Reporting Advisory Board (FRAB) should genuinely
                influence and inform the Department of Finance and Personnel on
                accounting matters. Some Members have pointed out that this was
                not covered in the original Bill. However, I did address it at
                the Second Stage of the Bill and said that I wanted views from
                relevant Committees on how that independent advice could best be
                provided. The advice was that it should come from FRAB, and that
                has been accommodated. It is important to underline that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am disappointed that there is a perception
                that some issues need to be made more explicit. However, I
                accept the Assembly’s view. I am satisfied that my original
                purpose has been served and that the Department of Finance and
                Personnel should consult with an independent, expert body before
                issuing formal directions on accounting matters. Subject to the
                addition of three words, the clause now stands as I originally
                submitted it to the Finance and Personnel Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Committee for its deliberations
                and thoroughness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept amendment 16 tabled by the
                Chairperson of the Finance and Personnel Committee, Francie
                Molloy. As I said during the Consideration Stage of the Bill,
                the Wednesbury test of reasonableness will apply in any case.
                The work of the Comptroller and Auditor General will not be made
                any more effective by the deletion of the words &quot;at any
                reasonable time&quot;. In case there is any misunderstanding, I
                stress that the test of reasonableness and arbitration on what
                is reasonable time never lay with the Department of Finance and
                Personnel. The Wednesbury test clearly falls to the Comptroller
                and Auditor General; the Department of Finance and Personnel is
                not the arbiter, contrary to the impression that some Members
                have given. The amendment is technical and makes the wording in
                the Bill consistent, as Francie Molloy and I have pointed out.
                Again, I thank the Chairperson and his Colleagues on the Finance
                and Personnel Committee for their careful and persistent work in
                the scrutiny of this Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendment 17 raises several points, and
                several Members have spoken on it. One of the points concerns
                the stress laid on ensuring public accountability, something we
                would all like to see. Questions have been asked on how the
                Executive intend to achieve this. The main way to ensure
                accountability is for each Department to put in place and to
                operate effective conditions for grants and for checks to be
                made on how these are being spent. There seems to be a
                misapprehension that, once allocations have been made, the
                Comptroller and Auditor General is the only person who has the
                power to check on how moneys are being spent and if they are
                being spent on the purposes for which they were intended.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to underline the duties and
                functions that Departments have in that regard and not simply to
                say that it is entirely up to the Comptroller and Auditor
                General to find those things out. Due diligence and proper
                management by Departments needs to be followed through. I hope
                that all the departmental Committees take an interest in that.
                In opposing amendment 17, I point out that the amendment
                accepted from me last week secures access for the Comptroller
                and Auditor General to all bodies substantially funded from
                public funds. The question of what that means has been raised.
                It means 50% or more. Many bodies receive significant funds well
                below 50%. In an urgent or particular case, the Comptroller and
                Auditor General can be given access by order of the Department
                of Finance and Personnel, which I will deal with later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now wish to raise some further points on
                the amendment. It is an important principle that those who are
                governed clearly understand the circumstances in which they will
                be held to account. Those who exercise functions of regulation
                should not be provided with unfettered discretion unless that is
                absolutely necessary. As the term &quot;significant&quot; is not
                defined, the proposed amendment could allow the Comptroller and
                Auditor General full access to the documents, books and records
                of virtually all organisations that do business with Government.
                If amendment 17 is made, the consequences may inhibit people who
                might otherwise participate through work with voluntary sector
                organisations. If the Comptroller and Auditor General — <i>[Interruption].</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that the term
                &quot;significant&quot; is not defined. Apart from the verbal
                assurance that the Minister has given that
                &quot;substantial&quot; means above 50%, can the Minister say
                where &quot;substantially&quot; is defined in the Bill?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will continue with the point I was going to
                make. I was asked to state what &quot;substantial&quot; means,
                and I said that it means 50% or more. I also said, on the basis
                of the amendments already adopted, that the Comptroller and
                Auditor General’s access is not unnecessarily restricted. It
                is fairly clear that it is only restricted where funding is
                above that level.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is very disrespectful of the Minister.
                He really should behave in a way more becoming to his Office. He
                raises an issue of some importance, yet the legislation does not
                contain the words that he has uttered in the House. Therefore,
                the Assembly has the right to probe him so that in any case that
                may follow, the Comptroller and Auditor General, if not
                everybody else, knows what the Minister’s mind is on the
                issue. If, in any financial year, a body that does not get
                funding from a Government source on a regular basis gets a
                &quot;substantial&quot; amount of money — as defined by the
                Minister today — even if it is a one-off grant for an item of
                capital expenditure and not for revenue funding, is the
                Comptroller and Auditor General allowed to investigate its
                accounts?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will cover that point as I continue my
                reply. In dealing with the amendment, I have already made some
                points. Moreover, if the Comptroller and Auditor General has
                what might be deemed to be unfettered access to all bodies
                receiving public funding of whatever amount, some people may
                feel that they could face disproportionate scrutiny and that
                honest mistakes could lead to unwelcome publicity. In relation
                to the private sector, commercially sensitive information could
                be open to examination. That could undermine the confidence of
                existing and potential inward investors to the region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It could also be perceived by some as
                amounting to an unwarranted right of interference into the
                private sector. I make the point — if people will allow me to
                do so — that we need to take care while trying to achieve
                sound principles of accountability and in ensuring proper use of
                public money that Members have identified that we do not
                undermine our work to achieve value for money by making
                provisions before we think carefully about them. That might
                perhaps have the effect of inhibiting some firms from tendering
                for Government business, precisely because they might find
                themselves open to inspections that they do not want. Therefore,
                we need to remember that there are purposes that we want to
                achieve in the business arrangements that we make.</p>

                represented differently today, and on previous occasions, than
                earlier in the Committees. Therefore, I think that I have the
                right to address the points. I do think —</p>

                Minister were to conclude his remarks, Members might be able to
                judge whether he has addressed the questions they have rightly
                raised. This is the Committee Stage, and therefore a degree of
                toing and froing is possible and appropriate. If the Minister
                were to have the opportunity to speak, Members may be able to
                determine whether the questions they asked have been answered.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I am not
                sure whether I am reading too much into your remarks. Are you
                saying that after the Minister has spoken, we will have the
                opportunity to ask him further questions? I ask, because the
                Minister introduced new issues. When I attempted to elicit
                further details from him, he tossed his head in the air,
                impatience showing in his face, and he did not seem to want to
                have interventions.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I took from what the Minister said, both
                subsequent to that occasion and again when he had an
                intervention today, that he had some of the answers to these
                questions written down and was eager to deliver them to the
                Assembly. It will only be possible to judge that when we have
                come to the end of the Minister’s responses. I do have to say
                — with some degree of understanding — that the Minister has
                been making responses to the Assembly for almost two full days
                on several issues. I think it is fair to mention that. He should
                be allowed to continue. There is a form of intervention, with
                which I am familiar in another place, whereby at stages of this
                kind, Members can get to their feet as the Minister sits down,
                and before sitting down the Minister may respond. As long as
                such a procedure is not abused, it may be a useful device in
                this House also. The proposer of the amendment is, I see, also
                itching to get to his feet to respond. I mean the mover of No
                15.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, before you are asked to rule on a
                point of order, if a toss of the head is an unparliamentary
                reflex, I apologise to the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to take up the point that has just
                been raised regarding what we can look forward to, and I want to
                make this very clear. In the points that I have just made, about
                how others could view the provisions sought by the amendment in
                the current circumstances, I am not saying that the Comptroller
                and Auditor General should not be given inspection rights over
                such bodies. I have made it clear that I am very open to looking
                further at that area. However, if the Comptroller and Auditor
                General is to be given those rights, it should be after rather
                more thought, care and consultation than has been possible in
                relation to this particular Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Budget statements have been brought forward
                at draft stage and again at revised stage. In addition, there
                have been debates on the Programme for Government, and the
                details of both the Programme for Government and the Budget have
                gone to Committees. Despite all that, Members have said that
                there is still not enough consultation for this House and that
                the relevant Committees have not been able to consider things
                properly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In talking about financial arrangements, as
                we are in this Bill, there are issues not just for the three
                Committees that have been particularly looking at this —
                namely, the Finance and Personnel Committee, the Audit Committee
                and the Public Accounts Committee — but also for other
                Committees that have an interest in the affairs of business.
                They might want to consider the implications of this amendment,
                and might have views to give on it. Committees that are dealing
                with Departments that have many transactions, or that use the
                community and voluntary sectors for the delivery of certain
                programmes, might have a view about the implications of such
                provisions or what sort of balances or provisions need to be put
                in to qualify them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to make sure that we have a degree of
                consideration in this House and with the relevant Committees,
                rather than adopting a legislative measure now in a simple
                reflex response to the very valuable Sharman Report. That report
                was published last week. Among other things, it envisages the
                development of de minimus thresholds for access, and of
                protocols governing the conduct of inspections.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When this amendment was pressed at Committee
                Stage, one of the points that I made was that we should not
                adopt it, but wait for the Sharman Report and consider that
                issue and any other issues that the report raised. People said
                that they did not want to wait for the Sharman Report; that I
                would only tie people to it, and that it was a Whitehall
                document that would not go far. I am glad that people already
                see the benefit of the Sharman Report, but they are referring to
                one aspect of it. There are many other issues that we need to
                take on board and properly consider, not just in relation to
                that particular point but to other points as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, the amendment is to be opposed. It
                is not timely, in that sense. I am glad that there does not
                appear to be a disagreement between us on the relative worth of
                the Sharman Report. I am not aware that any Committee has yet
                been able to consider the implications of the Sharman Report in
                relation to this, or any other, point. We should take the time
                to do so. It could be in the Assembly’s interest, and
                certainly in the interests of many people looking to this
                Assembly, or to Departments, as far as the conduct of their
                affairs is concerned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to recognise that there is a proper
                role for both the voluntary sector and the private sector in a
                mixed economy. We need to respect their proper roles, alongside
                appropriate mechanisms of accountability and regulation, and
                recognise that people appreciate the value, importance and, at
                all times, the integrity of public moneys and the uses to which
                they are put.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Adopting this amendment in the context of the
                Bill, without wider consideration and consultation, would mean
                that we would be unable to move forward in a balanced way.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment also ignores the fact that I
                gave the necessary assurances to the Public Accounts Committee,
                the Audit Committee and the Finance and Personnel Committee
                about matters raised by those Committees and in the context of
                the forthcoming audit reorganisation Bill. I believe that those
                assurances have been accepted by the Committees. After
                discussions with the Committees, I introduced, through the
                amendments made at Consideration Stage, improved inspection
                rights for the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of
                public sector bodies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the provisions of the Bill, the
                Comptroller and Auditor General will have unlimited inspection
                and access rights to the accounts documents and records of all
                public sector bodies. He will also have the right to inspect any
                records that he requires to carry out financial audits and
                value-for-money studies on all public money expended. For bodies
                that are not in the public sector, Departments will have to
                prepare the documentation required by the Comptroller and
                Auditor General to carry out his inspections, whether the public
                money involved is applied as grant-in-aid or as grant. There is
                no restriction on the Comptroller and Auditor General’s right
                to inspect the accounts and documentation that he needs to
                fulfil his function.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The gaps in public sector accountability have
                been closed by the amendment that I proposed at Consideration
                Stage. It would be inappropriate to extend those inspection
                rights to cover voluntary and private sector bodies in this
                Bill, especially as we have had no consultation with the
                relevant interests.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill will give the Department of Finance
                and Personnel wide-ranging powers to give the Comptroller and
                Auditor General access to documents. I also introduced the
                amendment that was made to clause 19(10), which now requires the
                Department of Finance and Personnel to have regard to the views
                of the Public Accounts Committee in any matters of concern.
                Therefore, if there is a cause for concern about the use of
                public funds by a body in any sector, action will be taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assured the Committee that we would consult
                widely on the issue of additional rights and powers for the
                Comptroller and Auditor General and that I would submit
                proposals in the context of the Sharman Report. That report has
                just been published, and its recommendations are complex. During
                the passage of the Bill, I have given assurances that the review
                of audit and accountability arrangements in Northern Ireland
                would be dealt with in the forthcoming audit reorganisation
                Bill. I have also emphasised the importance of consultation with
                bodies that may be affected by any new powers given to the
                Comptroller and Auditor General. Members will also have to be
                canvassed for their opinion. To proceed on any other basis would
                be to put us in a situation in which different Departments and
                Committees would start to identify problems and concerns for
                private and voluntary bodies about the implications of the Bill.
                We should deal with the issues in the round in a Bill that is
                well placed and well timed to address them; that Bill is the
                audit reorganisation Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Sharman Report has been published, and
                proposals on how the consultation process will be handled will
                be brought forward. Some Members have emphasised to me the value
                of consultation on everything else, but they have not done so
                with that report. It would be premature to speak about the
                application of the recommendations of the report before the
                consideration of the report and before consultation has taken
                place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not saying in principle that we should
                never have provisions of the type suggested in that amendment. I
                am saying that we should make the right provisions, reflecting
                full consideration of all the implications and interests
                concerned — not least the key public interest that the
                Assembly has to protect. We have to do that through the right
                legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Time has been constrained for this
                legislation because we have had to introduce it in time for the
                next financial year. The audit reorganisation Bill is not
                subject to those same urgencies. In dealing with all three
                Committees on the legislation, I have stressed, as Members
                indicated, that examination of many of the outstanding issues
                could be taken up in the audit reorganisation Bill. The three
                Committees, as well as other departmental Committees, can also
                do that through fuller consideration of the implications of the
                Sharman Report and its significant recommendations</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Has the Minister inadvertently forgotten that
                he was going to come to several questions during his speech? One
                was from the Member for North Down, who queried where the
                Minister had tucked away the definition of
                &quot;substantially&quot; in his legislation. I asked whether in
                one year a capital project grant would be judged
                &quot;substantial&quot; if it was 50% of the amount given to a
                firm, company or community organisation in that year.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do you wish to reply, Minister?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thought I had dealt with the point about
                50%. Let me make the position clear: the Comptroller and Auditor
                General, whether under the current provisions or any other
                amendment, will take his own view on whatever concerns he may
                have or that are brought to him. If anybody else was prepared to
                say that an impediment was being created by saying &quot;No, it
                cannot be 50% in a given year; it has to be over a longer time
                or over the life of the project&quot;, or vice versa, I do not
                think that there would be an issue. No equivalent provision
                exists in the Westminster legislation. The Department of Finance
                and Personnel and the amendments provide for our taking account
                of the Public Accounts Committee’s views on any issues of
                doubt or concern.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will be brief because we have covered the
                issues. However, there is a danger that in a debate like this we
                get so tied up with technicalities that we lose sight of the
                principle behind the amendment. To clarify and reiterate,
                wherever public money is spent, allocated and appropriated, the
                Comptroller and Auditor General should have the right to inspect
                how that money is spent. That is the clear and certain
                principle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister, after cutting away the verbiage
                and the reasons for not doing it now, kept referring to timely
                and well-timed. We have an opportunity today to do that vital
                piece of work to close that loophole — something advocated in
                Sharman. We should look at what Sharman said now that he has
                reported. However, we were advocating the closure of the
                loophole in the amendment even before Sharman. I am delighted
                that Sharman comes down on the side of those of us on the
                Committee who were arguing for that. I am not surprised, as it
                is common sense. Why would we not have that sort of
                accountability and those powers of inspection? But why wait?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the comments made by the Minister
                today about public and private companies give rise to concerns
                on my part about what the audit reorganisation Bill may
                eventually contain if we say that we will not do this today but
                wait until that Bill is introduced. Private organisations may
                get cold feet. They may want to tender for Government work, but
                they will not want people nosing around to see how they spent
                their money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have an opportunity now and we should
                grasp it, because, after all, this clause deals with
                inspections. Let us ensure that the power of inspection covers
                the whole ambit of public money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister tells us that
                &quot;substantially&quot; means when a body receives 50% or more
                of public funds. However, he and his officials know, as does
                everybody in the House, that if that is not defined in the Bill,
                then it will not be enshrined in law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has still not explained why it
                is not in the Bill. Therefore, his criticism that
                &quot;significant&quot; is not defined has no relevance since he
                has not defined &quot;substantially&quot;. It is no good him
                giving his view if it is not contained in the legislation. It
                must be in the Bill.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What might be substantial to one body might
                not be substantial to another. Given that parties in the
                Assembly receive funding from Government sources, the
                Comptroller and Auditor General might decide that it would be
                appropriate to find out whether they are spending the money
                appropriately.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If he sets this term
                &quot;substantially&quot; beside the political parties, a poor
                and humble party like ours may find that the money that we
                receive constitutes the substantial part of the money that we
                operate on. However, if another party of similar size receives a
                great deal of money from American donations, bank robberies,
                drug dealing or whatever, Government funding may not form a
                substantial part of its money. Therefore, the Comptroller and
                Auditor General could not look at its accounts.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank my hon Friend for his intervention.
                No doubt the Comptroller and Auditor General will address that
                example with due care and attention when he comes to examine the
                parties and their accounts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note the Minister’s comment about a
                reflex reaction as if somehow ours was a hasty decision to move
                this amendment. As he knows, and as we said at the outset of the
                Consideration Stage, this has been the subject of in-depth
                discussion and debate, consideration and scrutiny in the
                Committee and indeed on the Floor of the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Proper care and attention has been given to
                the issue and it has been debated properly. The matter is before
                the House, and now is a timely moment to deal with it. Why
                delay, simply on the ground that the Sharman Report will be
                looked at in detail, when on this particular point Lord&nbsp;Sharman
                comes down fairly clearly on the side of those who support the
                amendment?</p>

                considered in the Committee. I remind him that the Committee
                decided not to pursue an amendment to this effect precisely
                because it wanted to await the Sharman Report and have fuller
                consideration. The Committee also served notice that it will
                bring these points forward in the audit reorganisation Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Notwithstanding the Finance and Personnel

                with bodies that might be affected by these provisions. There
                has been no consultation with any bodies that may be affected.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister displayed irritation when the
                definition of &quot;substantially&quot; was raised again.
                However, on both occasions he failed to answer my question. My
                question was not about his definition or understanding of
                &quot;substantially&quot;, but about where it is defined in the
                legislation. I want to be kind to the Minister. It may well be
                that when Mr Dodds and I examined the legislation, we missed the
                point where &quot;substantially&quot; is defined. I want to give
                the Minister the opportunity to answer this question: where in
                the legislation is the word &quot;substantially&quot; defined?</p>
                <i>

                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At no point did I say that
                &quot;substantially&quot; is defined in the legislation. I said
                that when we used the word &quot;substantial&quot;, that is what
                we take it to mean. It is not a legislative definition. It is a
                clear reference to instances in which the figure 50% occurs.
                Obviously — going back to Mr&nbsp;Robinson’s point — the
                Comptroller and Auditor General does not examine something every
                year. It is in relation to substantial expenditure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, if there is any doubt or concern
                over an issue, we have made it clear that the Department of
                Finance and Personnel will be influenced by the feelings of the
                Public Accounts Committee. Therefore, let us be clear about
                these matters. There is no ambiguity as far as we are concerned.
                I am not trying to pretend that something is specified in the
                legislation when it is not. However, at least I can give a clear
                reference to the figure of 50%, which can be cited as a formal
                reference from now on. That is not the same with regard to
                significant funds.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to return briefly to amendment 15,
                which I put to the House some time ago. I thank those Members
                who supported it, and I thank the Minister for his endorsement
                of it. I suppose that I could cut and run at this point.
                However, it would be cowardly if I did not make some remarks
                about the debate on amendment 17, for I did pose the first
                question to the Minister on this matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House should be aware that this has been
                a very thoughtful consideration of important issues of the
                proper use of public money. Although the debate generated a
                degree of heat, it has been a worthy exchange. Both this week
                and last week, the House has debated an extremely significant
                Bill that will alter our accounting practices and will have
                considerable implications for the way in which that scrutiny is
                carried out. While I dare say that it will not receive the
                attention that it deserves outside these walls, a huge amount of
                time and effort has gone into the work in the Committees. A
                great deal of that work has been reflected in the speeches
                today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like Mr Robinson, I think that the Public
                Accounts Committee and the Finance and Personnel Committee
                should be flattered that Lord Sharman and his colleagues were
                clearly listening in on our deliberations, because several of
                them appear to have been reflected in their recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have taken a quick look at the Sharman
                Report, as have other Members present, but I must emphasise that
                it was only a quick look — there has not been enough time to
                do more. However, during the course of the debate, which has
                lasted a bit longer than I expected it to, I was able to have a
                closer look at a section of the report that is highly pertinent
                to the matter under discussion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report recommends that the Comptroller
                and Auditor General should, for example, be given statutory
                access to certain organisations, some of which fall under the
                ambit of our discussion. Lord&nbsp;Sharman states that that
                access should be given using the Order-making provision in the
                Government Resources and Accounts Act 2000, which was passed at
                Westminster. I point out to this House that that Order-making
                provision is contained in clause 19 of our Bill. However, clause
                20, which was inserted last week at the behest of the Public
                Accounts Committee and the Finance and Personnel Committee, goes
                further than the recommendation that appears to have been made
                by Lord Sharman. It gives the Comptroller and Auditor General
                the right to make an inspection, albeit in defined
                circumstances. We are arguing about the breadth of those
                definitions. I submit that they are fairly wide, though they may
                not be wide enough for Mr Dodds. Nonetheless, I believe that
                those definitions are fairly wide.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems to me that, given the sheer weight
                of this report and the complexity of some of the matters in it,
                we have moved the Government Resources and Accounts Bill quite a
                long way in a short time. We have been required to deal with
                this Bill quickly because it must receive Royal Assent before
                the end of the financial year. I consider that we have probably
                moved this Bill far enough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meanwhile, the work is stacking up for the
                Finance and Personnel Committee in relation to looking at the
                Sharman Report and, in due course, considering the audit
                reorganisation Bill when it comes before us in the autumn. I
                hope that we can get through a few weeks without financial
                matters or matters of civil law reform coming up, so that the
                Committee might have an opportunity to attend to those other
                matters.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, you and every other Member will

                public and business opinion throughout Northern Ireland
                regarding the possibility of irregularities that occurred in
                various elections in the past. Despite this, and three very
                important reports, the Government have been all too slow in
                initiating appropriate action on voting procedures in Northern
                Ireland to address this issue.</p>

                know that Sinn Féin often likes to complain, but there is a
                cabal in that corner, making it impossible to hear about
                electoral fraud. I know that they do not want to hear about
                these matters, because they orchestrate them, but perhaps they
                will have the decency to let the Member speak.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a good occasion to ask everyone to be
                peaceful while we discuss this important issue.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was referring to the report of the Northern
                Ireland Forum for Political Dialogue, and I suppose that it is
                appropriate that I did so as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, are in the
                Chair again today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most disappointing aspects that
                emerged from that investigation was the refusal of the then
                Chief Electoral Officer for Northern Ireland to give evidence to
                the Forum Committee set up to look at the issue. The same Chief
                Electoral Officer did, however, give evidence to the House of
                Commons Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs
                investigation into malpractice on 5 November 1997. I trust that
                on this occasion, our new Chief Electoral Officer will find it
                circumspect to respond to this debate. The Northern Ireland
                Affairs Committee report into electoral practice in Northern
                Ireland was published in March 1998, and the then Secretary of
                State caused the Northern Ireland Office ‘Report of the
                Elections Review’ to be published in October 1998.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to stress that, despite three
                excellent reports, there has been little worthwhile action from
                the Government. Members will be well aware of those parts of the
                electoral process involving registration of voters, publication
                of registers of voters, application for absent votes and the
                voting process itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In dealing with possible electoral fraud in
                future elections — be they parliamentary, local government or
                other — Members will realise that we are stuck with inadequate
                legislation and time factors preventing change. The motion has
                been worded with that in mind and, of necessity, calls on the
                Chief Electoral Officer for Northern Ireland to report to the
                Assembly his plans to counter electoral fraud in legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Democracy is founded on an adherence to the
                will of the people expressed solely through the ballot box, with
                no recourse to other means. Each vote is a building block, with
                the procedures employed for ascertaining the outcome of the
                votes cast being the cementing agent of one’s chosen form of
                democracy. It is our duty, and the duty of those placed in
                positions overseeing our system, to ensure that as little
                corruption as possible exists if our democratic credentials are
                to be valid.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I intend to address my concerns about each
                stage of the electoral process that I have identified, and I am
                confident that other contributors to the debate will ably and
                graphically exemplify those concerns as well as raising others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members are concerned about a system
                that allows for the multiple registration of voters at
                unrealistic addresses. Dr Hendron, among others, can testify to
                examples of this: individual registrations at multiple addresses
                — quite legal, of course, provided you use your vote only
                once. There is also the registration of voters who are known to
                have been living and working in other areas — other
                jurisdictions even — for many years. There is also the
                continued registration of those who are deceased.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What liaison is there with the Registrar of
                Births, Marriages and Deaths to ensure that prompt notification
                of deaths is recorded so that electoral registers can be
                updated? What liaison is there with the Planning Service and
                with local authorities to ensure appropriate occupation levels
                in small flats, or to identify derelict properties being used as
                accommodation addresses? Given today’s technology, are these
                questions unreasonable?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not to deny that voting in more than
                one place is wrong, even for those with a legitimate reason for
                being registered in more than one place. The Northern Ireland
                Affairs Committee report says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;an accurate register is vital&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am certain that many Members have been
                contacted by constituents about people whose names do not appear
                on the electoral register. Indeed, they may have identified such
                people themselves. Such non-registration of those entitled to
                vote must be proactively addressed by the Chief Electoral
                Officer. It should be his duty to ensure that all who are
                entitled to vote be included on the electoral register.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Postal and proxy voting can lend itself to
                abuse. Although we all recognise that there are people who have
                a genuine need to avail of absent voting arrangements, proper
                safeguards must be in place to prevent abuse. Earlier closing
                dates for absent voter applications would assist officials to
                make the necessary checks as well as providing them with time
                for the performance of spot check visits to applicants to assist
                in the validation of applications. Indeed, I welcome moves that
                have been brought to the fore on this aspect. In a letter dated
                10 January 2000, the Northern Ireland Office Elections Unit
                states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;as a consequence of work undertaken by
                the review, legislation was introduced to help tackle the issue
                of absent vote abuse. The legislation now provides for an
                increase in the time available to the Chief Electoral Officer to
                scrutinise absent vote applications&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Chief Electoral Officer decides to
                report to the Assembly, perhaps we should ask him whether he has
                been given sufficient time.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The application form should be adapted to
                include additional information, such as an applicant’s date of
                birth or National Insurance number, which would aid the checking
                procedure. Properly located, fully accessible polling stations
                would encourage many to vote in person, rather than seek an
                absent vote. Checking procedures should be locally based, thus
                allowing local knowledge to be utilised. The availability of
                access to the marked register after elections enables those who
                would seek to abuse the electoral system to identify persistent
                non-voters, whom they can then target for absent vote
                applications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The means of identification to be shown by
                voters must be seriously reconsidered. The medical card, in
                particular, has been highlighted as unsatisfactory. The Northern
                Ireland Affairs Committee report states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The medical card is not a sufficiently
                protected document to provide safe identification and it should
                no longer be included in the list of accepted identifiers for
                polling purposes.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Accounts of the organised mass forgery of
                medical cards will no doubt emerge as the debate develops.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood is not here. If he were, I suspect
                that he would have a tale or two to relate to the Assembly. His
                evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, on behalf of
                the SDLP in 1998, was very informative. Non-photographic means
                of identification are inappropriate, and the issue of voting
                identity cards should be revisited. Some years ago, a commitment
                to this issue was given by Her Majesty’s Government when
                George Howarth assured Mr William Thompson, MP for West Tyrone,
                that the matter of identification would be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, I received a letter from the
                Northern Ireland Office Elections Unit in January. It states:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Government takes the issue of
                electoral abuse very seriously and is committed to ensuring that
                the people of Northern Ireland have an electoral system in which
                they have confidence. It was following allegations of electoral
                abuse in 1997 that the then Secretary of State established a
                wide-ranging review of electoral practice in Northern Ireland to
                formulate proposals to improve the integrity of the electoral
                process.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That dates back to 1997. Why are we still
                waiting for procedures to be corrected? There is a commitment
                that a card will be introduced, which will necessitate, among
                other things, the introduction of registration on an individual
                basis rather than household registration. Not only will these
                changes require primary legislation, but it is important that
                the development of specialised computer technology be carefully
                evaluated before final decisions are reached. I ask again: how
                long do we have to wait?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Procedures for challenge in cases of
                personation need to be enhanced. Is there not cause for concern,
                and indeed outrage, when one considers the remarks made by a
                presiding officer when giving evidence to the Forum Committee?</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In my position I could personally
                identify voters impersonating using allowance books et cetera,
                but needless to say, it is not my duty as presiding officer to
                refuse.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the most recent local government
                elections, I received a telephone call from a policeman. He had
                to watch individuals enter polling stations four or five times,
                obviously using different medical cards, without challenge. He
                also encountered individuals who had discovered that their votes
                had already been claimed. People were stealing votes. The issue
                of electoral fraud must be faced up to. The consequences can,
                and do, corrupt election results.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McCrea will relate to this issue, given
                his experiences in Mid Ulster. The recent by-elections at
                council level have meant that the RUC can confirm that it is
                investigating allegations of electoral fraud following the
                election in Antrim north-west.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist Party, the Democratic
                Unionist Party, the SDLP, Alliance and others have all cried
                foul at some stage after elections. Sinn Féin has accused those
                concerned about electoral fraud of whingeing. That surely shows
                that it would claim to have nothing to fear from proper scrutiny
                of the electoral process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I realise that the Chief Electoral Officer
                will need appropriate resources, finance, staff, equipment et
                cetera to deal with the concerns that arise today, and I hope
                that any report produced will include an assessment of such
                need. Whatever the cost, each elector must have confidence that
                his or her vote is equal to, and as valid as, any other vote
                cast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that others wish to speak. In
                closing, I repeat words that I used when addressing a similar
                motion in the Northern Ireland Forum in June 1997:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the purpose of this motion is not to
                disenfranchise anyone but to ensure that those entitled to vote
                — and I stress the word ‘entitled’ — can do so.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">— and do so with integrity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that the issue has yet to be fully
                resolved, and I trust that it will be.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I beg to move the following amendment: after &quot;report&quot;
                insert</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;on the efficiency of the registration
                process and the balloting process and&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My reason for tabling the amendment is not in
                any way to detract from the original motion’s purpose.
                However, I feared it would focus on only one aspect of the
                electoral process. If the Chief Electoral Officer is to be asked
                to report on the electoral process, he should report on the
                entire process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have also moved the amendment because, from
                my point of view, the purpose of an electoral process is to
                ensure that every individual who has the right to vote is
                enabled, facilitated and encouraged to vote. Electoral fraud
                needs to be addressed. Sinn Féin has nothing to fear from
                scrutiny of the electoral system or from its being made more
                efficient. If measures are introduced to modify the electoral
                system, time will tell how that affects Sinn Féin’s share of
                the vote.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In moving the motion, Mr Hussey covered the
                other aspects of the electoral process, particularly
                registration. He said that the electoral register is vital. I
                agree that a complete electoral register is vital. If a person
                is not on the electoral register, that person will not have the
                right to vote on polling day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have experience of seeing people arrive at
                a polling station on the day of an election only to discover
                that they are not on the electoral register. Members have to
                consider votes quite often, but many ordinary people only think
                of the election on the day of an election.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They have not been registered for various
                reasons. Many people would claim that they never received forms
                through their doors. That may be because the electoral
                registration form is a small piece of paper and because many of
                our letter boxes are full of envelopes and junk mail, the
                electoral form is often mislaid. Occasionally people complete
                the forms but miss the collection; perhaps because no one called
                to collect them or because they could not find the forms when
                the collectors called. If people are not registered during the
                registration process in August and September, the vast majority
                of them will not appear on the register at all and will not be
                able to vote.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One suggestion is that, during the
                registration process, the Chief Electoral Officer should be
                given the finances and resources to mount a publicity campaign
                alerting the public that the registration process is ongoing and
                advising them of the documents required when casting a vote.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For one reason or another, many people who
                are registered to vote will turn up at a polling station without
                the required identification. Perhaps their driving licences or
                passports have expired, or perhaps they never had any. Their
                identification may have been mislaid or they might have left the
                documents somewhere else on the day. Many people do not think
                about an election until election day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Age Concern and the Royal National Institute
                for the Blind made submissions to the House of Commons Select
                Committee on Home Affairs on electoral law and administration,
                pointing out the difficulties the elderly face when registering.
                That issue should be addressed. The elderly, because they are
                not knowledgeable about the registration process, are reluctant
                to fill in forms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Suggestions have been made to the effect that
                more information should be required at registration stage so
                that some form of identification card can be produced for the
                purposes of voting. That would be useful if it led to a
                reduction in electoral fraud, if not to its prevention. However,
                if acquiring that form becomes a difficult and complicated
                process for people with poor sight, the elderly, or those with
                reading difficulties, they will not have open and easy access to
                registration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vocal and public allegations of election
                fraud have been made against Sinn Féin. As Mr&nbsp;Hussey
                stated, several reports have been compiled as a result of those
                allegations. In the Second Report of the House of Commons Select
                Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs 1998 on the electoral
                process, the Northern Ireland Office commented that there was a
                disappointing amount of evidence of vote stealing. It also
                stated that very little material had been submitted to the
                review carried out on electoral fraud.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I went to refer to some comments from the RUC
                in that report. It is not usual for me to depend on information
                supplied by the RUC.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, collusion. The RUC said that there was
                evidence of abuses of the absent system of postal and proxy
                votes. The Chief Electoral Officer referred that abuse to the
                RUC, who examined a sample of votes and discovered that 20% of
                those absent votes that were suspected of being fraudulent were,
                in fact, genuine.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They made no attempt to quantify the extent
                of absent or proxy voting. More significantly, they did not
                reach any conclusion about any one party’s being involved in
                electoral fraud through absent voting. I refer to other bodies
                that have contributed to reports on the electoral process and to
                their determination on which party or parties were involved in
                electoral fraud.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all know that parties can appoint polling
                agents at a polling station to bring instances of personation to
                the attention of the electoral officers and to call on the RUC
                to make an arrest if that is appropriate. The RUC has said that
                there was very little evidence of polling agents informing the
                electoral officers to enable them to investigate — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The RUC said that there was very little
                evidence of its being called upon to deal with personation. We
                have many vocal, public allegations of electoral fraud, but very
                little substance behind them, in spite of the reports and the
                reviews.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to discuss comments made by the Chief
                Electoral Officer in his submission in the report of the
                electoral review of 1998. He said that, while there were some
                indications of abuse of postal and proxy votes, he was provided
                with little evidence to enable him to investigate it. In
                particular, he said, his attention was drawn to a media report
                by the SDLP. The SDLP had stated that personation was widespread
                in the West Belfast constituency. However, despite repeated
                public assurances from the Chief Electoral Officer that he would
                initiate a full inquiry on the production of any evidence, he
                received nothing to substantiate the claims.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have said, we have many vocal, public
                allegations about electoral fraud and about who is responsible,
                but little of substance to provide evidence for a proper
                inquiry, investigation or prosecution.</p>

                have contributed to these reviews have been intimidated. Several
                academics were asked to examine the review of the electoral
                process in the North of Ireland, with particular regard to
                allegations of electoral fraud, and to give their findings. The
                academics agreed that both the SDLP and the UUP were most vocal
                in attacking Sinn Féin and in attributing its successes almost
                entirely to the abuse of the electoral system. David Trimble, in
                ‘The Irish Times’ and the ‘Belfast Telegraph’ on 24 May
                1997 said that Sinn Féin had been guilty of massive electoral
                abuse. However, the academics who responded to the review
                suggested that the abuse that does occur is not confined to one
                party or to one half of the political and religious divide.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prof Brendan O’Leary of the London School
                of Economics stated that, although he is doubtful that abuse
                occurs on a large scale, confidential interviews carried out by
                him with people from all parties — except the Alliance Party
                and the DUP, which I assume chose not to have a confidential
                interview — led him to the conclusion that abuse is
                perpetrated on behalf of all the parties.</p>

                They also conclude that Nationalist voters had realised that
                strengthening Sinn Féin’s electoral mandate was far more
                likely to deliver peace than prolong violence. The report went
                further: it said that Sinn Féin’s adroit campaigning on
                bread-and-butter issues and the strength of our party
                organisation had been cited as ways in which Sinn Féin had
                legitimately consolidated its core vote. Those are the views of
                the academics that contributed to the review of electoral fraud
                in the North following allegations, which were not substantiated
                and for which no evidence was provided, and the view was formed
                independently. Indeed, they concluded by saying that it raised
                the question of whether there were any ceiling to the rise in
                Sinn Féin’s vote. I ask the Assembly to support the amendment
                to the motion in order that the Chief Electoral Officer will be
                required to give a report on the entire process, not only to
                deal with the question of electoral fraud, if and when it
                occurs, but also to facilitate and encourage everyone who has
                the right to vote to do so. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently, a friend of mine from County Antrim
                told me that his great-great-great-grandfather was a sheep
                stealer. However, he admitted to me that there is one thing that
                is much worse than sheep stealing, and that is vote stealing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate Mr Hussey for bringing this
                motion before the Assembly. He mentioned 1997, but this problem
                has been around for much longer than that. This is not meant as
                criticism — it is merely a fact — but it is only in recent
                years that the main Unionist parties have been concerned about
                this problem, and for very obvious reasons. However, it has been
                around for a long time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I first came into this Chamber in 1975 —
                that is over 25 years ago — and certainly for 20 of those 25
                years, I felt that I was not quite John the Baptist, but a lone
                voice in this fight against electoral fraud. If you go back to
                1977, 1978 or 1979, before the birth of the present Sinn Féin
                party, electoral fraud was taking place then. I can well recall
                that people came down the roads in cars; they came on bicycles;
                they even came in prams — well, perhaps not prams — but they
                came in all sorts of vehicles. They were almost like the Scarlet
                Pimpernel — here, there and everywhere. There was nothing
                anyone could do about it. People were changing skirts and
                trousers and putting on wigs outside. It was on a big scale.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That said, although it was very obvious that
                it was being done, it was not done on a professional scale.
                Years later, of course, it became very professional, and in
                recent years it has been so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I move on to the question of identification,
                medical cards, social security cards, passports and so on. The
                medical card identification is a sick joke. Can you imagine
                trying to get a loan or social security benefit by showing your
                medical card as proof of identity?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Tom King was Secretary of State for
                Northern Ireland, my colleague John Hume and I went to see him.
                We presented direct evidence of electoral fraud. Mr McNamee
                talked about evidence — forged medical cards were produced. I
                produced them myself. Medical cards are something that I do know
                something about. Unless you were familiar with them, you would
                not recognise them as being forged. My party has raised the
                issue with every Secretary of State since then — Jim Prior,
                Paddy Mayhew, Mo Mowlam.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In case anyone thinks that this is sour
                grapes on my part, it did not, in any way, affect my electoral
                fortunes at the House of Commons. I stood for the West Belfast
                seat in Westminster four times, and was elected at the third
                attempt. Electoral fraud can affect candidates at Assembly level
                and, perhaps more importantly, at local government level. It
                takes only a few hundred votes either way to change a result.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A colleague of mine put down a motion in the
                House of Commons relating to the Chief Electoral Officer. The
                problem was that there was not a Minister to reply — well, a
                Minister did reply, but he made it clear that he did not have
                the authority to do so. The reason given was that the Chief
                Electoral Officer answered to Parliament.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, Secretaries of State do have certain
                powers. Unfortunately, in recent years they have been slow to
                use them. Young people have boasted of voting 25 and 30 times.
                It was an easy thing to do. Medical cards were handed out in
                tally-rooms, and they were easy to produce. The doctor’s name
                was stamped on it. Every doctor has his own code number, and
                even that could be stamped on the card. All that had to be done
                was to ring the Central Services Agency and ask for the doctor’s
                list for a particular area, and it would be given to you along
                with the code numbers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the time factor. Let me just
                say that identification is a sick joke that has been raised many
                times. Some sort of card that has a photograph on it, for
                example, a smart card that has the latest computer technology,
                is the only way that the public in Northern Ireland can have
                confidence in the voting system.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened with interest to Mr Hussey, and I
                congratulate him on bringing this matter before the House, as he
                did before the Forum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also listened — and I could not believe
                what I was hearing — to the brass neck and brazen gall of Sinn
                Féin. According to them, there is no problem. They even quoted
                the Royal Ulster Constabulary as their source of information on
                the lack of fraud in the voting process, yet they know full well
                that not only does it go on, but it goes on in a very clearly
                systematic and professional way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go to Ardboe at election time. They can be
                seen taking the medical cards out of the boot of the car and
                handing them to people. It is done openly, because they have
                nothing to fear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They say that no one has come forward to
                substantiate those claims. However, that may just have something
                to do with a person calling with a gun at night or with a hood
                over his head, to tell you that if you make that complaint you
                will get kneecapped or you may get shot. That would not alarm
                some Members on the opposite side of the House because it would
                be second nature to them, considering the political ideology of
                their party. Let us make no mistake about it; this has been
                going on, and it is a very serious matter. Some may regard it as
                something to laugh about, but vote-stealing is not a joke;
                robbing people of their right to register their vote is not a
                joke. Many people have gone to polling stations only to find
                that their votes were already taken.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can understand people saying that, in a
                Westminster election, it may not always mean the difference
                between being elected and not being elected. However, the first
                time I was elected in Mid Ulster, I won by a majority of 78
                votes. That was the figure declared. However, if you take into
                account the fraudulent votes of the next person in line that
                majority could have been 2078.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin/IRA are the political masters of
                vote-stealing. They do it without any embarrassment, yet they
                know it is true. In local government, 0·5% of the vote can take
                a seat away from a person — 0·2% of the vote has taken seats
                away from people. This issue really does matter, and we are
                looking at a situation in local government, and in Assembly
                elections, which has relevance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who would want to hold a seat, knowing that
                they had won it fraudulently? Only a person with a background of
                terrorism would try to defend such a situation or want to hold a
                seat won in such a way. No one with any morality or credibility
                would want to be in that position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The British Government must take some
                responsibility because there was the Forum report. Mo Mowlam
                promised that action would be taken. She said that she could not
                take action in time for the Assembly elections but that it would
                be taken before the next Westminster election and before the
                local government election.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, Mo Mowlam has gone; Mandelson has
                gone; another Secretary of State has come, and still, no action
                has been taken to stop those who are robbing people of their
                right to vote. In west Belfast, we found that six people were
                claiming to be tenants of a one-bedroomed flat. When
                investigations were complete, there was no one there, despite
                the fact that six people were registered to vote.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That shows the brass neck of a political
                party that calls itself democratic. It is a stranger to
                democracy; it has robbed seats from the SDLP and others, and
                that is not the way that a democratic system should proceed. The
                motion demands that action be taken, and that a democracy should
                be allowed to decide who is elected to Westminster, the Assembly
                and councils.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that the debate is necessary. I was
                the chairperson for the Forum committee on electoral fraud. That
                committee took representations from a broad cross-section of
                society in Northern Ireland and it was clear that electoral
                fraud was very widespread.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite the Forum report, and that from the
                Select Committee at Westminster, Governments have not responded
                to the Northern Ireland political parties’ concerns about
                electoral fraud. There is nothing more despicable in a democracy
                than vote-stealing. People have laid down their lives in order
                that others could have the right to vote and there is nothing
                more precious than that right in a democratic society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am now more than ever convinced of the
                principle of &quot;no vote, no photo; no photo, no vote&quot;,
                particularly considering the proceedings of the Forum committee.
                It is clear that the documentation used in the past for
                identification has been abused — none more so than medical
                cards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned about the whole question
                of postal and proxy votes. These have been widely abused,
                particularly in the west of the Province. When I look at some of
                the constituencies in the west of the Province and compare them
                with those in the east, I notice a marked difference, which is
                not down to the weather or the climate. There is something
                radically wrong when there is such a difference in the
                applications for postal votes.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, I do not have enough time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was very struck by the evidence given by
                the former Chief Electoral Officer, Mr Bradley, to the Select
                Committee. He said that when he looked at the applications for
                postal votes, two thirds of them were marked red — they were
                discounted and disqualified. That clearly shows the enormity of
                the abuse of the postal vote system. Rather than having these
                votes checked centrally, I ask the Government to consider having
                them checked at local level, where people know the individuals
                making the applications. Photographic identification should be
                produced before a ballot paper is handed over.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several important elements must be considered
                with regard to registration. It should be necessary for people
                to provide their signatures — they should be made available to
                the presiding officer in a polling station. There is also a need
                to make the polling stations user-friendly, particularly for
                those with disabilities. That was one major issue that came
                before the committee in the Forum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment does not add or take away from
                the original motion. The important thing is that Government
                grasp this major problem. As Dr Hendron said, it is nothing new.
                We know the old adage &quot;Vote early, vote often&quot;.
                Northern Ireland is the only place where the dead walk the
                streets on election day. These abuses must come to an end if we
                are to create a society in which it is politics that dominates.
                This debate has come at a worthwhile time — regrettably too
                late for the two forthcoming elections — and I congratulate Mr
                Hussey for raising the issue.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                Is it in order for a Member to slate a whole society of people
                west of the Bann by implying that they engage in massive
                electoral fraud?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not a point of order. I call Mr
                Ervine.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday some Members suggested that we
                spend too long in plenary session. We are now told that we have
                five minutes to deal with an issue of great significance. This
                seems ridiculous to me. That is not your fault, Madam Deputy
                Speaker, but it is something that the Business Committee must
                give some serious consideration to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that Sinn Féin has never been
                involved in electoral fraud because Mitchell McLaughlin said so
                — much as he said he does not know any IRA men in Derry. Of
                course it has been involved in electoral fraud, but it has not
                been alone. The Ulster Unionist Party used to make it its forte
                many years ago. For those who do not want to believe that, let
                us look at one possibility. If a councillor would take key money
                off a tenant, would he take a vote off someone it did not belong
                to? Of course he would.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been corruption in the system for
                years and years. That is why we will be supporting the
                amendment. It adds to the dealing with electoral fraud, the
                dealing with the patheticism of having people tell you the
                difficulties they have when they go to get their vote. They find
                that are not registered, and they cannot understand why.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It also deals with the methodology of
                identification. I have watched people arrive with
                &quot;sea&quot; books — which are very definitive and have
                photographs — and being refused their vote. Benefit books,
                which have no means of identifying their owners, are acceptable.
                It might be somebody else’s benefit book. It might be somebody
                else’s medical card. We have trundled on through the years
                with this pathetic system. Every now and again, we jump up and
                shout about it. Of course, that happens about two or
                three&nbsp;months before an election.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is wrong with teaching children at 15,
                16, 17, or perhaps when they are about to leave school, what
                they can expect in the electoral system and how they can become
                part of the electoral system? Have we thought of doing that? I
                do not think so. Have we thought of having outreach to the
                elderly or the infirm? Have we thought about the value of the
                vote? We hear plenty of lip-service paid to the value of the
                vote. However, its value is measured by the cost of running an
                election.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If, of course, you do not believe that the
                protection of democracy is worth spending the money on, then we
                should not be having this debate. Something definitive needs to
                be done that deals not only with fraud but also with getting
                people easily and properly registered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, we may have to go as far as
                introducing a system such as the one in Australia, where it is
                against the law not to vote. Many Western democracies find
                themselves electing people with a minority of the population
                voting; people who lecture about the political efficacy they
                have because they have the majority of a minority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are genuine about refining our
                democracy, about refining how the population elects its
                representatives, then let us not play games with it. There
                should be some form of electronic mechanism and an abandonment
                of those things that are not definitive to the person.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There should be some formula or system in
                place — and paid for — which ensures that all votes are
                properly regulated. For too long we have heard the complaints.
                If the Shinners were to admit at all that they were involved in
                electoral fraud they might tell you that what they simply did
                was rehash and revamp an old system. It is true. The system is
                ripe for abuse. Therefore, tragically, there will be those who
                see a prize big enough that they will abuse it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the amendment. However, it should
                not detract from the wisdom of the Member who moved the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to debate this
                motion. As a representative of Fermanagh and South Tyrone — a
                constituency that must be in the Guinness Book of Records as
                having the greatest number of elections of any UK constituency
                — I know all about the abuse of the electoral system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the days before identification methods, we
                had buses stopping outside polling stations, people being handed
                slips of paper and directed to vote. We had large caravans
                filled with items of clothing, wigs, shoes, spectacles, all to
                facilitate voting fraud. We even had &quot;rent-a-child&quot;
                with a baby being pushed around giving an impostor the air of
                legitimacy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the introduction of identification
                methods, we hoped that this blatant fraud would end, but it did
                not. There has been review after review, but nothing has been
                done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The previous Chief Electoral Officer gave
                evidence in Westminster on his concerns about electoral fraud.
                He stated that the amount of organised personation that he saw
                was so great that he went to the Secretary of State. The Chief
                Electoral Officer realised that identification documents were
                needed, but was unable to influence those who saw no need to
                take drastic action.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eventually, in 1997, a review was instigated
                by the Secretary of State of the time, Mo&nbsp;Mowlam. The
                review concluded with the launch of the ‘Vote Early, Vote
                Fairly’ document. That document contained many recommendations
                that could have increased the public’s confidence in the
                electoral process. After three years, it has still not been
                implemented. The present Chief Electoral Officer is in a prime
                position to tell us whether any changes have been implemented
                and what information can be brought into the public domain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main recommendation in the Mowlam report
                was that voters should have an identity card. I would welcome
                the introduction of such a card as a positive move to reduce
                personation at elections. Members have already mentioned medical
                cards and allowance books; the use of those documents should end
                immediately, for they are poor means of identification. There
                are abundant accounts of young people allegedly claiming a vote
                with a pension book.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In its submission to the Mowlam review, Sinn
                Féin advocated the removal of all identification documents.
                That would be a ludicrous state of affairs, once again leaving
                the system open to abuse — back to busing and caravans full of
                clothing. There is also serious concern about malpractice in
                postal voting, which deserves attention. One of the
                recommendations in the Mowlam report was the placing of
                watermarks on forms; perhaps that would be a positive step.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The present system is still open to abuse. We
                can have no confidence that our votes will not be rendered void
                by electoral malpractice. This is a reserved matter, and I hope
                that the Prime Minister will take our debate today on board.
                Perhaps he will implement some change — not for this election,
                perhaps, but soon. We cannot continue to put things on the long
                finger and do nothing.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Hussey for bringing the motion to
                the Assembly, although I should also state that there is nothing
                in the amendment that I oppose.</p>

                vote-stealing or building up a party’s strength by any other
                kind of electoral fraud. My concerns were such that I made them
                known to the Government about 12 months ago. I received a
                written reply from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State,
                Mr George Howarth MP. He stated:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Government is committed to bringing

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He qualified that by adding,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;if that is at all possible.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He also said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The legislation will be aimed at
                tackling abuse of the absent voting procedure, both postal and
                proxy, but will also take steps to ensure that as much as is
                possible is being done to prevent personation.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also referred to the use of medical cards
                for identification purposes. Mr Howarth said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I am aware of the concerns about the
                use of medical cards as an approved means of identification at
                polling stations, but for the present there is no means of
                withdrawing this card without putting a large number of the
                electorate to some inconvenience.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He concluded:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Before introducing the Bill, the
                Government will be consulting the parties about the proposals so
                that they can move ahead with broad agreement among parties in
                Northern Ireland.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr Hussey that the Government
                have trailed their feet and have been very slow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to put on record my condemnation of a
                practice that has been brought to my attention. It is one which,
                I regret to say, I am unable to do anything about, and so far it
                has not been touched on in today’s debate. After the Assembly
                elections, my attention was drawn to the practice of
                intimidatory gangs following postmen on the morning that the
                postal votes were being delivered and moving in immediately to
                confiscate them. They confiscated the unopened package from the
                recipient to use for their own political gain. That is all the
                more annoying when often the recipient did not apply for the
                vote in the first place and was not even aware of it until it
                had arrived and was taken from him or her 10 seconds later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That practice is mainly inflicted on the most
                vulnerable people in society, namely the elderly and those
                living alone. I appeal to the family members of those who apply
                for a postal or proxy vote to make an effort to be present when
                the postal vote is being delivered, because their presence just
                might deter those paramilitary-type groups from stealing those
                votes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said earlier that I regretted that I was
                unable to do anything about that activity because the victims
                are terrified of the intruders and are afraid of retaliation if
                they pursue the matter or have it pursued on their behalf. I
                hope that a system will be devised to do away with this most
                cowardly of all electoral abuse practices. I thank Mr Hussey for
                bringing the motion forward.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the course of the Northern Ireland
                Forum for Political Dialogue debate on this subject, my party
                tabled an amendment and we welded the two together and had an
                agreed motion. This was followed by lengthy sessions when a
                committee scrutinised the matter and prepared a report which
                went to the then Secretary of State.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a member of the Northern Ireland Select
                Committee, I brought this issue to the attention of the
                Committee, and it too heard evidence sessions and issued a
                report. Once again a report was submitted to the Secretary of
                State. During the period when Marjorie Mowlam was Secretary of
                State, there was, perhaps deliberately, an attempt to
                long-finger this issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I detected greater urgency during Peter
                Mandelson’s time as Secretary of State, and, indeed, I am sure
                other political parties had meetings with the under-Secretary of
                State, George Howarth, on this subject and are aware of the
                nature of the proposals that he is considering introducing.
                Those will be welcome in dealing — much more effectively than
                the existing regulations and legislation do — with those who
                deliberately, and in an organised way, seek to subvert the
                democratic process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a significant matter. It is not about
                somebody playfully stealing a vote or two; it is not about
                somebody getting one over on the presiding officer in a polling
                station or about voting for poor Johnny, who is unable to go out
                himself because he is ill or away on business elsewhere. It is
                about the organised and almost military use of an organisation
                to ensure that the outcome of an election is subverted, and they
                have succeeded in doing that on a number of occasions in local
                government by-elections.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe, without the slightest doubt, that
                the Mid Ulster Westminster seat was won by the present
                non-oath-taking Member for that area from my Colleague. The
                Electoral Office showed us the number of fraudulent postal votes
                that went through in that area, and it was greater than the
                majority that Mr McGuinness had over my Colleague.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When a television profile was done of one of
                Mr McGuinness’s close confidants at that time — who has
                since fallen out with him — it was interesting to hear him
                admit the extent of the electoral abuse that took place in that
                constituency; one woman voted over 30 times during that
                election. We are told that there is no evidence — evidence
                such as the BBC’s ‘Spotlight’ programme was able to
                produce of six people claiming to be tenants in a one-bedroom
                flat — six people in a one-bedroom flat.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Five people were registered as being resident
                in another one-bedroom flat, and they could not be traced. Six
                people were registered as sharing yet another one-bedroom flat,
                but three of them could not be found. Two of five people
                registered in another flat were also registered at another
                address in the same constituency and at two other addresses in a
                different constituency. According to that evidence, the SDLP
                challenged 200 entries on the West Belfast register, with the
                result that 102 names were removed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Attempts at electoral fraud were clearly made
                in that constituency, and there are countless examples of it.
                There is evidence that some people were engaged in the printing
                and writing of names on medical cards. The police raided their
                centre, but those involved burned the remnants of the medical
                cards in the fireplace as they tried to hold the police off. A
                great deal of evidence has been gathered on that sort of
                activity over the years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people have approached Members about
                electoral fraud because they are afraid to come out publicly and
                give evidence on it. They know that the fellow travellers and
                henchmen of Sinn Féin/IRA would do great damage to them if they
                gave evidence. Members need not get carried away with the
                nonsense that there was very little evidence that electoral
                fraud took place. There was plenty of evidence, and everybody
                knew that in their hearts. The intelligent view of the Electoral
                Office was that this was only the tip of the iceberg and much
                more was happening about which people did not have the full
                details.</p>

                elections in Northern Ireland, with the people who win elections

                I support the amendment and trust that the efficiency of the
                registration and balloting processes will benefit from the
                debate. It is high time that the veil of secrecy surrounding the
                electoral process was lifted. Why should Members be furtive
                about information?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most Members would welcome the proposal if Mr
                Hussey, who moved the motion, was sincere and was seeking a
                change in the electoral system that would make it more open and
                accountable. However, I suspect that the motion is another
                attempt by Unionists to engage in the usual Sinn Féin-bashing.
                It has almost become custom and practice in the Assembly for
                both Unionist groups to use motions for no purpose other than to
                attack Sinn Féin, and I am sure that they have dug deep for
                this one. However, as my Colleague Mr McNamee has stated, the
                evidence to sustain allegations of electoral fraud is very thin
                despite Unionists’ continuing assertions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given its history, the Ulster Unionist Party
                should be the last party to raise the issue of electoral fraud.
                However, I welcome its new-found conversion to the democratic
                process of openness, equality and the principle of one vote per
                person. Electoral malpractice or the culture of electoral fraud
                was patented by the Ulster Unionist Party and copied by others
                long before Sinn Féin ever became involved in contemporary
                electoral politics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most undemocratic electoral fraud ever
                perpetrated on any people or nation was inflicted on the people
                of Ireland by the refusal of Unionists and the British to
                recognise the democratic mandate given by the people to Sinn
                Féin in the 1918 General Election. That fraud has since been
                reinforced by the partition of this island under a threat of
                violence and war. <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every election conducted under the Unionist
                regime since the inception of the state was an exercise in
                electoral fraud. Election day in Unionist- speak was known as
                &quot;resurrection day&quot; — that was the day when even the
                dead voted. Derek Hussey speaks of no recourse to other means.
                Not content with the votes registered by the dear departed, the
                Unionist regime at Stormont passed laws that restricted voting
                rights to property owners or tenants with statutory rights. Such
                restrictions meant that Catholics were disenfranchised, while
                those registered as multiple property owners had multiple votes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, to ensure that the Unionists
                would retain power there was the additional security <i>—

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was the additional security of the
                company vote. In my home city of Derry, electoral fraud was
                practised through the process of gerrymandering. Two thirds of
                the Catholic majority were herded into one ward to ensure that
                the control of local government remained in the hands of
                Unionists. The real fraud was the malpractice, discrimination
                and denial of the democratic right to vote for the majority of
                Catholics for 50&nbsp;years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unionists should acknowledge that the culture
                of electoral fraud was introduced to keep them in power. The
                honourable tradition of voting early and voting often, as so
                often quoted by their political spokespersons — not to mention
                Reverends and Grand Masters — is gone for ever, like the
                missing ballot boxes, never to return.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is little or no evidence to support the
                allegations of electoral fraud. There is, however, plenty of
                evidence available of the intimidation, the harassment and
                arrest of Sinn&nbsp;Féin voters and election agents and the
                murder of Sinn Féin workers. Sinn Féin has nothing to fear

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Hussey raised concerns about
                electoral fraud and, indeed, he should be concerned. After all,
                the honourable Unionist tradition of vote rigging might come
                into play in the polling stations and Orange halls — certainly
                not a neutral venue — and it might cost him a seat at
                Westminster. I support the amendment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for the opportunity that my
                Colleague Derek Hussey has provided to the Assembly. I am
                somewhat nonplussed at having to speak after the previous
                Member. The honourable Lady gave us a hysterical analysis, but
                it certainly was not historical. It was the usual Republican
                rant, which the House is now used to hearing from the Member. It
                has no basis in history at all, and the real tragedy is that she
                actually believes it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Historically, electoral fraud has been rife
                in my constituency of Newry and Armagh. In recent years
                Republicans in South Armagh have been actively engaged in
                elections instead of ignoring them, and they have been using
                fraudulent methods to enhance their electoral performance. There
                is an argument that that is all part of the culture; that, in a
                misty-eyed way, voting early and voting often should be
                acceptable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Electoral fraud has no place, and must have
                no place, in any democratic country. We have to be absolutely
                clear on that. These are not just isolated incidents of people
                dressing up, altering their appearance, or creeping round
                graveyards compiling lists of the recently dead. It is much more
                serious than that. There is systematic operation of fraud and
                the clear evidence continues to grow. It starts with
                registration and it continues on polling day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that, even now, multiple
                applications are made on registration forms in Republican areas
                for family members who have long since left home and who are
                working in other parts of Ireland or the United Kingdom.
                Nevertheless, they are registered for electoral purposes in my
                constituency, and come election day an application will be filed
                for a postal vote or a proxy vote to enable that vote to count.
                That is simply unacceptable. As far as the mover of the
                amendment is concerned, methinks he doth protest too much.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many problems in registration.
                There is clear evidence of the misuse of medical cards. The
                system is open to abuse. Anomalies exist that allow an
                incomplete or out-of-date driving licence, including a
                photograph, to be rejected in favour of a medical card or an
                unemployment benefit book with no photograph that will be
                accepted without hesitation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have personal experience, from living and
                working in south Armagh, of presiding officers, poll clerks and
                election officials, working on election days, being clearly
                aware of electoral malpractice, but who could not and would not
                raise any objection out of fear for their personal safety. That
                is unacceptable, and I therefore fully support this call by my
                Colleague Derek Hussey.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a need to put uniform registration
                methods into place. I am concerned that there is a gap in the
                legislation when it comes to registering residents of nursing
                and old people’s homes and ensuring that people who are
                lawfully competent get every opportunity to exercise their
                franchise. I join with my Colleague, and others, in calling for
                the introduction of an identity card, including a photograph,
                for electoral purposes.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Hussey for raising this matter. It
                is opportune, and certainly an issue of great importance to many
                of us in this Chamber. The electoral system is the key to a
                democratic society. Run correctly, democracy will thrive; run
                incorrectly, democracy will fail — as it has failed in this
                Province. Electoral fraud has led to the corruption of
                democracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the Westminster election and the local
                government election fast approaching, reform of the local
                electoral system will require debate and discussion. We can do
                that today, with a view to addressing the problem of electoral
                fraud. The legislation relating to elections must be tightened
                up if we are to combat electoral abuse successfully. The very
                existence and frequency of electoral fraud in Northern Ireland
                is well documented. It is accepted by the Chief Electoral
                Officer. William McCrea and Peter Robinson have already given
                some examples of it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is absolutely no doubt that Republicans
                especially have been involved in corrupting the electoral
                process — adopting a &quot;vote early, vote often&quot;
                attitude. There have been major problems with electoral fraud in
                the past, especially involving personation, postal votes and the
                use of fake medical cards. Republicans have used the Ecstasy
                tablet of vote rigging to increase their vote. We should perhaps
                put on record that if the electoral system were to be changed,
                the vote that IRA/ Sinn Féin has could be diminished and be put
                into perspective. We hope that that will be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential that the integrity of the
                electoral process be maintained and that those who abuse the
                system be restricted from using it. Voting should always
                reinforce the democratic system — not distort and corrupt it.
                That is why the only solution is to introduce measures that will
                stamp out electoral fraud and therefore ensure that democracy is
                the winner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present, absent voting is one of the most
                abused areas of the voting system. The problem is more acute in
                areas of personation or the production of fraudulent
                identification documents. To tighten up on absent voting,
                legislation has been introduced to extend the period in which
                the Chief Electoral Officer can examine applications before the
                relevant forms are dispatched. That is a positive step, but no
                one can say that it is radical.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been a proposal — unfortunately,
                it has yet to be implemented — which suggests the
                establishment of dedicated investigative teams to scrutinise all
                applications at all stages. For example, if a name appears more
                than once but is registered at a different address it must be
                investigated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The use of addresses of houses that are
                derelict or have not been lived in for some time has become
                common practice among those abusing the system to secure an
                extra vote. Some of us are aware of instances in which people
                have been registered to vote at addresses where the doors, the
                windows and even the chimneys are blocked up. There is no way in
                which anybody could get in or out of them; the only ones who
                could vote from those houses would be the mice. Whether or not
                they are registered, one can only guess.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I find it incredible that people have been
                able to abuse this system for so long. It is very important that
                those who have the right to vote are protected, while those who
                abuse the system are prevented from doing so any longer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to highlight a couple of issues about
                appropriate identification at polling stations. What about the
                production of a firearms certificate? It is not a legitimate
                means of identification, but it could be — not the firearms,
                just the certificate. Some people can probably produce many
                firearms, though whether that is before or after decommissioning
                I cannot say.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A driver’s licence with a photograph on it
                is another example, but at the moment you must have other forms
                as well. I would have thought it ample to present a driver’s
                licence with the photo card. It is important that it is the
                individual who is registered as opposed to his home. The
                registration of a voter must be checked and double-checked —
                as it should be with any system — and it would be a way of
                identifying the issues and providing stronger powers for
                presiding officers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Electoral staff have also suffered
                intimidation. For example, staff were intimidated when a polling
                station was petrol-bombed at Shantallow in Londonderry. One
                Member spoke earlier of a complaint that those who were
                intimidated in polling stations cannot report the personators.
                We want an effective and reliable electoral system that can
                resist deliberate abuse.</p>

                party wishes to have any information or any opinion. Of course,
                that is embarrassing to its members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McNamee quoted the RUC when he said
                that there was no evidence of challenges. Of course there was no
                evidence when there was a mob outside a polling station and
                people inside fingering those who might dare to make challenges.
                On the logic that Mr&nbsp;McNamee has used today, there was no
                such thing as the Omagh bomb, since the RUC could not find any
                evidence against people because of intimidation; there was no
                such thing as the Enniskillen bomb because no evidence could be
                provided —</p>

                Of course there is evidence, and it has been quoted here today.
                Examples include the number of people who have been taken off
                the electoral register after challenges have been made; the
                multiple applications from one address; and confirmation from
                the Electoral Office of widespread evidence that postal votes
                are claimed fraudulently. Of course there is evidence. There
                would be far more of it if Sinn Féin/IRA was not backed up by

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then, in an attempt to deflect criticism from
                his friends in Sinn Féin, Mr Ervine focused on the Unionist
                Benches. Unionists also use this tactic, and his refrain was
                gladly taken up by Mrs&nbsp;Nelis in what some might call an
                historical speech — it was more of an hysterical speech, and
                it involved very little history.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Nelis claimed that Unionists had
                introduced a property qualification, but that was not the case.
                A property qualification had always been a stipulation, even
                under British electoral law until 1949. When that property
                qualification was abandoned in Northern Ireland in the 1960s, it
                did not make a button of difference to the outcome of elections.
                The property qualification applied to Catholics as well as to
                Protestants, though she chose to overlook that in her hysterical
                rant in which she attempted to justify her own party’s
                position. There is no justification for the fraud that has been
                perpetrated, mostly on behalf of IRA/Sinn Féin. It owes the
                fact that it has won seats on councils, in the Northern Ireland
                Assembly and at Westminster to what can only be described as
                systematic fraud against the electorate in Northern Ireland. No
                amount of support from other people, who might have a common
                agenda with it, will ever cover this up, nor will the turning of
                blind eyes.</p>

                There has been some misunderstanding — evidence, evidence,
                evidence. Hansard will record that on three occasions I referred
                to evidence of abuse of postal and proxy voting. That evidence
                was supported by the RUC, the Chief Electoral Officer and those
                academics who were asked to contribute to the review of the
                electoral process here and examine the allegations of electoral
                fraud. I did not say that there was no evidence of electoral
                fraud. However, I did say that there was no evidence of Sinn
                Féin’s electoral successes being due to electoral fraud or of
                Sinn Féin being the only party involved in electoral fraud. In
                my opinion, all of the parties referred to have been involved in
                electoral fraud.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, let there be no misinterpretation
                of what I said. I recognise the existence of electoral fraud and
                how it was addressed. There are, of course, many anecdotes about
                electoral fraud. We heard Mr P Robinson’s account of six

                unnecessary, and if Members had listened carefully to my speech
                on the motion, they would have noted that issues raised in the
                amendment had already been addressed. The entire process was
                mentioned. Registration issues were addressed, with a call for a
                more proactive approach from the Chief Electoral Officer in
                order to ensure full representation on the register.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The resources issue referred to by Mr McNamee
                was addressed, with a call for appropriate staffing, funding and
                equipment to enable the Chief Electoral Officer to fulfil the
                purpose of scrutiny in which he and his officers are engaged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McNamee referred to the Northern Ireland
                Affairs Committee report, stating that there was little evidence
                in it. Polling agents have a problem of duty, vis-à-vis their
                legal ability to apprehend someone in the course of personation.
                Mr McNamee forgot to consider the reasons for difficulty in
                presenting cases of personation, mentioned in paragraph 69 of
                the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee’s report. The words,
                directly quoted from the document, which Mr McNamee edited in

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Dr Hendron for his contribution and
                agree with him and Mr Ervine, and others, that electoral
                malpractice is not new. Perhaps, in the days when there were
                just two major parties, each party’s efforts were cancelled
                out by those of the other. I also agree with Dr&nbsp;Hendron
                that such electoral malpractice was not carried out on the
                massive organised scale that we see now and I am glad that he
                supports the idea of photographic identification.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McCrea and others have referred to the

                Assembly election there were several incidents in West Tyrone in
                which people who were intending to carry out voting fraud
                disappeared when challenged. There is no method of recording the
                number of people who attempted such fraud. The votes that were
                recorded under protest were never challenged, and the electoral
                office took no action. The pink forms were produced and put in
                envelopes, unchallenged, but after the election no action was
                taken in respect of persons who carried out electoral fraud.</p>

                think that we were getting into a West Tyrone-only scenario —
                an accusation that has been made in the past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson referred to the need for
                photographic identification and local checking of absent vote
                applications; I agree totally. I also agree with what Mr Ervine
                said about past electoral malpractice. To some extent, no party
                in the Assembly is lily white; we cannot account for all the
                actions of those who are willing to work and expend their best
                efforts for our respective causes. Mr Ervine said that he would
                support the amendment; I suggest that I dealt with the issues
                mentioned in the amendment when proposing the motion.</p>

                addressed the issues in his commentary. However, the motion that
                the Assembly will vote on does not mention registration or

                political instruction. I am sure that we would all agree that
                our young people should be properly instructed in the political
                situation in which they find themselves. I hope that I have
                already addressed the points that he made about the value of the
                vote.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson referred to the Sinn Féin
                proposal for the removal of the requirement for any means of
                identification, as mentioned in the report of the House of
                Commons Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs. Why does
                Sinn Féin favour such a move? Mr Bradley has written evidence
                that the Government recognise the problem; they promise
                remedies, but do not deliver. Other Members have referred to
                that problem. I sympathise with him over the
                &quot;follow-the-postman scenario&quot;; that is a frequent
                complaint in my constituency as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson talked about the long-fingering
                of the issue under Mo Mowlam. I hope that the present Secretary
                of State can reinvigorate the issue and take it forward with a

                constituency a census enumerator was murdered in 1981. With
                regard to electoral fraud, I wonder whether any person in the
                House is aware of eight voters living in a two-bedroomed house.
                Mrs Nelis said that electoral fraud was perpetrated to ensure
                electoral supremacy. Do two wrongs make a right? Should somebody
                continue with such a scenario in a militaristic, organised way
                now?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy referred to absent voters, people
                working and living elsewhere. I can think of one of my
                constituents: if you are living and working in New York it is
                difficult to go to the polling station in person. Perhaps that
                is the reason that person has a proxy vote, in spite of his
                being a naturalised American citizen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon referred to derelict properties. I
                suggested that there should be some way in which derelict
                properties can be identified to ensure that nobody on the
                register can claim to live in one.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, Mr Wilson, with his usual
                exuberance, finished off the debate in fine fettle. I will leave
                it at that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The old call, as we all know, was &quot;Vote
                early, vote often&quot;, but what we are trying to achieve in
                this debate and in the motion that I have placed before the
                House is the call that headlines the report of the elections
                review of October 1998, namely that we vote early and vote
                fairly.</p>

                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted to see that the Finance
                Minister has come back to the Chamber. I hope that he has left
                his grumpy head behind and is not going to be tossing his head
                impatiently on this occasion. I hope that he will give us a fair
                hearing and respond to the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the motion refers to East Belfast,
                it is just as relevant to many other parts of the Province,
                particularly other parts of the city of Belfast. It might be
                worthwhile to start with an explanation of how a valuation is
                determined for a property. The Valuation and Lands Agency (VLA)
                will inspect it. It will make a determination of the net annual
                valuation based on the size and type of property, its location
                and the attractiveness of the setting or, if it is a commercial
                property, its attractiveness in commercial terms. I should say
                that I have a background in estate agency, which I left to enter
                politics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The valuation of a property determines what
                portion of the rate being levied across the Province that the
                property owner pays. As a consequence, it determines the amount
                that the holder of the property will pay towards services that
                are provided at a district level or at a regional level.
                Depending on how much the district or regional rate increases,
                the ratepayer will be exercised to a greater or lesser extent.
                Certainly, when a substantial increase in the regional rate was
                proposed, it set alarm bells ringing for many in the commercial
                sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The case that I bring to the attention of the
                Assembly does not relate to the level of increase. However,
                during discussions with traders after the levying of the
                increase, it was drawn to my attention that special problems
                occur in redevelopment areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we assume that the VLA has made an
                accurate assessment of the net annual valuation of a property,
                that valuation can be changed by a change of circumstances in
                the area, or by something relating directly to the property.
                Something interesting happens at that stage, because if one
                applies for planning permission to extend the property, one can
                be absolutely certain of what will happen a few months later.
                One will receive a letter, visit or phone call from the VLA. It
                will say that the agency would like to carry out a new
                assessment of the net annual value of the property. Proactively,
                the VLA — spurred on, no doubt, by the Minister responsible
                for finance — will ensure that the new net annual valuation
                reflects the circumstances that then exist. Therefore, if one
                improves one’s property by extending it, one can be sure that
                proactive action will be taken by the agency concerned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If, for instance, the use classification of a
                property is changed, again one can be sure that a new assessment
                will follow, to check whether the new use to which one has put
                the property has a higher net annual valuation than previously.
                Again, the VLA will move proactively to ensure that if
                additional money is required from the ratepayer, it will be
                received.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, if there are elements to the
                detriment of one’s company, the valuation officer does not
                seem to know the address or telephone number, nor does he bother
                to visit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many circumstances in which there
                will be a detriment to a property. That will arise where there
                is no proactivity on the part of the Valuation and Lands Agency,
                the Rates Collection Agency or the Department of Finance and
                Personnel or whoever has energised the VLA on the earlier
                occasions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw the attention of the Assembly
                specifically to the issue of redevelopment. Take, for example, a
                street of shops that is servicing a local community. The example
                that I shall give is the Castlereagh Road — an incidence that
                came up recently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An arterial route and several shops serve the
                community in that area. The Department, through its agency, the
                Northern Ireland Housing Executive, decides that it is going to
                redevelop the area. No doubt, the aim is to improve the quality
                of life for the people who live there and to improve the housing
                standards that they will then enjoy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When it happens, all the customers for those
                shops are removed from the area. That is not something that
                crept up on the VLA without notice. It is not as if it is not
                able to determine that there will be a massive impact on the
                shopkeepers there. It knows it, and it knows it through the same
                kind of procedures that tell it when someone is extending his
                shop or premises.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The VLA knows that if a planning application
                is approved, there will be an increase in the value of that
                property, so it reassesses it. It knows that if a redevelopment
                notice is posted there will also be an impact on a property. The
                VLA should, therefore, proactively follow to ensure that the
                rates are reduced for that individual and avoid the hardship for
                those who have to go to the agency and ask it to carry out that
                reinspection.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The experience of almost everyone that I have
                met in dealing with the issue is of an uphill struggle to get
                the VLA to accept the detriment to a property as a result of
                that kind of thing. The meagre reduction that has taken place,
                in the cases where there has been a successful outcome, has not,
                in any way, compensated for the reduction in income that has
                occurred as a result of redevelopment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The outcome, therefore, is fairly clear. I am
                asking the Minister — and I do not ask or expect him to jump
                to any conclusions today — to consider looking at how,
                proactively, he can ensure that the VLA inspects and assesses
                the change in the net annual valuation of a property because of
                redevelopment. The VLA knows that it is happening. It could
                easily do it in the same way that it can when a planning
                application is made. The VLA knows that more money is available
                should it reinspect. Can he set a procedure in motion to ensure
                that that happens?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also ask that, if he does that, he take the
                further step and ensure that the procedures, if the person is
                successful, ensure a satisfactory outcome. The Minister really
                must reassess whether adequate reductions are being made, even
                if only on a temporary basis. One must assume, if redevelopment
                is taking place, that the customer base will return, but those
                years can be crucial to the livelihoods of the shopkeepers
                involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are to have a thriving community when
                redevelopment does take place, and we are to have a group of
                shops after the new houses are built and the people return, it
                is vital that we do not leave those shops hanging out there, as
                they are at present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At my meeting with the traders on the
                Castlereagh Road, they spoke, one after the other, of the
                hardships that they are facing as a result of redevelopment.
                They also spoke of the extent to which they would need to spend
                their own money to challenge professionally the valuation of
                their properties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever they are selling — sweets,
                cigarettes, clothes, books — their expertise is not in
                valuation. Their ability to argue their case is limited by the
                nature of their profession. Therefore, they have to buy in the
                expertise in order to challenge the valuation of their property
                — a costly endeavour for them. Such are the conundrums that
                they face. Their funds are reduced because their customer base
                has been removed. They have to use their own money to challenge
                the valuation of their property.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister look at the procedures,
                with a view to making them more user-friendly and less
                intimidating for people who wish to challenge the valuations?
                Will he also make sure that when a redevelopment occurs —
                wherever it is — the valuation office will reassess the
                valuation of the properties that will be most affected by it?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Member for drawing the House’s
                attention to an issue that is causing great difficulty. Many
                people wish that their area could be enhanced, but even after an
                area such as the one that I come from has been enhanced, the
                developers usually knock down three houses and build just one in
                their place. The problem does not exist only during
                redevelopment — when houses are vacated and the area becomes a
                wasteland — it continues beyond that point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such communities did not ask for the increase
                in traffic, as people drive by to the many supermarkets that
                have grown up, like small towns, in east Belfast. We cannot
                decry the shops; they bring jobs and people seem to like them.
                However, those who live on the ribbon development that my
                Colleague spoke about suffer the loss of passing trade because
                parking at out-of-town shops is more convenient. They also
                suffer because they live in areas that have a low level of home
                ownership. For example, a shop owner might, for his own sake,
                enhance the property, but he will receive no appreciation for
                his efforts. Mr Robinson described the position well. If someone
                wants to renovate their property when the area is being
                redeveloped, someone will appear quickly on the doorstep to do
                an upward revaluation. When the area is blighted — I think
                &quot;blight&quot; is the correct word — no one rushes to
                their aid.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The redevelopment of an area is not just
                about giving people nice houses to live in, although that is
                valuable. It is about retaining the services and the points of
                contact that have been part of the community. Not only are the
                residents sometimes scattered to the four winds, but
                circumstances are created in which traders and other owners of
                commercial property cannot compete. The point of contact for
                their services has gone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently, we spoke about out-of-town
                developments and about a possible need to restrict large
                developments. There was relative consensus in the House that
                that was the wrong way to go if we were to hold communities
                together and retain services. Mr&nbsp;Robinson mentioned the
                Castlereagh&nbsp;Road, which is as good an example as any; at
                night, it is like a canyon. That is also true of the Newtownards&nbsp;Road
                and the Albertbridge&nbsp;Road; there is little activity on
                them. No one is being drawn to those places; people are being
                drawn to other places.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The community has taken a good kicking,
                whether from the planners or from those who can adjust the
                rateable values to meet the needs that undoubtedly exist, and I
                ask the Minister to pay specific attention. In fairness, Mr
                Robinson, in moving the motion, did draw attention to other
                places — it is not just a question of east Belfast. Many areas
                in Northern Ireland suffer similar problems.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make an observation and I hope the
                Member agrees with me. Although this debate is focused on
                valuations, a multi-agency approach is required. Planning has an
                objective of securing arterial routes. Knowing that there is a
                reduction in the number of people living in the area, you can
                replace the people who go to the shops if there is somewhere for
                them to park and shop in the area. That is how the Newtownards
                Road and the Cregagh Road have survived for years. It is
                extremely difficult to get that multi-agency approach because of
                the rigidities of Roads Service and Planning Service.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has made the point more succinctly
                than I could have, and I agree. I also have a feeling that the
                Member who introduced this to the House would not disagree. He
                is quite capable of speaking for himself, of course.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is great deal of suffering, and until
                now it has been largely ignored. Now there is somewhere for the
                issue to be raised, and there is a receptive Minister who, one
                hopes, will take cognisance of all the difficulties and be
                prepared to ensure that those difficulties ease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a final point to draw to the attention
                of this House. I hope you do not rule me out of order, Madam
                Deputy Speaker, because this expressly deals with the issue of
                commercial property. Recently, I have been reminded of the
                difficulty of homeowners in a redevelopment area who find
                themselves being asked to pay a Housing Executive rent. The
                Housing Executive will charge them a rent for a substantial time
                before vesting takes place. When the tenants get the value of
                their house, they find that they have frittered away a
                substantial amount paying rent for a house that they own. There
                are quite a number of issues in redevelopment areas that need
                serious consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the future we will have to take a
                different approach to redevelopment. We need to introduce the
                concepts pointed out by my Colleague, the Minister of
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment. We need a holistic approach,
                cutting across departmental lines and ensuring that the people,
                whether traders or residents of redevelopment areas, get a
                better crack of the whip.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not going to go over all the points that
                have been made, as that would simply be a repetition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From my experience of the issue, let me note
                some of the excuses that have been made by the Department for
                refusing to act on this issue. It is not a new issue. Since I
                was first elected 20 years ago, has been an ongoing sore in
                redevelopment areas. The first time I came across it was in
                Castlereagh Street, where 11,000 homes in east Belfast were
                going to be affected by the redevelopment proposals. Arterial
                routes especially were going to be affected by the removal of
                such a large part of the population.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Department’s excuse, made time
                and time again, does not stand up to scrutiny. Mr Robinson has
                already dealt with the question of resources. The Department
                very often says that it cannot respond, because so many
                properties are affected by this that it simply does not have the
                resources to revalue properties downwards when redevelopment
                areas are declared.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, as has been pointed out, properties
                that have been improved can be dealt with fairly quickly. I
                would appreciate it if the Minister could give us some
                indication of why, since most of the shops involved provide
                local services, example cases can not be taken and then applied
                across a range of commercial properties in an area. That would
                mean that every property would not have to be individually
                revalued, and, at the same time, cognisance could be taken of
                the effect that redevelopment has on commercial activity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second argument made to me is that
                redevelopment in adjacent streets may well affect part of the
                business of shops on arterial routes. However, that is not where
                they get all of their business from anyway; much of it comes
                from outside. The fact that they are on an arterial route means
                that a great deal of their business is left intact, and the
                removal of some streets behind those shops does not greatly
                affect the valuation of the properties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, one has only to listen to what traders
                say about their takings to realise that that is not the case.
                Secondly, it must also be accepted that many of these
                redevelopment areas cover many properties. Mr Peter Robinson
                mentioned the example of the Castlereagh Road. Approximately 700
                houses adjacent to the shops on the Castlereagh Road have been
                removed, which represents a substantial customer base.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr David Ervine mentioned the Newtownards
                Road. The present proposal for redevelopment on this road — in
                fact, there are several proposals, which have rolled into each
                other over the years — will involve over 800 houses being
                knocked down. Similar amounts of houses have been knocked down
                in redevelopments that have just finished in areas adjacent to
                it. A substantial customer base has been taken away, and to say
                that redevelopment affects commercial properties only in a very
                small way is not true.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It does not matter whether you are talking
                about east or north Belfast, you only have to look at the tracts
                of areas involved to see that a large number of properties have
                been removed and, therefore, that a large number of customers
                have been removed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other thing that must be borne in mind is
                that many of those shops may depend on outside trade. However,
                whenever redevelopment takes place, it not only moves the
                existing customer base, it also blights an area; it makes an
                area unattractive. People do not feel happy about going into an
                area that seems to be derelict.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Very often there are areas of waste ground;
                frequently there is rubble lying around. As a result of the
                isolation, there could be anti-social behaviour, which, in turn,
                makes it appear even more derelict. Therefore, people steer away
                from it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department’s argument that the removal
                of the houses in the immediate vicinity will not leave
                businesses without outside custom coming in is not an acceptable
                one. It is clear that people are not prepared to come into areas
                that have been blighted by redevelopment, because they do not
                look attractive and because of the kind of behaviour that often
                goes on in them. Because of that blight, people are not happy
                about taking cars in, for example, and leaving them parked in
                semi-derelict streets adjacent to commercial properties.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A third reason, which I have heard from the
                Department in the past, has been that it is only a temporary
                arrangement. However, anyone who has lived through the
                redevelopment process will know that it takes about eight years
                from the time that a redevelopment area is declared until the
                redevelopment and new properties are finally put in place. It
                takes that long for the vesting, relocating people, properties
                being knocked down, planning permissions being sorted out and
                getting builders on site.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Areas take eight years to go through that
                transition, and adjacent commercial properties are detrimentally
                affected during the entire period. For the Department to argue
                that it sorts itself out fairly quickly, and that revaluing
                downwards and then upwards again would tie up resources, fails
                to recognise how long the redevelopment process takes.
                Therefore, it is important that the Minister makes some response
                to the genuine claims of those people who try to hang on in
                redevelopment areas, so that services are still there when the
                area is redeveloped.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is part of planning policy to attract
                people back into the inner city and to develop on brownfield
                sites. People will not be attracted if there are no local
                services. Unfortunately, redeveloping and making inner-city
                sites attractive again tends to make it more difficult for
                services to survive in the interim period.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel (Mr
                Durkan):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Robinson for bringing this matter
                to the House and, in particular, for drawing attention to some
                significant issues and considerations in relation to valuation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a couple of points that may need to
                be set in context, particularly the question of the basis of
                rateable valuations. A property’s rateable value is based on
                the rental value that the property would be expected to achieve
                in its actual state and circumstances. That is based on a
                valuation date, and the current valuation date for all
                commercial properties is 1 April 1995, which was the valuation
                date before the last revaluation. I have already said that there
                will be a further non-domestic revaluation, which the Assembly
                has agreed to, effective from 1 April 2003.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Properties were last revalued on rents that
                existed on 1 April 1995. Accordingly, the rateable values
                reflect the social, economic and environmental circumstances
                that prevailed at that time. I recognise that particular point;
                it is true for all properties. It is common to the valuation
                base of all properties, even new properties that might be
                developed and are subject to planning permission, or even, as Mr
                Robinson said, to valuers who might inspect properties and try
                to put a valuation on extensions. Every valuation refers to that
                valuation date in 1995. That is part of the valuation system.
                Obviously, when there is a revaluation, all ratepayers should be
                charged in direct proportion to the rental value of the property
                that they occupy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that a uniformity of
                liability is established, although I recognise that it is eroded
                over time because there are differential shifts in rental values
                from one property to another, and from one location to another,
                for various reasons — redevelopment being one of them. That is
                one of the reasons why we need regular revaluations. They are
                the most sensible way to ensure that valuations are as
                reflective as possible of real and prevailing circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I make the point again that the
                basis of valuation is not just pure assumption by the valuers.
                It is based on rental value. It essentially represents the rent
                the premises would command if let on the open market at a fixed
                point in time. That represents approximately 40% of rental
                value, which in turn averages about 8% of capital value.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One could argue that rates therefore equate
                to about 3% of capital. I am not saying that to minimise the
                significance of the rate burden, particularly for businesses
                that may be trading in marginal circumstances — not least
                because of changes in their circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is limited scope between revaluations
                to take changes in economic circumstances into account. Contrary
                to what Sammy Wilson said, I believe that if we were continually
                revising assessments up and down to reflect all sorts of changes
                — either in the particular trading circumstances of given
                businesses or underlying and market conditions — the valuation
                system would soon become unworkable. The concentration at
                present is therefore on trying to establish regular and timely
                revaluations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, highly localised factors that could
                be combined with some physical change can be reflected in
                altered assessments between revaluations. I take it from what Mr
                Peter Robinson said that he has some knowledge of that, but he
                believes — or the people who have spoken to him believe —
                that such reassessments have led only to fairly marginal
                adjustments in the valuations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anything that is being done here is
                constrained by the rating law, and that governs the conduct of
                the valuers. It is the rating law that governs this; it is not
                primarily a matter of resources. It is not a case of the
                Valuation and Lands Agency choosing not to do something just
                because it has not got the resources, or of the Department
                choosing not to allow the agency to do it by not allocating it
                the necessary resources. A change in the character of an area is
                really a matter to be picked up in the revaluation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an appeals process. People can
                appeal a revaluation and, if they are not satisfied, the Lands
                Tribunal is an independent court in that regard. If people are
                aggrieved with a rating assessment they can make an application
                to the district valuer and, if they are still not satisfied,
                they can appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation and then to the
                Lands Tribunal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The district valuer in Belfast is not aware
                of any application for revision of the valuation list on grounds
                of location in, or close proximity to, a redevelopment area.
                Similarly, there are no appeals to the Commissioner of Valuation
                or the Lands Tribunal on this issue. Similar points apply to
                domestic properties. That issue was touched on by David Ervine
                in particular.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that the circumstances of the terms and
                evaluations are those that prevailed at the time of revaluation,
                little can be done to change the circumstances between
                revaluations, as some Members are seeking. Some reductions have
                taken place, and I will write to Mr Robinson with examples. They
                may be similar to some of the cases that people have brought to
                his attention. From the information that is available to me, I
                do not recognise the problem as acutely as Mr Robinson does.
                However, I recognise that people believe that revaluations
                should take place on the basis of any change in their trading
                circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No Member mentioned whether there were
                significant changes in the rents charged on some of these
                properties. Rents are relevant. If there were localised
                revaluations they would be based on the rental values that
                existed at the revaluation date, which, in this case, was 1995.
                That applies to new valuations to new properties as well as to
                any other property. They have than in common.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we were to move in the way that Members
                want, it would raise the issue of whether we would be working
                from a uniform base. That is important — not least with regard
                to the regional rate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members said that the system is less
                than responsive and that they find that it is unable to make the
                revisions and changes in people’s circumstances that they
                would like to see. The law restricts on that. If there are other
                ways in which the Valuation and Lands Agency is not considered
                to be user-friendly — as has been suggested — I, and the
                agency, will examine them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members referred to the benefits of
                professional representation. The Valuation and Lands Agency does
                not require people to be professionally represented, and it does
                not favour those who are. The agency is interested in fairness,
                and the valuer will always speak to the ratepayer no matter who
                else is involved. If there are any issues or grievances about
                the treatment of individuals, properties or cases that Mr
                Robinson wants to draw to my attention I will be happy to take
                those up with the agency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I did not know the area of east Belfast the
                Member was concerned about, but I now know that it is the
                Castlereagh Road. The areas that are formally designated or
                recognised as redevelopment areas tend to be those with domestic
                properties. There are five such areas, and the Castlereagh Road
                is not one of them. Members talked colloquially about
                redevelopment areas rather than meaning a redevelopment area as
                designated by a Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have noted the points that Members have
                made. Those points strengthen the case for ensuring that the
                Assembly efficiently progresses the revaluation of non-domestic
                properties and makes sure that there is a realistic valuation
                base for non-domestic rates. Revaluation is the key to that.
                However, I will make information available to Mr Robinson on any
                localised reviews that have taken place as they might assist in
                any representation that he may want to make about a location.</p>
