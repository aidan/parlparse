                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By virtue of paragraph 1 of the schedule to
                the Northern Ireland (Elections) Act 1998, it falls to the
                Secretary of State to determine where meetings of the Assembly
                shall be held and when. I have received from the Secretary of
                State a letter directing that the Assembly shall meet at
                Parliament Buildings, Stormont at 10.30 am on Monday 14 December
                until 6.00 pm on Tuesday&nbsp;29&nbsp;December.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will appreciate from the Order Paper
                that it is unlikely that we could complete the business in one
                day. I have therefore indicated that this will be a two-day
                sitting of the kind referred to in draft Standing Order No 12.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may be helpful if I clarify in advance how
                I intend to rule on the timing of any amendments, as referred to
                in the initial Standing Orders, which require amendments to be
                lodged</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;at least one hour prior to the
                commencement of the day’s business&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there are any amendments, I shall rule
                that lodgement will be required not one hour prior to
                commencement of the business on the Order Paper but prior to
                &quot;the day’s business&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As this is a two-day sitting, I will treat
                each day separately. That means that any amendments for today’s
                business should have been lodged by 9.30 this morning, and any
                amendments for tomorrow’s business must be lodged with my
                office before 9.30 tomorrow morning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the course of business today, tomorrow
                and in the future, Members may see me using headphones when
                Irish is being spoken. This is to provide me with an English
                translation so that I can fulfil my function of ensuring that
                all contributions, whether in English or in Irish, conform to
                the rules of the Assembly. The facility is available only to me
                and the Clerks. It does not pre-empt a decision on the question
                of simultaneous translation facilities for Members. That will be
                a matter for the Committee on Standing Orders and for the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I intend to use Erskine May for guidance on
                matters which arise during business in the Assembly or other
                matters on which I am asked to give a ruling and where the
                Initial Standing Orders and the draft Standing Orders are not
                clear or are insufficient.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the Assembly sitting on 9 November 1998 a
                Member expressed concern about the accuracy of the Official
                Report of the proceedings of 26&nbsp;October&nbsp;1998 in
                respect of a speech by another Member. I conducted a full,
                formal investigation. I interviewed those concerned, including
                the Editor of Debates, and reviewed the video recording and the
                notes made by Hansard staff. I am satisfied that the Official
                Report, as published, gives a proper account of the speech in
                question.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Doherty:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an apparent lack of will in certain
                circles to correct this inequitable situation.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Oh, East is East, and West is West, and
                never the twain shall meet&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That appears to be the philosophy that has
                directed so much of the strategic planning and regional
                development and which has brought Northern Ireland to its
                present confused condition. The signs are widespread, and the
                results are unfortunate, to say the least. Rail links have
                disappeared or been allowed to run to seed. A rail journey from
                Derry to Belfast is a depressing and lengthy ordeal. Motorways
                radiate in all directions from Belfast but come to a sudden halt
                after 20 or 30 miles. A motorist leaving Northern Ireland’s
                second city has to drive up to 50&nbsp;miles before reaching a
                motorway. This could not happen in any other part of Western
                Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We who live in the north or the west have to
                be content with an odd half-mile or so of dual carriageway or
                with a promise that in 10 or 20 years, if we behave ourselves,
                we will have a bypass or, in the case of Strabane, half of a
                bypass. The only power station in the whole north-west sector of
                this island is under sentence of death in the name of progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is just a taste of a condition that has
                been allowed to develop or even, some might say, actively
                promoted for a long time. The consequence of this infrastructure
                deficit, and of other factors that do not need to be stated
                here, is that a very large part of the north and west of
                Northern Ireland is seriously and unjustifiably disadvantaged.
                In respect of unemployment, poor health, poverty and social
                need, the constituencies and council districts of the north and
                west regularly come bottom, or close to bottom, of the list.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If inward investment happens, it is in spite
                of the existing infrastructure and some inertia in high places.
                It is more often the result of the efforts of dedicated
                individuals or bodies that have consistently promoted the
                talents, skills and energies of people who have proved time and
                time again that, in spite of political turmoil, violence and
                neglect, they can match the best if given the chance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are entering a new era of equality,
                equity, fairness and level playing fields. Northern Ireland is
                rising like a phoenix from the ashes — and the simile is
                deliberate. On the television set we see advertisements from a
                certain company extolling the virtues — efficiency,
                environmental friendliness and cost — of natural gas for homes
                and factories. What we are not told is that natural gas, with
                all its benefits of cost, cleanliness and efficiency, is not for
                us. The best we can expect is that we will be provided with more
                overpriced electricity — which we do not need — from an
                expensive, distant source.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equality — how are you? Fairness — cad é
                mar a tá tú? Level playing field — hoo aboot yeh ?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The exclusion of so much of Northern Ireland
                from the benefits of a natural gas supply raises serious
                questions of equity. If this persists it will cast doubts on the
                Government’s sincerity in declaring their concern about
                targeting areas of social need. This need will not be satisfied
                by the implementation of proposals to import electricity to
                Northern Ireland by way of a Scottish interconnector. People
                better informed than I have called this an anachronism. The
                reasons put forward to justify it are like John Cleese’s
                parrot — gone, dead, passed on, obsolete, defunct, over and
                done with. Would that it were, for it is a non-project.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, the dead parrot is being
                resurrected. The unnecessary project has been given the kiss of
                life by a British Minister — whoever pulls his strings — and
                revived by a Labour Minister whose argument is that market
                forces will bring prices down. All things being equal, that
                might be so. However, all things are not equal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hoped that we could have this debate before
                the recent announcement about the interconnector. That did not
                happen, and it is now all the more important that the Assembly
                and the country be made aware of the likely consequences. We
                must look this gift horse in the mouth very closely. There will
                be a slight reduction in the price of electricity — but at
                what cost? It is virtually copperfastening the inequity of the
                present situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Coolkeeragh, which as a natural gas power
                station could produce cheaply all the power we need, may be
                allowed to die. Industries, which for the first time could
                compete on almost equal terms, will suffer continuing injustice,
                and a large part of the North of Ireland will be left to wither
                while others prosper. That is too high a price to pay for a drop
                of imported Scotch.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having made the announcement about the
                interconnector and received a measure of support for it from
                some quarters, the Government may be happy to rest on their
                laurels, but they must not be allowed to do so, for Government
                laurels are all too often a bed of thorns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are very convincing economic and
                environmental reasons for extending gas provision. I have
                already mentioned the Coolkeeragh power station, which, if
                converted to use natural gas, would provide a substantial,
                anchored client base that would greatly improve the viability of
                the project.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government make much of the necessity to
                target areas of social need and of the need for policy appraisal
                and fair treatment. I would like to think that they are doing
                more than paying lip-service to those ideals. Up until now there
                has been little evidence of this in their reaction. A Cabinet
                study examined the question of wider provision of natural gas,
                but its brief was very narrow, being limited to consideration of
                the commercial feasibility of such an enterprise, and it
                concluded that without public funding it would not attract much
                interest from a commercial operator. I, with no commercial or
                business experience, could have said that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Government intervention is essential. Before
                proceeding further, the Government must carry out a
                comprehensive cost-benefit and socio-economic analysis that is
                wider in scope than the Caninus study — an analysis that takes
                account of all factors: economic, environmental, energy, equity
                and social need.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The absence of provision for gas puts a
                considerable section of Northern Ireland at a serious
                disadvantage in terms of attracting inward investment. Many
                established industries cannot compete on equal terms with more
                favoured eastern industries. Those living in regions with the
                highest level of social deprivation, with the highest
                unemployment and the lowest per-capita income, suffer further
                from having the most expensive fuel. It is not unreasonable to
                demand that the needs of less favoured areas in Northern Ireland
                be met in spite of the financial cost.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the Caninus study, commercial
                operators would put profits before philanthropy, but there are
                very strong reasons for the Government to show wider concern and
                subsidise the extension of natural gas beyond the Greater
                Belfast area. It is common world-wide for gas and other
                pipelines to be heavily supported by Governments. That is what
                happened with the pipeline from Scotland to Larne, and the gas
                network in Greater Belfast has benefited from EU grant aid. One
                argument for an extended pipeline is the recognised
                environmental, social and economic benefit that would be brought
                to an area which accounts for one fifth of the region’s
                population.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I close by drawing the Assembly’s attention
                to the commendable work of Group 22. Group&nbsp;22 is a
                partnership of district councils along the northern corridor
                stretching from Ballymena, through Ballymoney, the Coleraine
                triangle area, Moyle, Limavady, Derry and Strabane to Donegal.
                The partnership also includes business, industry and community
                interests. It transcends all divisions and is united in its
                determination to pursue this matter to a successful conclusion.
                It is supported by Northern Ireland’s three MEPs and leading
                economists and has enjoyed the encouragement of OFREG.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We expect a similar partnership of the
                various interest groups in the Assembly to act jointly and with
                determination on a matter which affects the well-being and the
                economic survival of a substantial proportion of the population
                across all social and political divides.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McClarty:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As an elected representative of East
                Londonderry I am perturbed by the lack of provision for a
                natural gas pipeline outside the Greater Belfast area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The big argument, of course, is that it would
                not be economically viable for the rest of the Province to be
                served without subvention. But it was not economically viable to
                bring the pipeline to Northern Ireland in the first place
                without subvention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government Paper ‘Shaping Our Future’
                stresses the importance of developing the northern corridor.
                Such development must obviously include economic development,
                and without the provision of natural gas to the north-west, the
                people there will be seriously disadvantaged as industry moves
                to where energy is cheapest. The supply of gas to the northern
                corridor is inextricably linked to the future of Coolkeeragh
                power station. Coolkeeragh will close between 2002 and 2004.
                Given the time necessary for planning and constructing a
                pipeline, it is clear that the decision on any future generation
                activity at Coolkeeragh cannot be delayed much longer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a new station is to be constructed, it is
                critical that a decision on the extension of the gas network to
                the north and north-west be made now. The decisions about the
                gas pipeline and the power station depend on one another, and I
                urge those with influence to reach those decisions at the
                earliest possible date.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of Northern Ireland’s unemployment
                black spots are in the north and the north-west, and without the
                provision of natural gas the situation can only worsen. The area
                I represent is happy to compete with any other area for inward
                investment, but the competition must be on an equal footing so
                that we in the north and the north-west are not seriously
                disadvantaged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wholeheartedly support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support what has been said by Mr A Doherty
                and Mr McClarty, who represent East Londonderry. As a Member for
                Foyle and Londonderry, I come from an area which is socially
                deprived — indeed, it has the highest unemployment in Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a pity that the Minister is not here
                for this debate. If he had taken all the issues on board, the
                decision on the Scottish interconnector would not have been
                made. So many Ministers are leaving so much to the Assembly that
                one wonders why he did not leave this decision to us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everybody knows the history of natural gas
                coming to Northern Ireland. It was very much decided by Europe
                and, of course, by the Government. Europe has provided almost
                £45 million, and the Government £14&nbsp;million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to thank Group 22, for it is the
                engine that has driven this matter forward. Natural gas in the
                north and the north-west would affect 300,000 people. It is sad
                that only after Group 22, which represents eight councils in
                Northern Ireland and a wide range of businesses in the north and
                north-west, and after a group of industrialists had submitted a
                report, did the Minister and Department of Economic Development
                decide to have a feasibility study carried out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When one looks at how that study was
                initiated, one sees that the Northern Ireland Office broke every
                rule. Indeed, it even broke some European regulations when it
                decided to go ahead. The Northern Ireland Office looked only at
                the financial and economic implications; it did not look at the
                wider economic issues that the north and north-west of the
                Province will face if natural gas does not come.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this moment the Government have no plans
                whatsoever to connect the rest of the Province to natural gas.
                But at least Group 22 has set the bandwagon rolling by getting
                them to produce this study. However, we all knew that the study,
                because its remit was so narrow, would tell us that it would not
                be economically viable to bring natural gas to the rest of the
                Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, only part of the report was
                made public. Part of it remains secret to this day, for whatever
                reason. It would have been interesting for the Members of the
                Assembly, as public representatives, to see the full report as
                Caninus, the company employed by the Government to conduct the
                economic reappraisal, initially stated that it would be
                important, both environmentally and financially, for natural gas
                to come to the north and north-west of the Province. However,
                Caninus was not allowed to consider the wider issues. This is
                clear when one examines the report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposal to bring natural gas to the
                Province was supported by the eight relevant district councils
                represented here, by the three Northern Ireland MEPs and by
                several Members of Parliament. This is an issue that has
                cross-community support in the north and north-west of the
                Province, and it has the support of all the political parties.
                It is a voice that the Government cannot silence. It is
                important for economic, social, environmental and other reasons
                that natural gas come to the north and north-west.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very important that Group 22 be allowed
                to continue its work. The Department of Economic Development is
                currently considering a further Group 22 report, which answers
                some of the points raised in the report of the Department of
                Economic Development. I welcome this development and hope to see
                a very quick response to Group 22.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another serious issue is the gradual rundown
                of Coolkeeragh power station, which is to close by the year 2004
                when its contract runs out. I am afraid that Coolkeeragh will
                close before 2004. An important related issue is that of jobs.
                Although Coolkeeragh is being run down, no one in the plant
                knows exactly what is happening. Coolkeeragh is the only large
                power station in the north-west, yet the Department of Economic
                Development did not allow Caninus to look at the possibility of
                its being changed from oil to natural gas, as happened at
                Ballylumford — a change which was welcomed by everyone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Coolkeeragh were changed from oil to
                natural gas it could easily take 80% of the load that is coming
                through the pipes. Such a change was not considered by the study
                undertaken by the Department of Economic Development. It would
                probably take £73 million per year for the natural gas pipeline
                to be run from Belfast to the north and north-west.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One has to ask why the Department study did
                not consider all the main issues. Coolkeeragh could become the
                main beneficiary of natural gas coming to the north and
                north-west. Why did the Department not consult with the major
                industries and business people in the area? One can only assume
                that it was because of other issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important for the life of the power
                station, for the workers there and for the whole industry that
                the Government reconsider these matters and come up with ideas
                that have the support of Assembly Members. It is morally right
                that natural gas should come to the north and north-west of the
                Province, as well as to the Greater Belfast area.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McLaughlin:</p>

                reiterate my complete support for the comments of Colleagues in
                addressing this issue and in particular for the activities of
                Group 22 in bringing the matter before us.</p>
                <i>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed natural gas line to the Greater
                Belfast area raises serious concerns which should engage the
                attention of Northern Ireland Office Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am baffled as to how the decision could be
                justified in terms of social and economic disparities and
                against policy appraisal and fair treatment and targeting social
                needs criteria.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do not the domestic consumers of the northern
                corridor have an equal right to gas-fired central heating and to
                cleaner fuel and cheaper energy? Clearly they do. Do not
                schools, hospitals, business, industry and manufacturing
                concerns in the north-west have the same absolute right as
                similar concerns in Greater Belfast? Clearly they do, and we
                must ask how this decision was taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any region can suffer economic decline and
                deprivation, but disparities within regions, and particularly in
                a region as truncated as the Six Counties, are often a
                consequence of deliberate policy and practice. That must stop.
                If the peace process and the Assembly are about anything, they
                are about stopping practices which have created the disparities
                between regions that are less than 25 miles apart.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not an accident when proximate areas
                have widely varying statistics. Unemployment in some areas is
                among the lowest in Europe while 25 or 30 miles away there is a
                region with the highest of unemployment in western Europe. The
                disparity between the areas east and west of the Bann is so well
                documented that no one would attempt to deny it. There is an
                incontrovertible need for an end to programmes that have created
                such conditions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Coolkeeragh power station will be closed in
                the next few years unless there is a change of policy on power
                generation and energy supply in the North. Coolkeeragh is coming
                to the end of its useful life, and it needs conversion and
                investment programmes. A decision to extend the natural gas
                pipeline to the north-west would provide both impetus and
                economic rationale for conversion to a gas-fired turbine
                generation plant. The future of the plant and that of the highly
                skilled workforce would be secure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The options have not been fully explored, and
                there has been no credible explanation for that. The fact that a
                feasibility report has been kept secret fully justifies the
                concerns of my fellow Assembly Member for Foyle. There is no
                good reason for the Government not to share their political and
                economic intelligence on this matter. The issue is
                controversial. It is important for the north-west to have a
                level playing field that will enable us to help ourselves and
                rebuild the economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The case for the provision of a natural gas
                supply has been well made. The difficulty is that it has been
                made in a selective and preferential manner that will perpetuate
                the process of disadvantage between the areas east and areas
                west of the Bann. I welcome the cross-community and cross-party
                support for reversing that policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As well as proposing the delivery of a
                natural gas supply through the Greater Belfast area, we could
                consider the existence of a natural gas supply on this island.
                If we were to discuss the possibility of bringing both projects
                together we could address many of the concerns about the
                cross-border elements of economic strategy for the north-west
                region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly should take the opportunity to
                call on the Minister to defer a definitive decision on the
                matter and to order a full, open and transparent reappraisal of
                all the options and report back to the Assembly. Fair play
                demands that. I hope that the Assembly will support Group 22 in
                its efforts; will support the workforce in Coolkeeragh; will
                support the communities in the northern corridor and the
                north-west; and will support links between east and west and
                between north and south — namely, a gas pipeline that has its
                conjunction in the north-west area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly should make clear to the
                mandarins in the Northern Ireland Office and the civil servants
                responsible for this pernicious decision and for the policy
                which has affected the region for so long — that Members are
                not pleased and want the matter re-examined.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of the Alliance Party I welcome
                this motion. Perhaps the issue should have been discussed a few
                weeks ago, before Mr Ingram’s decision. However, I am pleased
                that Members are discussing it and that cross-party consensus
                has been achieved. For once, I agree with 90% of what Members
                have said, though it is a pity that they are all from the north
                and the north west. I believe that this project will have an
                impact beyond County Derry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned that the Minister decided so
                speedily to proceed with the Scottish interconnector, just when
                a lobby seemed to be building up for other options to be looked
                at. Every other serious issue which has arisen in recent months
                has been &quot;parked&quot; by the appropriate Minister. The
                Assembly will have to decide on education reform, the future of
                health and personal social services, waste management and the
                regional plan, but this decision was rushed through as if it
                could not be left for the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The decision may well be in the interests of
                power generators in Scotland, but I am unconvinced that the
                electricity interconnector is in the interests of people in
                Northern Ireland, especially those living in the most deprived
                areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Doherty and others highlighted the
                interests of the north-west. In the context of this pipeline,
                let Members remember how far the north west extends. I represent
                South Antrim, which some people think is suburban, yet two
                thirds of South Antrim will not have natural gas under the
                current proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If I have one criticism of Group 22 it is
                that they seem to have forgotten that Antrim also exists. It is
                the gap on the map between Belfast, where there is gas, and
                Ballymena, where they want to put it; Antrim is a fairly
                substantial town.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that the option to upgrade
                Coolkeeragh would ensure the viability of a pipeline for all of
                the north and north-west. I want to see both Derry and
                Letterkenny benefiting from the jobs which would be created, but
                I also want to see that benefit in Limavady, Coleraine,
                Ballymoney, Ballymena, Antrim and maybe even Ballyclare,
                depending on the route taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was news last Friday of the potential
                loss of 1,000 jobs resulting from the takeover of Daewoo. The
                factories in Antrim and Carrickfergus are under threat.
                Therefore, when talking of the needs for economic development,
                Members must ensure the focus is not too narrow. Areas which are
                supposedly doing well also have considerable need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In that context, the pipeline will benefit
                20% of the population of Northern Ireland, not just the 10% who
                live in the north-west.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ingram’s decision to support the plan
                for an electricity interconnector will have three effects. It
                will damage the environment in east Antrim, which already has a
                higher than normal number of electricity pylons per acre; it
                will damage the economy, especially in the poorer areas of the
                north-west, but also in Northern&nbsp;Ireland as a whole; and it
                will undermine the whole idea of a strategic energy supply, for
                the whole Province will be relying on three sites situated
                within a few miles of each other — two in Islandmagee and one
                at Kilroot.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This decision does not represent the best
                economic option, for it will require a vast amount of EU
                funding. By contrast, the proposed gas pipeline to Derry would
                help to improve Coolkeeragh power station, would produce a real
                diversity of energy provision — certainly for
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland and, possibly, for the whole of the north
                of the island — would create jobs at Coolkeeragh and,
                indirectly in other industries, and would be less harmful to the
                environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week, the regional strategic plan was
                launched. Among the key objectives of this report are plans for
                the development of core centres. But this plan has undermined
                all of those objectives. People in Westminster and Whitehall
                spoke recently about &quot;joined-up Government&quot;, but we
                seem to have the least joined-up Government imaginable. One
                Minister seems to be making a decision which totally contradicts
                the plans to be announced by one of his colleagues in a few
                weeks’ time. We will not have joined-up government until the
                Assembly takes on proper powers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ingram has agreed to meet a delegation to
                discuss the Coolkeeragh option in a few weeks’ time. When he
                meets that group I hope that he will take the opportunity to
                remove his blinkers and look at the real energy needs of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fully support the motion. There should not
                be any difference in the supplies of fuel or energy to any part
                of Northern&nbsp;Ireland. My constituency of North Down could be
                seen as forming part of the Greater Belfast area. The extent of
                roadworks in the Holywood area suggests that that is where the
                pipeline is to be, and no doubt my constituents will benefit
                from it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That does not prevent me from supporting the
                calls by those who represent other areas of the Province,
                particularly those with high unemployment where people need
                cheaper and more efficient forms of fuel, and where it would be
                beneficial to the local economic infrastructure to have cheaper
                and more efficient fuel supplies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish that, when there is some
                cross-community consensus on an issue, some of the other parties
                would stop wallowing in paranoiac victimhood based on what has
                happened in the past. If the east of the Province traditionally
                had better levels of employment, it was because, during the 19th
                century, heavy industries, such as shipbuilding or the
                manufacture of equipment for the weaving and spinning
                industries, such as was carried out at Mackie’s factory, were
                all based in the areas of highest population density. It had
                little to do with whether communities were Nationalist or
                Unionist, but was based on the location of specific industries,
                the availability of imported steel, and other factors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us stop wallowing in the past, rolling
                about in our victimhood and ascribing all sorts of natural and
                economic phenomena to some paranoiac vision of people plotting
                to disadvantage others. We should act together for the benefit
                of every citizen.</p>

                treatment in the provision of both fuel facilities and services,
                but stop this nonsense of assigning them on the basis of some
                ancient wrong, some wound that must be kept open by being
                constantly picked at. We must start directing our minds to the
                most effective and efficient way of tackling the problems of the
                entire Province, regardless of nationality and political
                aspirations, and do the best we can.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are now reaching the stage where, as in
                the past, so in the present, industry, big business and
                entrepreneurial activity are all dictating where certain
                operations are created and the areas they are intended to
                service. I have no doubt that the Greater Belfast area was
                chosen for natural gas because it has the highest concentration
                of people who can be serviced easily and quickly, and so it can
                provide the most efficient return to those investing in that
                business venture.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is the Government’s function to control
                big business and operations such as this to ensure that they are
                not permitted purely to exploit that which brings the biggest
                profit and to ignore the social, economic, industrial and
                employment requirements of the entire Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For those reasons the Assembly must look
                after the interests of all the people of Northern Ireland. And
                in this regard, since this pipeline is coming into Belfast, I
                raise again the question of the Belfast port. I refute the
                suggestion that we can have improvements to our roads and
                transport system if we sell off the port at a cut price — once
                again, to entrepreneurs and businessmen who, behind the scenes,
                are already lining up substantial profits for themselves —
                regardless of whether it is in the best interests of the entire
                community.</p>

                researchers to put forward a case to counter the arguments of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The basic point of the motion is to ensure
                that we limit and control business and entrepreneurial
                exploitation of the Northern Ireland market over a range of
                matters — for example, supermarkets, the supply of gas, the
                supply of transport systems, the ports and the regulations that
                will control the rates to be paid on imported goods. We must do
                that on the basis of what is best for all the people of Northern
                Ireland and not on what, in immediate terms, serves the
                interests of the profiteers.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the risk of breaking up this very cosy and
                welcome cross-party consensus, I will introduce one or two
                caveats to the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Doherty stressed, quite rightly, the
                desirability of cheaper electricity, but that is not necessarily
                what we would get by extending the gas pipeline. We must look
                ahead a little on this subject.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Current estimates are that the United Kingdom
                will become a net importer of gas by 2010 at the latest. There
                are other sources of gas in Europe, but they are in places such
                as Siberia and Algeria where the level of political instability
                leaves our problems some way behind. I am not sure that we
                should put so many eggs into that particular basket. No
                significant finds of gas have been made around these islands,
                and that takes into account the drilling off the Skerries near
                Portrush.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another fuel is readily available to us —
                lignite, or ‘green coal’. Members may not be surprised to
                learn that the main source of lignite is near Ballymoney, in my
                constituency. The key point is that the cost of generating
                electricity from lignite is about 2.7p per kilowatt, while the
                current average cost of electricity in Northern Ireland is about
                4p per kilowatt. Extrapolated into the future, the supply of
                green coal is expected to last for at least 100 years. If we
                have to start buying gas from places further afield in Europe,
                we will have no real idea what the price is likely to be. We
                would be hooking into a source of fuel for our electricity whose
                price we could not control.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposal to open-mine green coal was made
                eight years ago by Nikitara Minerals. Originally it was looking
                for considerable Government assistance for the project, as is
                the case with the proposal for a north-west gas pipeline.
                However, the company recently formed a partnership that would
                allow it to finance the project itself. It is no longer looking
                for a subvention to get the project going.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before privatisation, Northern Ireland
                Electricity’s stated aim was to generate electricity from one
                third oil, one third coal and one third lignite. Since
                privatisation, those parameters have been changed, and the
                proposal to use green coal has been dropped. The planned
                interconnector with Scotland actually enhances the argument for
                using green coal. In that situation, Nikitara Minerals could
                sell the excess electricity to the grid and it could be sold
                back to Scotland when Scotland has a supply shortage. There is a
                complementary circle in that method of providing electricity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other factor, which I think motivated
                Nikitara Minerals in its most recent proposal and in its joint
                venture with Meekatharra, is that from next year EU regulations
                will enforce a free market in electricity. Northern Ireland
                Electricity may find it more difficult to propagate its current
                cosy monopoly. Both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland
                need more electricity; the supply is uneven. It is a question of
                when electricity needs to be pumped into the grid. An efficient
                grid is required so that electricity can be moved around.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the main objections to the opencast
                mining of green coal is environmental, and everyone needs to
                focus on the way in which environmental arguments are advanced.
                The environmental lobby has been very effective. Mineral
                extraction companies now know that they can no any longer get
                away with the slash and burn approach that they have pursued for
                many years. Environmental concerns are expected to be uppermost
                in their calculations, and they are constantly required to
                repair the damage that they have caused. When they finish, they
                have to leave the environment as good or better than it was when
                they found it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is entirely clear to Meekathurra
                Minerals. The firm knows that it cannot just lay waste to a huge
                swathe of land between Ballymoney and Stranocum and do nothing
                about it. It feels that it will be easily able to afford to
                replace the terrain and to blend in the area where there has
                been extraction with the natural environment. It would be
                ridiculous to grant it a licence to mine without very strict
                stipulations about that, and the firm expects that to be a part
                of the negotiations for its licence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Moyle part of my constituency there is
                over 15% unemployment, and unless we get better weather or more
                tourists, this figure can only go up. We have just lost jobs, as
                have Members representing the Londonderry area, in the
                manufacturing sector. Unfortunately we are in a global market,
                and one of the key costs, apart from labour, is the supply of
                energy. It is critical that we find the best way of providing
                cheaper electricity on a lasting basis in order to preserve
                manufacturing jobs, wherever they may be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be a great boost to the area that I
                represent to know that we had 1200 construction jobs for three
                years to build an electricity generating plant, and then in the
                region of 200 or 300 jobs to carry out the mining. That would
                enable us to provide a constant supply of electricity at a price
                which could be negotiated in such a way as to be fixed for a
                protracted period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the pipeline is worthy of detailed
                examination, and may well prove to be a worthwhile venture, the
                most pressing need at the moment is to find a method of
                providing cheaper electricity. And we could do that much more
                quickly, and at no cost to the public purse, if we were to give
                our support to Meekathurra Minerals to develop the green coal
                site in the Stranocum area.</p>

                blackspot of the North of Ireland. We have to be able to offer

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. Mr Leslie’s speech
                was an interesting diversion, but we need to come back to the
                real world and try to ensure that we have an adequate energy
                supply across the Province — and not only an adequate energy
                supply, but one that is within the reach of the entire
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to dwell on two central issues. A
                number of people have mentioned the population that will be
                excluded if the interconnector and the gas pipeline reach only
                the Greater Belfast area. The numbers are approximately 300,000,
                about 20% of the population of Northern Ireland, which just
                happens to be approximately the population of the city of
                Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not contend that the population of
                Antrim, which, as Mr Ford has reminded us, is in the northern
                corridor, right through Ballymena, Ballymoney, Coleraine and
                Limavady to Londonderry is of the same density as that of the
                city of Belfast. Of course, it is not, but numerically it is
                roughly the same.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, can you imagine the outcry if the city
                of Belfast were to be excluded from the provision of a natural
                gas pipeline? Of course, it would not be contemplated. Secondly,
                Members should put down a marker to the Minister regarding the
                rationale for this. If an interconnector were up and running and
                there were a marginal reduction in the price of electricity to
                all domestic and commercial consumers, that, of course, would be
                welcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regulator, Mr&nbsp;McIldoon, has made a
                considerable effort to keep prices down, but obviously there are
                factors outside his remit that have prevented prices being
                reduced even further.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, the Greater Belfast area would
                have an alternative energy supply — natural gas — which
                would be just as competitive. Many argue that it would be even
                more competitive. Inward investors would have an option.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should not try to divide the Assembly. I
                and other Members who represent the north and the north-west do
                not decry the Greater Belfast area for getting a natural gas
                pipeline. It is commendable that that should happen, and as many
                people as possible should make use of it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, if the Greater Belfast area can
                provide inward investors not only with cheaper electricity but
                also with the option of cheaper gas, it follows that it will
                have an even greater commercial advantage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If it is difficult to attract industry to,
                for example, Coleraine at present, it will be almost impossible
                to do so if there is an option to go to a location where a
                natural gas pipeline offers an even greater incentive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference has been made to the document ‘Shaping
                our Future’, which I am sure the Assembly will analyse and
                pass judgement on. If that is used as the base, a natural gas
                pipeline is a prerequisite for places in the northern corridor
                such as Ballymena, Coleraine and Londonderry to prosper, improve
                economically and become viable units for the people who live
                there. But this cannot be done if an interconnector offers an
                unnatural disadvantage to only one segment of the population.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and hope that, in the
                near future, Members can persuade the Minister to provide the
                wherewithal to extend a natural gas pipeline beyond the Greater
                Belfast area.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McElduff:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Cheann Comhairle, Mr&nbsp;Initial Presiding
                Officer, Ba mhaith liomsa mo thacaíocht don rún seo a chur in-iúl.
                Is ábhar fíor-thábhachtach é seo, agus cuirim fáilte roimh
                an seans an díospóireacht a fhorbairt.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a Member for West Tyrone, I commend this
                motion and add my voice to those arguing for the provision of
                natural gas to the north-west and to other areas outside Greater
                Belfast. I see the need for this debate to transcend the narrow
                confines of energy policy. Wider economic, social and equality
                arguments must be allowed to influence this decision-making
                process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Fein believes that social and economic
                need must govern the decision. Ivan&nbsp;Barr, the chairperson
                of Strabane District Council, contacted me about this on Friday,
                and he outlined how important it is to residents in that area
                also.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The north-west, which includes at least
                Derry, Strabane, Fermanagh, Omagh, County Donegal and Limavady,
                has long been characterised by social and economic disadvantage.
                Unemployment is comparatively high. The region scores badly on
                deprivation indicators across a spectrum of moral, social and
                economic variables, of which unemployment is one. It is not a
                figment of our imagination — and on that I take issue with
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney, who is not in the Chamber. The area suffers
                from a legacy of peripheral and economic discrimination, which
                was very real in the nineteenth century and has continued in the
                latter part of the twentieth century.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ar an ábhar sin, tá fadhb an-mhór againn
                sna ceanntracha seo ó thaobh dí-fhostaíochta de, chomh maith
                le gnéithe sóisialta eile, agus caithfear rud éigin a
                dhéanamh faoi seo.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposal to extend the availability of
                natural gas to the north-west must be considered under agreed
                policy objectives such as targeting social need, cross-border
                co-operation and local economic development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The stated priorities of TSN are to target
                resources on people and areas in greatest need, to reduce
                differentials, remove inequality and give people equal rights.
                The inequality between the north-west and the north-east would
                undoubtedly be increased if natural gas were confined to the
                Greater Belfast area. The former would suffer further
                disadvantage and peripherality if gas were made available only
                in Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a social and economic imperative and
                a direct connection between the availability of suitable energy
                supplies and the competitiveness of an area with regard to
                inward investment and economic development. Natural gas would
                certainly bring benefits to the north-west. It would enhance the
                area’s competitive position and help immeasurably towards
                creating real jobs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, if gas is not available the area
                will suffer decline in business and job numbers. It will be
                ruled out in terms of attracting some types of industry,
                particularly large energy users. The denial of a supply would
                place the north-west at an even bigger disadvantage in relation
                to other parts of the North and the island as a whole which have
                the benefit of gas. It would seriously reduce the area’s
                inward-investment performance — something that we can ill
                afford.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have concentrated on social and economic
                need. If that matter is addressed, and if gas is made available,
                the domestic-energy user will enjoy substantial savings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other relevant factors include cross-border
                co-operation and the avoidance of duplication between Donegal
                and the part of the north-west to which I have referred, and
                which is located within the Six-County state. There is a real
                national, regional and European dimension to this matter.
                Alleviating the effects of peripherality, developing internal
                networks and an energy infrastructure, fulfilling EU funding
                criteria should not be ignored.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to act decisively on this matter.
                Coolkeeragh power station should become the cornerstone of a new
                integrated gas-to-electricity power project for the north-west.
                The benefits of that would be social, economic and
                environmental, and they would be national in character. Failure
                to extend the availability of natural gas would be viewed by
                many as a further act of inequality and discrimination. I call
                on everyone to support the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Agus níor mhaith liom mórán eile a rá,
                ach amháin go mbaineann an cheist seo le comhionannas agus le

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Presiding Officer, you have a distinct
                advantage over the rest of us because you have that earpiece.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a Member from the east of the Province, I
                support the motion. I am grateful to Mr&nbsp;Doherty for raising
                the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlike Mr McCartney, I have to refer to the
                past because the issue of a natural gas pipeline was initiated
                in the early 1970s and was ongoing throughout that time. For
                part of that period I was chairman of Belfast City Council gas
                committee. We attempted to persuade Mrs&nbsp;Thatcher’s
                Government to provide a gas pipeline from Great&nbsp;Britain to
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, but we were unsuccessful. This defeats
                the idea that Belfast was being favourably treated. As a
                consequence the rest of the Province was denied a pipeline as
                well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government negotiated with the Irish
                Government to provide a pipeline from Kinsale to
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. The idea was to bring it to Belfast first
                and then distribute it throughout the Province. Even though they
                had spent over £5 million in pipelaying from Dundalk up to the
                Border, the Government, without any notice, decided that that
                was going to be abandoned. Two or three weeks before it happened
                Mr&nbsp;Adam&nbsp;Butler looked across from Portstewart into the
                sunset and said &quot;There is the new gasworks&quot;. A few
                weeks later that whole concept was abandoned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that time I was made Chairman of the
                Northern Ireland Gas Employers Board which represented all 13 of
                the gas undertakings in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, including the one
                in Derry. We formed an alliance with the trade union and
                produced our own plan. We proposed bringing natural gas from
                Kinsale into the Belfast area, to develop it there — because
                the population was there — and then to bring it to all other
                parts of the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had the finance in place, and all we asked
                from the Government was their blessing for the scheme. They did
                not give it. On another Good Friday, in 1985, they took the
                decision to close the gas industry down in spite of the fact
                that it took £250&nbsp;million to do so. The price of the
                pipeline was estimated at £50&nbsp;million so it cost them five
                times as much to close the pipeline than to build it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. As Mr&nbsp;Doherty
                said, there are good economic and environmental reasons. People
                in Northern&nbsp;Ireland — who are part of the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom irrespective of which part they live in or
                whether they recognise it or not — ought to share in natural
                gas, which is a national asset.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s decision is not good. The
                Assembly will have to address this issue at some stage because a
                decision to provide a pipeline to supply gas to all the people
                of Northern&nbsp;Ireland will have to be taken.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems that gas has already been introduced
                into the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bell’s history of the gas industry in
                Northern Ireland is correct. In the early 1970s
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland had a gas supply, and the relevance of
                that is very important today. It is important for the
                regeneration of all of the towns between Belfast and Derry and
                urgent in order to prevent the closure of Coolkerragh Power
                Station within a few years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is incomprehensible that we have to deal
                with arguments against a European grid which will deprive the
                rest of Northern&nbsp;Ireland of a natural gas pipeline. The
                disturbing news at the weekend that 2,000&nbsp;people are to
                lose their jobs at Fruit of the Loom and Desmonds, on both sides
                of the border in the north-west, makes this issue even more
                urgent and critical.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McClarty and I recently represented
                Coleraine on a visit to several cities in the United States, and
                it became clear that towns and cities without a proper
                infrastructure, without a proper power supply, without proper
                roads, railways and airports et cetera, are not attractive to
                business and the availability of natural gas is an obvious
                prerequisite to enable the issue of equality to be addressed in
                the north-west.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have been reprimanded for daring to refer
                to past neglect. However, it is important that history is not
                repeated. We have to learn from past mistakes so that they are
                not repeated and people are not marginalised or disadvantaged by
                accident or design either by Government policies or by the
                policies of the private sector, which is increasingly being
                called upon to provide the capital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Natural gas is the power of the twenty-first
                century. There is no doubt about that. It is clean, economical
                and a key factor in decisions about industrial location. We
                cannot separate the economic and the social arguments. They go
                hand in hand and cannot be ignored. We have to target social
                need. The Assembly is right to debate this issue and to impress
                upon the Government and those charged with the provision of
                natural gas to the Greater Belfast area that they must not
                become a new body which will discriminate against people because
                of geographical location. The Assembly has an important role to
                play in imposing controls on the private sector whether over the
                supply of natural gas, the location of supermarkets, or any
                other critical aspects of life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The arguments against the pipeline are not
                valid and they ignore the fact that large subsidies have already
                been provided to bring gas to Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Why not
                apply the same principles and bring gas to Coolkeeragh and to
                the other towns that have been mentioned this morning?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be a bad start for the Assembly if
                it were incapable of influencing the economic well-being of the
                north in a way which is seen to be just and fair. It is
                regrettable that decisions continue to be made without the
                Assembly’s having had the opportunity to consider them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The provision of gas to the north and
                north-west would give some hope to those 2,000&nbsp;people who
                will become unemployed. It would attract new industries to
                replace those that are leaving. The supply of natural gas is
                essential — a must — and needs Government intervention now,
                not some time in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lignite and green coal can be discussed at
                any time, but this issue is critical: I believe that there is a
                move to ensure that the gas pipeline does not extend beyond the
                Greater Belfast area. That would be a major disappointment for
                Antrim, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Limavady, Derry, Strabane and
                Donegal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">References were made earlier to the Kinsale
                pipeline, which, sadly, did not come north. There is no reason
                for Ireland’s not having an integrated gas supply, for not
                finishing the work that was started in the 70s. We are part of
                Europe, and a fundamental principle is to create economic grids
                across Europe and beyond.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The social and economic considerations have
                been well highlighted here today. Reference has already been
                made to the important study carried out by Group 22. That study
                was welcome, and it was supported by every district council
                along the northern corridor, irrespective of politics.</p>

                totally outside the remit of the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion draws attention to the lack of
                natural gas provision outside the Greater&nbsp;Belfast area.
                Mr&nbsp;Leslie said earlier that he wished to inject some sanity
                into the debate. He failed because this is not a debate about
                cheaper forms of energy such as lignite. The debate is about the
                lack of a gas pipeline to parts of Northern Ireland outside the
                Greater Belfast area. Some Members believe, because the debate
                is about natural gas, that that gives them the opportunity to
                talk a lot of hot air. It does not and we should keep within the
                terms of the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those Members who have introduced other
                issues should perhaps declare their interest when it comes to
                talking about lignite and the development of land, especially in
                areas of Ballymoney.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government have facilitated the
                introduction of a natural gas network throughout the Greater
                Belfast area by issuing licences to Belfast Gas plc and to its
                subsidiary, Phoenix Natural Gas. By contrast, the Government
                have not outlined any plans for natural gas to be made available
                to areas outside Greater Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard a lot about Group 22, which was
                formed over a year ago in response to the realisation that if
                people in the north, north-west and north-east did not get
                together they would be excluded from the decision-making
                process. We should look at what it would mean if those areas
                were excluded from the development of the gas pipeline. First,
                they have a population well in excess of 370,000 — more than
                20% of Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s population — and encompass
                27% to 30% of its land area. We would therefore be excluding a
                large proportion of the population from the benefits of natural
                gas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome Mr&nbsp;Ford’s comment that we
                should be looking at this matter much beyond the north and
                north-west areas. Members have said that it involves many other
                areas of the Province — indeed, it is about having equality
                throughout the Province. The people of the north-east and
                north-west have suffered badly in the past when they have been
                ignored prior to decisions being taken. Those people should be
                included when taking decisions about the future of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people have spoken about how the
                decision to stop natural gas from coming to these areas will
                result in further unemployment. In my constituency, Moyle has an
                unemployment rate of 14·7%, and when one combines the districts
                of Ballymena, Ballymoney and Moyle, one finds that these areas
                account for 6% of Northern Ireland’s unemployed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that the unemployed have certain
                needs and deserve equality of treatment, and I hope it is
                realised that the exclusion of the north, north-east, the
                north-west and other areas of Northern&nbsp;Ireland from natural
                gas further disadvantages those people. The detrimental effects
                of the absence of gas in those areas will, of course, be
                compounded by its presence in Greater&nbsp;Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all have to ensure that the north,
                north-west and north-east do not become economic backwaters that
                are even more peripheral. Furthermore, existing local industries
                would be placed at a competitive disadvantage, the east coast
                corridor would be further enhanced, existing socio-economic
                differentials would be widened and substantial environmental
                benefits for this area would be lost.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How would the Government feel if they were a
                potential industrial investor in this part of Northern Ireland
                looking at the circumstances of that area? Would council areas
                such as Coleraine, Ballymena, Ballymoney or Antrim be able to
                attract investors on the same basis as Belfast or some of the
                council areas around the Greater Belfast area which will have
                natural gas? They would be unable to do so, and would therefore
                be further disadvantaged. We must move away from such a
                situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The absence of natural gas will have an
                adverse effect on local economic development, there will be a
                failure to promote local economic growth and an increase in
                unemployment. The area will become peripheral, and a level
                economic playing field will not exist.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a major thrust by the Confederation

                Belfast-Dublin economic corridor. The Assembly should look at
                that proposal in conjunction with the proposal for the increase
                of natural gas to the rest of Northern&nbsp;Ireland. A sustained
                focus on the Belfast – Dublin economic corridor will further
                exacerbate the peripheral nature of the north, west, and border
                counties of the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members should be pulling together to work
                for Ulster instead of putting forward economic proposals for the

                the Republic of Ireland. Members should be working for the
                benefit of people in all areas of the Province including the
                Greater Belfast area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Substantial environmental benefits will be
                lost if gas is not extended to the rest of the Province.
                Consumers will not have an equal choice of energy sources, and
                the much-vaunted liberalisation of energy policies will not have
                provided the benefits enjoyed by consumers in the Greater
                Belfast area and much of the European Union.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government have put the environment at
                the heart of their policies, and the Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                Housing Executive has designated gas as its preferred fuel for
                the future. How can the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Housing Executive
                deliver on that policy agenda when the north-west, with 24% of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s housing stock, will not have gas
                available?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly should note that in those needy
                areas, and for those people of the north, the north-west and the
                north-east, the gas project will create about 2,000&nbsp;job
                years of employment and save the consumer more than
                £10&nbsp;million per year by the year 2000. That startling
                figure is a guaranteed figure and not some projected figure. It
                is the figure that Coopers&nbsp;and&nbsp;Lybrand and
                Price&nbsp;Waterhouse have put forward in their in-depth study
                on targeting social need. In the report the consultants said</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The failure to extend the gas pipeline
                to the north and north-west of this Province would, we believe,
                be difficult to defend in terms of the new targeting social need
                policy.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government have a responsibility to get
                on with ensuring that there is a level playing field for the
                providers of natural gas, not only in the Greater&nbsp;Belfast
                area — which I am glad to see — but across the Province. The
                experts back this proposal for natural gas, as do the
                politicians, so far as we can see. I hope that the voice of the
                Assembly will be added to the call for the provision of natural
                gas across Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Such a development would
                ensure that everyone in the Province would have an equal share
                in the benefits that natural gas would bring.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Cheann Comhairle, I support the motion, and
                I support Group 22 in its campaign to extend the gas pipeline to
                areas outside of Belfast, especially to areas west of the Bann,
                part of which I represent. There are great benefits, especially
                to rural areas, from a cheaper fuel source. The availability of
                gas is an issue of equality. We have a right to have the same
                access to cheaper fuel as people in any other part of the Six
                Counties, to produce and have energy that can be used to help
                bring economic benefit to our areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are energy savings to be made. The
                economic progress of our area depends on access to cheaper fuel
                in the future. There are also environmental benefits for the
                future to be considered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reducing peripherality is another aspect of
                our constant fight. We who live west of the Bann have a battle
                on our hands every week, year in and year out, to defend our
                areas against job losses and against the continued pressure for
                jobs to be moved to Belfast and other built-up areas. Quite a
                lot of this seems to have to do with mindsets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney spoke of people wallowing in the
                past. In the last nine years there has been inward investment of
                only some several million pounds to Fermanagh/South Tyrone out
                of a total inward investment amount of £379&nbsp;million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently £87&nbsp;million was allocated for
                road structures, restructuring and infrastructure, and Fermanagh
                got absolutely nothing. I am not speaking of the past. That was
                our future just a few years ago, and that is now the present. I
                am stating facts, just as other people state facts about those
                areas. We are not talking about the past or about hundreds of
                years ago. We are talking about the present, and we want it to
                change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that there is change because
                that concerns equality, and we want equality on the economic
                side. There is also the business of political clout. Most
                Members of the Assembly come from east of the Bann. We shall
                therefore have an uphill battle on all these fronts. The mindset
                of the Government and their officials has been to keep inward
                investment from places like Fermanagh. The facts are staring us
                in the face; you have only to look. This is not something that
                we are making up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Domestic consumers should have a choice of
                cheaper fuel if it is available. We have to pay the highest
                price for virtually everything in places like Fermanagh/South
                Tyrone, where there is a monopoly at work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are positive aspects too to increased
                employment. We hope that we can get new and small industries
                into our areas and support them. We hope that we can have
                cheaper fuel to help to attract them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a cross-border dimension as well.
                There is a whole region on the far side of Fermanagh —Donegal,
                Leitrim and other areas could be considered when the viability
                of a gas pipeline is under discussion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the margin there is the recent agriculture
                crisis and we will have the fallout from that over the next
                10&nbsp;years. The future needs of that industry will have to be
                considered, given that young people will not continue to work in
                it. There is a need for farm employment to help with future
                needs, and cheaper fuel could well be the kick-start that is
                needed for agriculture.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to look at the document which could
                shape our future. Its aims and objectives have been rural
                regeneration, economic development and a living and working
                countryside. That is what we want to move towards and we look at
                the facts and figures and at the aims and objectives of some of
                these reports, and we wonder how genuine they are. We need to
                see all of this happening in our areas. We need to know that we
                are going to be treated differently in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equality is a political matter, but we also
                need equality between east and west. Outside Dublin there is the
                same type of situation: the deprivation in rural areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everything is pushed towards the built-up
                areas because of the greater population and political clout. I
                should like to see change, and thus welcome the opportunity to
                support the aims of the motion, which will benefit rural areas.
                The issue needs to be re-examined by the Minister, in particular
                in relation to rural needs and equality.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the motion. The extension of gas
                pipelines beyond the Greater Belfast area depends to a large
                degree on an increase in the capacity of the trans-Irish Sea
                pipeline from Scotland to Belfast. In the absence of such
                doubling up, it is doubtful that either a north-west routing of
                an additional pipeline or a supplementary pipeline through the
                Lagan Valley will be achieved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maximum interconnection between
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland and the national and European gas networks
                is of great value.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, there is security of energy supply
                because being part of a larger network results in cost economies
                and lower prices.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, through the existing
                interconnection of gas systems and their possible extension,
                there is greater competition between energy types, thus putting
                pressure on electricity prices. I see no conflict between
                proposals for additional gas pipelines and the development of
                the electricity interconnector. Both will result in greater
                competition and liberalisation of energy markets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, there is competitive advantage to
                energy users, especially industry. Electricity prices here are
                one quarter higher than in Great&nbsp;Britain, though for most
                manufacturers energy costs amount to only 3% or 4% of company
                turnover, so the cost benefit which might be achieved through
                cheaper energy sources should be not exaggerated. However, there
                will be some benefit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fourthly, there is the environmental issue
                — natural gas is relatively clean energy. Carbon emissions,
                particularly of carbon dioxide, are lower than those from coal
                or oil. That is important because Northern&nbsp;Ireland, as part
                of the United&nbsp;Kingdom, must meet CO<sub>2</sub> reduction
                limits by 2010.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Doherty recommended a cost-benefit
                analysis of pipelines, taking wider social benefits into
                account. Such benefits would be above the bottom lines of
                companies such as PowerGen, which might be involved in these
                projects. I agree with him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, Members must first consider the cost
                benefit of doubling up the Scotland-Belfast gas link, and look
                at the proposed north-west routing of a pipeline — the main
                subject of the debate — and at the possibility of a pipeline
                through the Lagan Valley. After all, that region has a
                population of the same magnitude as the north-west corridor.
                Both of those potential pipelines will require an element of
                public subsidy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate has displayed how
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, despite being a small region normally
                regarded as being economically depressed, has in it significant
                disparities of income and employment.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The explanations are complex, but, basically,
                this situation exists because new economic activity tends to be
                concentrated in areas where there is already substantial
                economic activity. This is unfortunate for those areas which are
                left &quot;in the cold&quot;, but it is not, necessarily, a
                sinister development. Contrary to the arguments made by
                Sinn&nbsp;Fein Members this morning, academic studies of the
                subject provide little evidence to show that these disparities
                of income or employment were deliberately created by the
                Government, either in the pre-1972 Stormont era, or in the
                period of direct rule which followed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are, of course, various ways in which
                the Government could try to redress these disparities. However,
                I would caution Members against believing that large-scale, and
                potentially very expensive, public intervention in the energy
                industry would necessarily represent the most cost-effective way
                of achieving greater economic parity across all regions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is desirable that every home in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland have access to natural gas, but we should
                not regard this as a fundamental human right. Adam&nbsp;Smith,
                the eighteenth-century Scottish economist, wrote, somewhat
                tongue-in-cheek — to borrow an earlier phrase — that it
                would be desirable to grow wine in the Scottish Highlands.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He went on to say, however, that it would be
                too costly to build the necessary greenhouses on the slopes of
                Ben Nevis. In the same way we need to be careful, subject to the
                full cost-benefit analysis, that we do not commit ourselves to
                astronomically expensive projects when there are other, less
                costly, ways of providing economic support to disadvantaged
                areas of the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the pipeline, given that public
                finances will, almost certainly, be limited, the Assembly may
                find itself faced with the difficult choice of whether to extend
                the pipeline along the north-west corridor, or along the Lagan
                Valley. Until such times as this kind of decision has to be
                made, I am happy to support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Farren:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to participate in
                this debate. The obvious consensus that has emerged is very
                significant. In itself, this underlines the urgent need for
                agreement on the outstanding political issues so that we can
                concentrate on the kind of issues we are discussing today and
                make the kind of decisions which are commensurate with our
                responsibility to ensure the good management of public finances
                and the provision of the best possible infrastructure for the
                energy supply industry and for all other related industries. I
                note and support many of the points that were made by the last
                Member who spoke.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the matter of energy supply in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, many commentators have pointed out that
                the market is too small to allow for significant economies of
                scale.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a need, therefore, to look at wider
                contexts in which to make such economies of scale possible and
                to take advantage of the different energy sources available.
                Such contexts include Scotland, the South and, indeed, the
                European mainland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the current expectations associated
                with new North/South opportunities, many people anticipate
                enhanced co-operation in the area of energy supply. With such
                large investments required — a point which has been stressed
                in several Members’ contributions — there is a clear
                imperative to take advantage of the obvious mutual benefit that
                could be derived from meeting the needs of a market from both
                parts of the island by co-ordinating the planning of an energy
                strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A critical objective for
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland must be the achievement of the lowest
                possible electricity supply costs. The continuing high cost of
                electricity is a deterrent to investment and places
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland at a considerable disadvantage in
                comparison with the South. In the South, low energy costs,
                combined with other incentives, add to its advantages when
                investment decisions are being made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Central to the consideration of future energy
                strategy should be the question of gas supply in both parts of
                the island. Indeed, now that we are moving towards the adoption
                of a strategy that will lay the basis for energy supply far into
                the next century — and this is being clearly anticipated by
                the economic strategy review underway in the Department of
                Economic Development — we must ensure that the most effective
                gas network, in terms of both security and value for money, is
                developed for the whole island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is therefore critical that planning for a
                gas supply be undertaken in the context of the needs of Ireland
                as a whole, but with respect to the northern half of the island
                in particular. In my view, a line drawn from Dublin to Galway
                and northwards would be the immediate context for the
                development of an appropriate gas-network strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We know that in the South planning is well
                advanced for the next phase of the gas network. And with
                additional connections being planned into Scotland’s gas
                network, it is critical that a northern link be included to
                create an all-island network.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recent discoveries of viable gas fields in
                the Corrib exploration area off the west coast of Ireland
                underline even more pertinently the need for such a provision.
                Extending a network beyond Belfast to service the north-west, as
                well as customers along the Belfast to Newry axis, should form
                part of such a strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must begin comprehensive negotiations with
                the appropriate authorities in the South because, in the absence
                of negotiations, plans could be advanced for additional links to
                Scotland without any consideration being given to the
                development of a North-South link.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As part of an overall development, I, like
                many of my SDLP&nbsp;colleagues and other Assembly Members
                today, urge that an early decision be taken to build a new
                gas-generating plant at Coolkeeragh. A new gas-fired generating
                station there, which would be a significant customer for a
                north-west gas link, would not only ensure the continuation of
                generation there and the retention of the expertise involved,
                but also provide a new and important addition to the area’s
                industrial and commercial infrastructure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The availability of a natural gas supply
                along the north-west corridor would make the whole area
                north-west of Belfast more attractive — towns such as
                Ballymena, Ballymoney, Coleraine and Limavady where the
                commercial and industrial sectors are already expressing
                considerable interest in the availability of gas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In keeping with the general plans for
                regional development over the next two or three decades —
                plans revealed last week place emphasis on growth areas outside
                the eastern corridor — the needs of the north-west must
                receive special attention. If this focus is to be meaningful,
                the provision of energy supplies — particularly via a gas
                pipeline — deserves special consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members have referred to the economics
                of developing the gas supply, and we will face hard decisions
                when we address that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The emergence of public and private
                partnerships is a notable feature of recent economic planning,
                particularly with respect to infrastructural initiatives. We
                have already had some examples of that approach here; the
                Scottish interconnector could not have been planned without
                guarantees of public financing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of the overall need for
                infrastructural development, as well as of economics, there is
                an imperative that the motion recognizes. We should call for the
                papers; we should have an early opportunity to examine the
                evidence in detail, after which we will probably recommend that
                this development proceed so that secure, efficient and cheaper
                forms of energy can be provided in the north-west and
                south-east.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this debate. I remember the last
                time the natural gas issue was debated in an Assembly. I and my
                party were booed and heckled because we supported the extension
                of the Kinsale pipeline to Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us have some reality here. Unless we move
                forward with the formation of the Executive, the Departments and
                the North-South bodies, this morning’s exercise will have been
                a waste of hot air.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that in this Chamber there is a
                desire to move forward so that the Assembly can take the
                decisions that —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr R Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has nothing to do with the debate. If
                the Member has something constructive to say about the pipeline,
                let him say it. Let us not bring politics into this issue.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What I am saying has everything to do with
                the debate. If the Assembly wants to move forward and take
                decisions on Belfast Harbour or on the natural gas pipeline,
                then it has to have real powers. Such decisions cannot be taken
                unless the power to do so is transferred. We must move forward
                with urgency and develop the Assembly’s structures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the resolution. It will bring major
                benefits to the north-west, however, I greatly resent the
                Government’s decision to go ahead with the interconnector to
                Scotland while this issue remained unresolved. On Tuesday
                17&nbsp;November I requested a meeting with Mr&nbsp;Ingram on
                this subject and on 18&nbsp;November he made his decision on the
                interconnector. I find that decision despicable.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A meeting is to be held with the Minister on
                6 January. I have written to the other parties, and I hope that,
                on that occasion, all the parties in the Assembly can unite to
                try to persuade the Minister to look with some urgency at the
                development of the north-west pipeline.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a bread-and-butter issue, similar to
                the integrated schools issue. We went to that meeting together
                — almost united — and the Government responded very
                positively. Regrettably Ulidia School, which is in my
                constituency, did not benefit, but we live to fight another day.
                If we are to move forward, let us get real about powers for this

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank everyone who participated in this
                debate, and I am grateful for such widespread support, albeit
                one or two Members widened the debate considerably to deal with
                lignite and Belfast Port, both important in their own right, but
                a little outside the scope of today’s debate.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is my maiden speech, and there is a
                tradition that one does not give way in a maiden speech.
                However, I will be unmaidenly tomorrow and will accept any
                advances that are made to me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If anyone is still lukewarm about this issue,
                may I point out that it is of importance not just to some areas.
                It is vital to everyone in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, for a country
                divided against itself cannot prosper.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My initial contribution to the debate, of
                necessity, painted a fairly bleak picture of the present
                situation, and a bleak picture of the consequences of further
                Government inaction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the best way to respond to the many
                vital points raised today is to concentrate on the positive
                benefits that would come from the extension of gas provision,
                and to call for positive Government action in terms of carrying
                out a comprehensive socio-economic analysis, as well as positive
                action to ensure that funding is available for a project that
                will bring great benefit in many fields — the economy, the
                environment, energy policy and social need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is an excellent European Union structural
                fund project that will facilitate diversification of the local
                economies and improve industrial competitiveness. It would be a
                flagship project for this region, and would be in line with many
                Government and EC objectives. There is already a real and
                committed private sector interest in this project. Environmental
                benefits are many. The north and west would be able to
                contribute their share to the reduction of global warming and
                the promotion of a clean environment by a significant reduction
                of emissions of carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, black smoke and
                nitrogen oxide.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The net present value of the reduction in
                environmental damage costs would be about £20&nbsp;million over
                25 years. In terms of energy policy, the extension of the gas
                pipeline would fit well with the Government’s stated
                objectives in this area, and would reduce costs to consumers by
                almost £10&nbsp;million per annum over 10 years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, there are no more compelling
                arguments in favour of the extension of natural gas than those
                relating to social need. I congratulate the Assembly for its
                appreciation of this matter and for its support. I beg leave to

                Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s Hospital Service is, I believe, one of
                the early political challenges facing the new Assembly, and I
                hope to explain why.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know from my own experience in Scotland
                just how difficult it is to address the complex issues
                associated with the Hospital Service. It is not easy to achieve
                change. Yet change is vital if this great service is to weather
                the pressures that it now faces and to emerge as a first-class
                service that all of our people need and rightly demand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The challenge facing the Assembly is to see
                beyond the pressures on individual hospitals and local services,
                and to grasp the strategic picture. It is for the Assembly to
                develop a coherent and stable Hospital Service for the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland of the twenty-first century. To do so,
                Members must pioneer new and collaborative approaches to
                hospital provision — in essence, putting patients before
                facilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I well understand the fears of local
                communities when services are to be apparently &quot;cut&quot;
                or &quot;downgraded&quot;. But I also well understand the need
                to develop the hospital service strategically if it is to
                deliver the standard of service that people will have the right
                to expect in the twenty-first century.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was specifically to help the Assembly with
                this task that I produced ‘Putting it Right’. It is an
                important document setting out the most radical approach to
                Northern Ireland’s hospital provision in 40&nbsp;years —
                yes, 40&nbsp;years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Too often our debate about hospitals centres
                on bricks and mortar rather than on delivering the best possible
                care for patients, and patients have a right to receive the
                right care in the right place at the right time and from the
                right person — that is what matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a sad fact that the quality of some of
                our services is simply not as good in Northern&nbsp;Ireland as
                it is in other parts of the United&nbsp;Kingdom, and we must
                address this urgently. We have to do better and ensure that our
                services are second to none. This means change — we cannot
                cling to the past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me say clearly and unambiguously that
                this strategy is not about cutting expenditure; nor is it about
                closing hospitals. None will close, but all will change — and
                change for the better.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government have already signalled the
                importance that we attach to building a modern and effective
                Health Service. Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s Health Service has
                already received an additional £60&nbsp;million since the
                Government came into office and will continue to get its fair
                share of future investment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Earlier today I gave details of the massive
                boost for health and social services in Northern Ireland arising
                from the comprehensive spending review (CSR). As part of our
                commitment to modernising the service, we have already spent
                substantial additional funds this year — about
                £53&nbsp;million. Over the next three years, an additional
                £732&nbsp;million will be available to spend on health and
                social care.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Detailed decisions on how the extra funds are
                to be spent will ultimately be for the Assembly, but for the
                1999-2000 financial year it is planned that the following
                programmes will benefit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Community care will receive an additional
                £25&nbsp;million; mental health and learning disability
                services will receive an additional £5 million on top of the
                £25&nbsp;million for community care; childcare services will
                receive an additional £7·5&nbsp;million to take forward the
                implementation of the Children Order and to make improvements in
                children’s homes; cancer services will receive an extra
                £7&nbsp;million and renal services an additional
                £1·5&nbsp;million to support the continued expansion of the
                service; the building and maintenance programme will also
                receive an extra £6 million for the capital programme and last,
                but by no means least, acute services will be provided with an
                additional £7·5&nbsp;million to reduce further the number of
                in-patients waiting for treatment and to contribute to the
                meeting of other pressures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What needs to change in the Hospital Service?
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s Hospital Service is facing a crisis.
                What we have lacked is a clear vision of the way forward and a
                plan to address urgently a number of critical problems facing
                the service. Without prompt action there is a growing risk of
                service breakdown.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All patients should receive the same
                high-quality care regardless of where they live. That does not
                always happen at present, and some patients are being admitted
                to hospitals that are not adequately equipped to provide the
                support they need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have looked at the current services and
                have found a number of causes for concern. For example, because
                they work in small hospitals, some doctors are on call for 104
                hours week after week. How can these doctors be expected to
                provide a quality service on that basis?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some surgeons, without the best training, are
                performing major operations. How can this guarantee quality
                service? Services at busy major hospitals are being held back by
                lack of resources, while smaller units are tying up expert staff
                to undertake a handful of procedures each day. Does this make
                sense?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Small hospitals, struggling to meet rising
                standards, are heavily reliant on a diminishing pool of general
                surgeons. How can this benefit patients?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Small maternity units do not deliver enough
                babies to justify employing expert children’s doctors to deal
                with emergencies. How does this secure the safety of mother and
                baby?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More than half of Northern Ireland’s
                accident and emergency departments lack the expert staff and
                support necessary to treat serious injuries or illnesses. This
                can cost lives. The fact that the service has coped until now is
                a mark of the skill and dedication of staff at every level. But
                we cannot base future service provision on the continued
                selflessness of staff.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What needs to be done? I said earlier that
                patients have the right to receive the right treatment in the
                right place at the right time, delivered by the right person. To
                achieve this, hospitals have to be organised to make full use of
                the considerable skills and talents of professional health
                staff. Our goal must be to ensure that all patients, no matter
                where they live, receive an equally high level of quality health
                care.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In searching for the best answer, I looked at
                a number of possible ways forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, keeping hospital services as they are.
                This approach would not guarantee a sustainable Hospital Service
                of modern standards. Hospitals which serve small populations do
                not treat enough patients or illnesses to allow their medical
                staff to acquire or maintain skills. Difficulties in training
                and recruiting staff mean that the current service cannot be
                maintained.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, expanding the services available at
                all existing hospitals. The problems facing the Hospital Service
                are not primarily about money. They are more about how hospitals
                are structured to pool expertise. Spreading scarce resources
                more thinly would result in equipment being underused in many
                hospitals and highly trained and motivated staff struggling to
                maintain their skills. In other words, spending more to buy
                less.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, concentrating services. The British
                Medical Association and the medical Royal Colleges suggest that
                a population the size of Northern&nbsp;Ireland should have only
                three major hospitals. This could improve the quality of care
                for people with major illnesses but would raise serious issues
                about access to services for people living in rural areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">None of the approaches I have outlined
                guarantees a first-class, accessible Hospital Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we need is a new approach, with all of
                our hospitals working together in clinical networks to improve
                patient care. This will allow the hospitals to be mutually
                supportive and make the best use of staff and other resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Future services will be provided in local
                hospitals and will be strongly linked to area hospitals and
                directly supported by them. Major illnesses will be treated at
                area or regional hospitals where patients can be guaranteed
                expert care and treatment for the most serious conditions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This will allow the relocation of some
                existing services, with the presumption that care will be
                provided close to patients’ homes where this is in their
                interest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local hospitals will be Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s
                hospitals of first resort. They will be strongly linked to area
                hospitals and develop an increasing number of services with
                them. More and more frequently, patients will go there for
                investigations, for outpatient clinics and for day treatments,
                including day surgery.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These hospitals will provide an important
                base for consultants, many of whom will divide their time
                between area and local services. They will have specialist
                diagnostic equipment and the staff necessary to provide a full
                range of outpatient clinics and day surgery. These operations
                will be provided locally unless there are good clinical reasons
                to do otherwise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To deal with problems of access in the more
                remote parts of Northern Ireland, three local hospitals will
                provide a more general acute service to their local population.
                They will be an integral part of the area network and will be
                located at Coleraine, Daisy Hill in Newry and in the southern
                part of the Western Board area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Patients with the most serious illnesses will
                be sent to their area hospital. This will provide a wide range
                of specialties. Area hospitals will be equipped to deliver
                high-quality specialist in-patient care and to offer a
                round-the-clock emergency operating service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional Hospital Service will provide
                patients with access to highly skilled care and treatment,
                supported by the latest technology such as coronary bypass
                surgery and kidney transplantation. They will continue to
                provide patients in Northern&nbsp;Ireland with skilled care and
                treatment supported by the latest technology. They will be
                centres of excellence in their own specialties, and they will
                share knowledge and experience with other hospitals in Northern
                Ireland’s clinical network.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the concern about the future of
                accident and emergency services. There are 16&nbsp;departments
                in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, the majority of which do not meet
                current standards. We need to develop a strong local service to
                deal with the majority of minor or straightforward treatments,
                and some state-of-the-art units to cover the major injuries and
                life-threatening traumas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most patients will be treated in new local
                accident units in each local hospital. These will be led by
                nurse practitioners, supported by specialist staff and by
                services that are based at the nearest area hospital. The
                specialist accident and emergency departments will be in area
                hospitals which will be staffed and supported to provide the
                very best of accident and emergency care and treatment. They
                will directly admit serious accident cases and people with major
                illnesses, and will be able to initiate immediate treatment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recognition of the problems of people
                living in rural isolation, the three local hospitals that
                provide a more general acute service will also provide a range
                of accident and emergency services which will be networked with
                the closest area accident and emergency department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To make this approach work, we must have a
                first-rate ambulance service, supported by a highly trained
                ambulance staff. Ambulances must be able to pick up emergency
                cases quickly, provide instant treatment to stabilise seriously
                ill patients, have computer links to expert support, and be able
                to bring a patient from anywhere in Northern&nbsp;Ireland to the
                right hospital, quickly and safely. This service must be an
                integral part of any new arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To make the vision a reality, we need early
                action to build up the service and enhance the training of
                ambulance staff. A commitment is also needed to develop a future
                specialist transport service to transfer seriously ill or
                injured patients safely between hospitals. That will mean new
                investment in these vital services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our hospital service is too important to be
                allowed to drift towards crisis. That is why I am opening up the
                debate on the way forward, and I am offering to make myself
                available to discuss these matters. There is an urgent need for
                a new strategic approach to hospital services. Inevitably, the
                future of hospital services will be one of the first major
                issues falling to the Assembly. The paper has been prepared to
                assist the Assembly with that difficult task, and to ensure that
                the strategic issues underlying any decision are understood and
                appreciated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While it will be for the Assembly to decide
                what must be done, the proposals offer a practical and realistic
                way forward. They will ensure that patients get the same
                high-quality care no matter where they live, and that they will
                be treated by doctors who are not working impossibly long hours,
                thereby guaranteeing better quality care.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Patients needing major operations can be
                confident that they will be undertaken by fully trained
                specialist surgeons working in expert teams with full clinical
                and technical support, and they can be assured that hospital
                resources are fully focused on delivering the best patient care
                rather than propping up declining services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mothers-to-be can be confident that the
                maternity unit they attend has expert staff and that they will
                be able to choose the type of delivery that they want in a safe
                environment. Seriously ill patients who attend accident and
                emergency departments will get the highest possible quality of
                expert care and treatment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local accident units will quickly and
                effectively treat patients with less serious conditions.
                Patients needing emergency treatment will receive high-quality
                care from a rapid response ambulance service, with expert
                ambulance staff in direct communication with specialist teams in
                an accident and emergency hospital department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the Assembly must take the major
                decisions on the future of hospital services, there is an urgent
                need to develop the ambulance service. A modern and highly
                proficient ambulance service is the key to unlocking the way
                forward. With that in mind, I recently commissioned a major
                review of the service which will point the way forward and make
                the best use of existing resources. More needs to be done. To
                help build the service that we need, I am prepared to commit
                £15&nbsp;million over the next three years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The overall challenge for the Assembly will
                be to agree a strategy that will address current pressures and
                enable our hospitals to deliver the first-class service which
                patients have the right to expect well into the next century.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the meantime I will take whatever
                decisions are necessary to preserve the safety and effectiveness
                of our hospitals. I would like to think the Assembly will be
                able to relieve me of the task of setting its future direction.
                I am convinced that change is needed, and needed soon, if we are
                to deliver a modern and effective first-class hospital service
                which can meet the present and future needs of the people of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Forty&nbsp;years ago, at the time of the last
                major hospital review in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, the idea of man
                setting foot on the moon was sheer fantasy, but since then the
                world has unimaginably moved on. However, our hospitals have
                barely changed during that time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time to plan for the next 40&nbsp;years
                so that those who serve the Health Service can work together as
                part of an extended team, and can be proud of their
                professionalism. They must be practising in an organisation that
                can exploit their skills, thereby serving the interests of
                patients throughout Northern&nbsp;Ireland. We need a service
                which does not cling to the past but looks to the future with
                confidence and &quot;puts it right&quot; for the twenty-first
                century.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to welcome the Minister to the
                Assembly. He has kept his promise to meet us. We also welcome
                the announcement about extra finance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a challenging time for health and
                personal social services in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, and we are
                aware of the big issues confronting us. Like the Minister, I am
                impressed by the skills, commitment and professionalism of the
                many capable people in the Health Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The paper ‘Putting it Right’ projects the
                future direction for hospital services in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.
                It points the way and we make the decisions. The Minister used a
                double-edged sword when he said &quot;I have not interfered with
                your democratic right, neither will I allow myself to be your
                scapegoat.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the paper should be called ‘Getting
                it Right’, but how do we go about that? The Minister’s
                presentation was concise, and I commend him on his honesty and
                frankness. He spoke about what needs to be done and said that
                hospital services were facing a critical time. He said there was
                a grave risk that services would break down, and mentioned the
                need to ensure reasonable access to acute services for people in
                the more remote parts of Northern&nbsp;Ireland. He said that a
                small number of local hospitals would provide a more general
                acute service for local populations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People in rural areas fear for the future of
                their local hospitals. They feel under threat, and will fight
                tooth and nail to ensure that there is a hospital in their area.
                The threat to local hospitals makes people frightened and angry,
                and they also feel exposed and at risk.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recent months I spoke to some health-care
                professionals, and I am aware of their concerns and of the
                requirements of the Royal Colleges. They are at the coalface,
                and the community needs the good quality service that they
                provide.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have said, people in rural areas are
                fearful. My constituency in Fermanagh equates to other rural
                areas, including south Tyrone and Dungannon. South-west
                Fermanagh is neglected in many aspects of public provision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the golden six scenario, Fermanagh and
                also west of the Bann are not catered for. Altnagelvin Hospital
                is in the Western Board area, but it is accessible to people in
                the south-western part of the board’s area only at the cost of
                travelling many miles. The Sperrin and Lakeland Trust covers a
                largely rural area in the local government area of Fermanagh,
                Omagh and the southern part of Strabane. The estimated
                population in 1995 was 114,000. The low population density
                creates some special problems in relation to the provision of
                accessible services. Another difficulty is that Lough&nbsp;Erne
                divides the County of Fermanagh.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer to the 1994 &quot;Social
                Deprivation&quot; document of the Western Health and Social
                Services Board. The board looked at the work showing the strong
                relationship between health and deprivation, which replicated
                the work of Townsend. Four&nbsp;key measures of material
                deprivation were identified: unemployment, car ownership, home
                ownership and overcrowding. On that index, the three district
                council areas of Fermanagh, Omagh and Strabane are ranked 15th,
                19th and 26th out of the 26&nbsp;district council areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Accessibility to services is a major factor
                that determines how needs can best be met. If people do not find
                the service accessible, it is a poor quality service. The road
                network from Enniskillen to Altnagelvin has slow journey times,
                and that unique situation needs to be taken into account.
                Concerns about the poor roads infrastructure and the importance
                of periods such as the golden hour are vital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Four options for the future hospital
                provision in Omagh and Enniskillen were referred to in the
                review. These were: closure of both hospitals; no change;
                closure of both hospitals and a new building; one service on two
                sites. The last is the recommendation currently before the
                Western Health Board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister referred to the Accident and
                Emergency Service. Here is one of the most emotive topics when
                considering the pattern of acute services. This is a core
                service, and intense pressures would be created if one of the
                departments were to be wiped out. There is a sizeable demand
                from tourists at the Erne Hospital, amounting to over 25% of the
                summer workload.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The advantages of having two sites and one
                service are that they will maintain local access; they will
                improve the potential for some specialisation between and within
                the two hospitals; they will improve the management of clinical
                volume and workload across the two hospitals, and there will be
                the potential for economies of scale; and, as the Minister has
                said, they will be mutually supportive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1996-97 the Erne Hospital admitted almost
                11,000&nbsp;patients, with an average of 168&nbsp;beds occupied
                per day; accident and emergency attendances totalled nearly
                17,000, and over 34,000&nbsp;outpatient attendances were also
                recorded. A hospital of this type is vital to the needs of the
                dispersed local community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vital economic issues also need to be
                considered. In 1996-97 Health and Social Services generated
                approximately £57&nbsp;million in revenue for the Fermanagh
                economy; the Sperrin and Lakeland Trust employs
                1,764&nbsp;people in county Fermanagh; wages and salaries total
                £26·5&nbsp;million, representing 73% of all the income for
                that sector; and employees of the health and social services
                contribute £36&nbsp;million to Fermanagh’s purchasing power.
                Such a contribution is important for any rural area, and if it
                were to be taken away and not replaced, there would be great
                deprivation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In summary, the Minister’s document is very
                general. On what basis are assumptions made to back up the
                proposed model? The joint council-Sperrin Lakeland Trust
                approach — a single hospital on two sites — appears to have
                been discounted — without any serious consideration having
                been given to it. The Western Health and Social Services Board’s
                review has been rendered useless.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposals are another example of applying
                an urban solution to a rural problem. No account has been taken
                of the physical infrastructure, as is evident from ‘Putting It
                Right’. The ‘Shaping Our Future’ strategy also lacks any
                reference to health issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Enniskillen and Omagh are two of only seven
                urban hubs identified in the ‘Shaping Our Future’ strategy.
                Emphasis should be placed on this proposal to ensure that
                provision is made to take account of this growth of 3,200
                households.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The impact on the local economy must be
                considered fully in any analysis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tourism adds to the population that has to be
                served in that part of the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cross-border issue must also be
                considered, though this can and will work both ways.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The continuous erosion of services in rural
                areas may be exacerbated by this model, in which the local
                hospital becomes a &quot;super health centre&quot;, causing
                rural GPs to relocate to larger towns in order to provide their
                service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An upgraded and vital Ambulance Service needs
                an appropriate and good road network. Indeed, the Northern
                Ireland Forum for Political Dialogue presented a very good
                report on the Ambulance Service. We said that it has been the
                Cinderella service, but we hoped that that would change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need new and innovative thinking on the
                delivery of services by administrators and especially the
                medical profession.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Overall, the document appears to have been
                rushed. There is nothing about consultation or grounded
                evidence, and it makes many assumptions. Indeed, many
                specialisations &quot;above and around the head&quot; are not
                even considered — for example, ear, nose and throat treatment.
                I am convinced that we need to give services to the patients;
                not take them away. There is an ethical and moral issue to
                consider.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.30 pm</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister, and I would like to
                thank him for the briefing he gave to the party spokespersons on
                health, prior to the launch of ‘Putting It Right’ on 30
                November. The document sets out the difficulties facing the
                Hospital Service — particularly in the smaller hospitals —
                spells out the realities and emphasises the urgency of the
                situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This document is neither a Green Paper for
                discussion, nor a White Paper for legislation; the Minister is
                — quite rightly — leaving all the important decisions for
                his successor in the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the analysis, however, the Minister spells
                out the stark realities. In some areas patients are being
                admitted to hospitals that are not adequately equipped to
                provide the full range of tests and support they need. I agree
                with the Minister that continuing inaction could cost lives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation is very serious, and
                professionals working at the delivery end of the Health Service
                have warned that an imminent crisis is facing some of the
                smaller hospitals. Every Member knows in his or her heart that
                urgent decisions have to be made. That is why I make no apology
                for stating a powerful political point. Only when the shadow
                Executive is formed and power is transferred to the Assembly and
                Executive will Members be able to face up to their
                responsibilities in respect of health issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many good and valid reasons for
                setting up the shadow Executive now. Indeed, it could have been
                set up last July. But, even at this late stage, Members must not
                shirk their duties. Health must be at the top of the Assembly’s
                agenda, and I call on the First Minister (Designate) and Deputy
                First Minister (Designate) to set up the shadow Executive
                forthwith.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With great advances in medical technology,
                the 17 acute hospitals in Northern&nbsp;Ireland cannot be
                expected to have a full range of specialist surgical, medical,
                paediatric and other services. The Royal Colleges are concerned
                about staff being adequately trained, and the Royal College of
                Surgeons has laid down specific criteria for an efficient,
                high-quality, surgical service. These include an accident and
                emergency department led by an accident and emergency
                specialist, round-the-clock availability of high technology
                equipment with CT scanners, emergency operating theatres and
                intensive care facilities. Only the Royal Victoria Hospital, the
                Ulster&nbsp;Hospital and Altnagelvin Hospital comply with those
                requirements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An accident and emergency department which
                does not have a consultant in accident and emergency medicine
                and which is without access to the full range of support
                services is not equipped to treat the most seriously ill
                patients.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential that trainee doctors learn
                about the conditions and illnesses they will be dealing with.
                Hands-on experience is both necessary and mandatory, but,
                unfortunately, some smaller hospitals are not always able to
                provide the work experience necessary for trainees to develop
                that expertise and secure training recognition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Quality of treatment and equality of success
                in respect of that treatment are essential for all the people. A
                proper balance must be struck between providing local services
                and treating complex and life-threatening conditions in major
                hospitals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are told that the focus of health care
                will remain in the community and that GPs and primary-care teams
                will be expected to develop and expand the range of services
                they provide. There is to be more scope for GPs to look after
                their own patients in local hospitals, providing patients with
                continuity of care. Nine out of ten patients are already treated
                in the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister emphasises the development of
                nurse practitioners who can take lead roles in such areas as
                minor injuries and neonatal care. His vision sets out a new
                approach in which hospitals and primary-care teams work
                together. Most people have their needs met in the community or
                in the local hospital with relatively few requiring area or
                regional services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A modernised Ambulance Service with skilled
                staff, who are to be known as first responders, will use
                motorbikes — that is certainly an interesting idea — cars,
                or whatever is necessary to achieve an effective response. The
                local hospital is to be the cornerstone of the future Hospital
                Service — although I accept that every hospital cannot offer a
                full accident and emergency service, and the idea of a local
                accident unit does make sense.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s Paper is hard to fault so
                far as principles are concerned, and, in most respects, it
                follows successful regional strategies, although it does contain
                some new points.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Major changes are proposed, but at what point
                should they be tested by way of public consultation? Will they
                be subject to policy appraisal and fair treatment analysis?
                Departments are required to take fair treatment aspects fully
                into account when developing new policies or reviewing existing
                ones. Was this done? If so, what was the outcome?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New features include great emphasis on
                additional services to be provided by GPs, some vague
                aspirations about networking, a significant dependence on nurse
                practitioners, the promotion of the three hospitals — Daisy
                Hill, Coleraine and either Tyrone County or Erne — and the
                demotion of Lagan&nbsp;Valley and the Mater to local-hospital
                status.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Has the Minister considered the workload that
                would arise from extending the services of the primary care
                team? GPs, nurses and social workers already have heavy loads.
                Should pseudo-hospital functions be added to already busy lives?
                The notion of networking is scarcely freshly minted, but what
                will it mean in reality? What new structures would allow
                practical additions to existing relationships between
                professionals? How many nurse practitioners are in the service,
                and how many will be needed to do what is proposed? Are training
                arrangements in hand, and how many people are in training?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most people will welcome the formal
                recognition of the three hospitals in addition to the golden
                six. Community services will escalate. It is not a solution to
                problems in the hospital service to dump them on other
                hardworking people who are under-resourced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The major impediment to the Minister’s
                vision is undoubtedly the potential capital cost. For example,
                in winter, medical emergencies in Belfast can be a nightmare.
                Beds are like gold dust, and patients queue in accident and
                emergency departments if not in the corridors of the Royal and
                the City Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is simply no prospect of the two big
                hospitals functioning in winter if they have to add the
                in-patients of Lagan Valley and the Mater to their existing load
                — unless of course there is significant additional capital
                expenditure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposal to demote the Mater Hospital
                does not make sense when it seems that the Government have
                already decided to invest £7&nbsp;million in a new ward unit.
                Has this decision been rescinded?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SDLP colleagues and I have had discussions
                with Dominic Pinto from the Omagh Hospital, Keith&nbsp;Marshall
                of the Erne, Basil&nbsp;McNamee from Dungannon and
                Patrick&nbsp;Piper of the Mid-Ulster Hospital. From our
                discussions it is clear that a major area hospital is essential
                in the south-west, the territory which stretches from
                Magherafelt to the distant ends of Fermanagh. The precise
                location of that hospital will be discussed in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The great killers in Ireland, North and
                South, are cancer and heart disease. Cancer services for
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland are to be concentrated in the City
                Hospital. Senior cancer surgeon Mr&nbsp;Roy&nbsp;Spence and
                Professor of Oncology Patrick&nbsp;Johnston have joined forces
                with colleagues in Dublin on the research and development of
                cancer services for the island as a whole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Major, expensive technologies have been
                developed. PET, or positron emission tomography, is a new
                procedure which allows a physician to examine images of the
                heart, veins and other organs. Unlike x-rays and CT and MRI
                scans, which show body structure or anatomy, PET images show the
                chemical functioning of an organ or tissue. PET technology can
                have a huge impact on the diagnosis of cancer, brain tumours,
                heart disease and other disorders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I strongly support the acquisition of this
                important technology for use on both sides of the border. It
                would be too expensive for any one area to purchase, but its use
                would save many lives. The United States and some European
                countries have been using PET for some years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is for the Assembly to ensure that
                everyone in Northern Ireland has equal access to a first-class
                health service. Important decisions must be made sooner rather
                than later.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister on his
                presentation and on being the first Minister in 40 years to
                examine regional hospital provision. Forty years ago in an
                attempt to cure health problems, a series of hospitals were
                created, but many have closed. I am rather wary about the
                Government putting matters right, because it seems that the
                hastily prepared solution omits rather large rafts of provision
                that are necessary to make an acute service work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rather than a long-winded speech, I pose some
                questions for the Minister. First, does the Minister think that
                the golden six hospitals are in the right positions?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is there not a case for a seventh golden
                hospital? The Minister has heard of the endeavours mentioned by
                my colleague Mr&nbsp;Foster from Enniskillen, and of the
                consultations about Omagh. Hospital provision in Fermanagh and
                Tyrone should be looked at. Tyrone is the larger rural county,
                with its centre of population in Omagh. Castlederg and Strabane
                hospitals have been closed, and to ensure equality of provision
                and availability in Dungannon, Cookstown, Kesh, Enniskillen, the
                Clogher Valley and Lisnaskea, there should be a golden hospital
                in the south-west of the Province. There is a reasonable case
                for the creation of a seventh or for the relocation of the sixth
                golden hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In considering ‘Putting It Right’, we
                should bear in mind that the vast majority of the population
                does not require acute hospital treatment. Most people go to GPs
                and treatment rooms. To make acute provision work effectively,
                account should be taken of the raft of care that should be
                provided by primary care centres of excellence. Care provision
                in the south-west should be supported by such centres of
                excellence and, therefore, the Erne, Omagh and Dungannon
                hospitals should be retained and improved to guarantee
                employment and excellence of service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some areas of existing provision have given
                cause for concern in recent years. I think in particular of the
                hype surrounding community care. We were told how good it would
                be. Expectations were raised but the provisions were not
                adequate. Could there be a lessening of the hype and greater
                clinical objectivity? At times the Assembly is so elevated that
                even an archangel could not deliver its expectations. We need to
                be realistic in our deliberations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people have had to travel from the west
                of the Province to London and to private hospitals in Scotland,
                as provision there is cheaper and more accessible. Patients and
                their partners fly out for surgery and a quality of treatment
                that is not available here, yet we are told that Northern
                Ireland provides the best service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A simple hip replacement costs £8,000 in the
                Royal, £6,000 in Altnagelvin and less than £3,000 in Eglinton
                private clinic, while elsewhere it costs under £2,000. There is
                something wrong with the system, and Members welcome the fact
                that this document defies the boundaries of the boards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I wish to make a special appeal for
                a 49-year-old who cannot speak and is severely mentally and
                physically handicapped. For 34&nbsp;years this person has been
                in Muckamore Abbey and is now being threatened with removal from
                24-hour excellent care to community care.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Christmas appeal to the Minister is to ask
                him to consider the case of Pauline, who is 49&nbsp;years old,
                and her family, who are not able to care properly for her
                because they themselves are elderly. He has it in his power to
                give them a Christmas present which they would very much
                appreciate.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh, I would like to welcome the
                Minister and the discussion document ‘Putting It Right’. It
                is important that we have a document which sets out a vision for
                the future of health care. This is the first opportunity that we
                have had to debate this issue. In the past, we have been told
                about services which are to be taken away, but not given any
                details of what services are to remain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to pay tribute to the staff in
                all the hospitals in the North. These people — doctors,
                nurses, ancillary staff, cleaning staff — have provided an
                important service to all of us in very difficult circumstances.
                They are a credit to their professions and a credit to the
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all have to recognise the need for change,
                although, obviously, no one wants these changes to take place in
                his or her area. We must move forward. Nonetheless, there are
                few areas of public policy which are more emotive than the
                provision of a health service. The document states that the
                changes are not simply cost-cutting or closures, and I hope that
                the Minister will be able to reassure us today that the purpose
                of these changes is to ensure the best possible service for all
                of the people, wherever they live and whatever service they
                require.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The area which I represent, Mid Ulster, has
                suffered a double blow. West of the Bann, over the years, we
                have been deprived of jobs, investment in infrastructure, and,
                now, we are to lose two acute hospitals — the Mid-Ulster and
                South Tyrone hospitals. The perception is that these two
                hospitals have been reduced to the status of local hospitals,
                and we need to reassure those communities that these hospitals
                will continue to provide a proper service. The South Tyrone
                hospital is situated in the best position to provide a service
                to Mid Ulster as well as south Tyrone and would be well situated
                to provide a maternity service for the area, whether in the form
                of a designated maternity unit or midwifery services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that the document sets out
                the services which will be available at the hospitals and does
                not simply state which services will be removed. However, I do
                not feel that the document promises sufficient resources to
                sustain these hospitals in the future. We need to be sure about
                the extent of provision for outpatients, day surgery and other
                services to the community. We should bring together everyone
                involved in the provision of health care in each area to ensure
                that the proper resources are available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I see much common sense in the document and
                agree that some changes are necessary. I urge all Members to
                discuss these proposals together, to ensure that we have a
                proper health service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We could all demand that our locality be left
                with all the facilities of an area hospital, but that would be
                unrealistic. The Assembly will soon have to make some hard
                choices. We will not be able to blame Ministers in future. It is
                therefore essential that we create the Executive that will bring
                about the structures for taking decisions here and implementing
                them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only the best is good enough for the people
                we represent, and we must aim to provide the best health-care
                service. I was alarmed to read that services in some hospitals
                are in danger of breaking down completely. That would be a
                disaster and demonstrates the urgent need for the Assembly to
                take decisions on health-care provision. We must provide a
                modern Health Service which is equipped with the most modern
                facilities, information and technical back-up in order to
                deliver care as close as possible to a patient’s home.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People will decide with their feet. They will
                go to where the best services are provided, as they have done in
                the past. And I am convinced that they will do so in the future
                when they require specialist treatment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One area requiring examination is that of
                preventative medicine. Many operations are carried out on a
                day-surgery basis, and I am thankful that that has removed much
                of the disruption and trauma for the patients and their
                families.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health care is also about the environment,
                housing and jobs. Good health does not come from hospitals or
                doctors’ surgeries. As the Ottawa Charter on health promotion
                states,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Health is created where people live,
                love, work, learn and play.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The road to reconstruction requires an attack
                on want, disease, ignorance, squalor, idleness and prejudice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past I have been critical of the way
                in which decisions have been made without consultation with the
                community. People have been very supportive of all their local
                hospitals, which they want to ensure are not run down or closed.
                There is considerable fear among people that they will be
                deprived of a local Health Service. They want a reassurance for
                the future. It is important that we involve all the community
                groups in the decision-making process, those who have
                fund-raised and supported action campaigns, because they can
                play a crucial role in managing future changes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is right for patients is what matters,
                and that will require change and sensible compromises between
                local provision and high quality standards of clinical care.
                Treatment should not cause unnecessary stress to patients or
                their families.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, can the Minister report on what
                provision is being made across the North to ensure the highest
                standard of clinical performance? Can he reassure patients that
                some of the recent scandals across the water — in particular,
                the one in Bristol — will not be repeated here, and that the
                people will receive the best possible standards of health care?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the Minister here today to
                present his vision for the future of the Health Service. I have
                read with interest the document ‘Putting it Right: The Case
                for Change in Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s Hospital Service’. No
                one can deny the rationale behind the need for regional
                hospitals, which will provide specialist services for everyone
                in Northern Ireland in areas such as neurosurgery, paediatric
                neurology, heart surgery and cancer. However, I have a
                difficulty with the split between the area hospitals and the
                local hospitals and with the proposals for their respective
                services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I come from the borough of Lisburn, and I
                represent the constituency of Lagan&nbsp;Valley, so the Minister
                will not be surprised to hear me argue strongly for the
                continuation of the excellent services that that hospital has
                provided over the years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The borough of Lisburn is the second-largest
                in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, with a population of some
                110,000&nbsp;people, and it is one of the fastest growing areas
                in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. The reason for its rapid growth is
                simply the excellent range of services provided for the people
                who live there. One of those excellent services is the
                Lagan&nbsp;Valley Hospital. The people of Lisburn would take it
                extremely ill if there were significant proposals to degrade or
                remove any of the services which are currently provided by that
                hospital. I am concerned that in the ‘Putting it Right’
                document, the threat of the axe seems to hang over, in
                particular, obstetrics and maternity services. How could Lagan
                Valley be</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the cornerstone of the new hospital
                service&quot; —</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the Minister’s own words — if the
                maternity department were removed? How would Lagan Valley be
                treating more people if over 1,000 expectant mothers were forced
                to use another hospital? How could that possibly be construed as
                a change for the better?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not think that anyone would consider
                maternity to be a serious illness. It is a natural progression
                in the reproduction of life. I accept that difficult births make
                up only one in 1,000 or fewer of the total. We would be throwing
                the baby out with the bathwater, so to speak, if we closed down
                maternity services because of so-called higher standards that
                have been established by some consultant. Surely
                Lagan&nbsp;Valley Hospital, with its superb buildings and its
                proximity to Belfast hospitals, can be supported on an outreach
                basis to maintain all of its services, including maternity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the Government’s emphasis on the
                environment, and the large and growing population of Lisburn,
                would it not be more appropriate to maintain a comprehensive
                range of local services, rather than have this large number of
                people — over 1,000 per annum — travelling in and out of
                central Belfast? On obstetrics, one option which I suggest for
                consideration is a consultant-supported, midwifery-led service.
                A similar trend is apparent in Lagan Valley Hospital. Midwives
                would take professional responsibility, but consultants would be
                based at Lagan Valley to provide the necessary advice and
                service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the past 20 to 25 years, during which I
                have been involved in local government and in politics, my
                colleagues in Lisburn and I fought against Tory efforts to shift
                the goalposts and run down the services in Lagan Valley
                Hospital. In future, a Minister from the Ulster Unionist Party,
                the SDLP, the Democratic Unionist Party or Sinn Fein might take
                these so-called difficult decisions. Having fought the Tories
                for a quarter of a century, I will fight any of those parties in
                order to retain the service to which the people of Lisburn have
                become accustomed.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Boyd:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister. The people of the
                Northern Board area are being presented with a fait accompli
                and, as a consequence, alternative patterns of service and
                service models have not been properly explored. It is now being
                proposed that Whiteabbey Hospital be downgraded from an acute
                hospital to a non-acute hospital with adverse implications for
                the people of Newtownabbey, Carrickfergus and Larne. The
                Northern Ireland Information Service’s press statement of
                10&nbsp;December said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We have had extensive and unprecedented
                consultations with Assembly Members, local politicians,
                councillors, et cetera.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I appreciate that the Minister has held
                meetings with us, it is clear that the Northern Health Board and
                the Health Minister are pursuing their policy before the elected
                representatives of the Assembly, who live in our community, are
                able to assess the whole matter of health.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of three constituencies — North
                Belfast, East Antrim and South Antrim — have said, through
                their representatives, that they do not want their hospitals to
                be downgraded. Instead they want the coronary care units and
                accident and emergency services to be retained to deal with
                their highly populated areas. Like Mr&nbsp;Close’s
                constituency, Newtownabbey is also growing in population. We
                have an international airport, a university and many factories.
                We want to see capital investment in Whiteabbey and other local
                hospitals, not down-grading.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I propose that any service changes should be
                underpinned by the following principles. All current services
                identified for future provision from the Whiteabbey site should
                continue to operate throughout any transitional period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ambulance Service must have sufficient,
                appropriately equipped vehicles and trained staff to enable
                swift response and rapid transfer to consultant-led accident and
                emergency service. Issues related to public transport must be
                resolved prior to the relocation of any services. Any changes
                must have the full support of the local general practitioners,
                some of whom are very vociferous in the campaign to save
                Whiteabbey Hospital; and finally, the local community must
                continue to be consulted on any proposed changes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last Monday Roger Hutchinson, my Colleague
                from East Antrim, and I spent three hours in Muckamore Abbey
                Hospital. To see those staff working night and day, sometimes
                with only five or six members of staff to cope with over
                30&nbsp;patients was probably one of the most moving experiences
                I have ever had — they do a tremendous job.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As my Colleague Oliver&nbsp;Gibson has also
                stated, sometimes patients who have been in hospital for up to
                25&nbsp;years are going to be put back into the community. Their
                families, who are very loving and caring, are being asked to
                take on this task of helping to uproot these patients from the
                environment which they have been used to for a lifetime. The
                manager of Muckamore&nbsp;Abbey Hospital said that the only way
                in which they could make ends meet was to close down two wards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No more hospitals should have to close their
                wards to make ends meet. I ask the Minister to make arrangements
                to visit Muckamore Abbey. I endorse my Colleague
                Oliver&nbsp;Gibson’s comment that we should save Muckamore
                Abbey Hospital and allocate sufficient money to allow it to
                continue operating.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will give Members an example that will show
                them why I feel strongly that the local hospital at Whiteabbey,
                and others, should not lose their acute status. Twice in five
                years my mother has, sadly, had a heart attack. On the first
                occasion she was taken into Whiteabbey, stabilised overnight and
                transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital. The second time was
                in February this year. The GP at Whiteabbey Health Centre
                arranged for her to be admitted to Whiteabbey Hospital on the
                Friday for tests. Unexpectedly on the Monday night, she suffered
                a massive heart attack — and I am thankful — Whiteabbey
                Hospital was able to save her life. The next day she was sent to
                the Royal Victoria Hospital for a life-saving operation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The surgeons in the Royal said that but for
                Whiteabbey Hospital’s coronary care facility she would have
                died. She is enjoying as good a lifestyle now as she has had for
                many years. I challenge anybody to tell me that the case for
                closing the coronary care unit of Whiteabbey Hospital has been
                made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I have no objection to, in fact I
                would welcome, a regional cancer centre for
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland but, as someone who has worked in a
                financial environment for 18&nbsp;years, I know that
                &quot;centre of excellence&quot; can sometimes be a fancy term
                for cost-cutting. I hope and trust that this matter is given
                full consideration before any decision is reached, and I hope
                that no decision is made by the Minister before locally elected
                representatives become responsible for such decisions.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to welcome the Minister to the
                Assembly. Members have said &quot;Yes, we are going to have to
                do something about the hospitals, as long as it is not our
                hospital. Yes, we are going to have to do something about the
                Health Service, as long as the Minister gives more money to my
                constituency.&quot; These are political and strategic decisions
                that cannot be put on the long finger and which Members will
                have to face.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reorganisation of the Health Service is
                going to be one of the most difficult decisions that Assembly
                Members will have to make. The money is decreasing, not
                increasing, and certainly not keeping pace with the expenditure
                that is required for patients and for those in the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I once heard the expression &quot;The
                operation was a success; it is too bad the patient died.&quot;
                One of my concerns about this document is that it is very much
                led by the Royal College. It is right that we train our doctors
                in specialist functions and that we have the best clinical
                effectiveness available. However, hospitals are also about the
                care of very sick people, not just the specialist treatment of a
                few. I have concerns that, if the Royal College were to lead the
                consultation process, all other voices that are so important to
                the discussion would come much further down on the list of the
                people to whom you have to listen. The Royal College is a very
                powerful body.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned too that we are talking over
                and over again about acute health services and care. We know
                that, with better prevention, we might not be having this
                debate. In this respect, Northern&nbsp;Ireland lags sadly behind
                the rest of the United Kingdom. Only around 2% of our budget
                goes on health prevention. We must take this area of health much
                more seriously.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This brings me to a very important point
                about community-based services. We have heard from Oliver
                Gibson, from a Member of the United Kingdom Unionist Party, from
                Dr&nbsp;Hendron and from others about the importance of
                community-based services. Figures from the comprehensive
                spending review were placed in Members pigeon-holes at
                lunchtime. Was that to remind us of the amount of money? We had
                not forgotten.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is very important is that so little of
                the money is going to community care. We desperately need
                respite care and continuity care, particularly for the elderly
                who are being decanted at far too fast a rate out of geriatric
                units because there are no beds. Nursing homes are closing down
                because they are not meeting the health and safety regulations.
                Where are these elderly people going to be cared for?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly the Minister has got to make a
                decision now on how the cake gets carved up. It seems that the
                budget has not reached the right places. Attention has been too
                much focussed upon the provision of acute hospital services.
                This is an argument which we must get right in order that the
                people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland have ownership of the decision
                on where these hospitals are to be located. I share
                Mr&nbsp;Foster’s concern about the west of the Bann. It is
                right that the area’s representatives should raise the issue
                of the rural community’s reaction to this debate. I offer them
                my support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be remiss of me, as a representative
                of the Women’s&nbsp;Coalition, if I did not say that most of
                the job losses will be women’s. Those who do the catering,
                cleaning and nursing — including the auxiliary staff — are
                predominately women.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How are we going to manage the transfer of
                jobs? Are we, under the Labour Administration, going to face
                increasing unemployment in the one area of the public sector
                where the lot of both Catholics and women improved in terms of
                the number of jobs available? Angels fearing to tread will
                become angels failing to tread. Again the argument lies around
                nursing and the remuneration of nursing, which is appalling
                given the enormous risks that nursing staff take day and daily.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to have a much clearer discussion
                about the Ambulance Service. It is painful for me to recall
                having seen an example of this at first hand. Two years ago, on
                a winter night in a rural area on a very lonely country road, my
                sister had the most appalling road traffic accident. The driver
                of the other car was killed instantly. My sister survived
                because a rural ambulance managed to get there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She was taken to the hospital in Coleraine
                where a surgeon carried out the almost impossible task of
                putting her on a life-support system — she had punctured both
                lungs, which is a life-threatening condition. However, the most
                important outcome of all of that — I learnt much in those two
                days around the Health Service — was that she had to be
                transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital where she got
                specialist attention in orthopaedic care.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern&nbsp;Ireland has moved very far in
                the last few years in not just bringing the solution to the
                problem, but in looking at the continuum of what is then needed
                to bring the problem to the solution. That night the problem was
                brought to the local hospital and later to the regional
                specialist hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do need to get it right. We must keep up
                with the rest of the world with our Ambulance Service and
                experienced paramedics. The coronary care units must be local.
                What happens if there is a crucial aneurysm that needs
                specialist attention? That is the kind of attention we need to
                pay to the Health Service: we need to take the problems to the
                solutions but also make sure that the solutions are available
                locally for emergencies that are life-threatening.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr&nbsp;Hendron rightly points us to
                solutions elsewhere — they do not have to be just here in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. I am aware of the dermatological
                telemedicine centre and of how skin disease can be diagnosed in
                the Republic of Ireland simply by screening through the services
                of a doctor in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. That is the kind of
                service that we should be looking at, Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                should not be working in isolation but building good
                communications and good technological services North and South.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now I want to raise an important issue which
                concerns me, and that is who the Minister responsible will be. I
                would like it to be the Minister responsible for health and
                social services. Recently I was concerned at what I thought was
                a mistake when I read in the ‘Belfast Telegraph’ that
                &quot;housing and social services&quot; were to be a designated
                departmental body. I would be completely opposed to that. People
                have come from all round the world — health and social service
                experts — to study the one unique service that we have here,
                and that is the integration of health and social services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our problems are not always purely physical;
                they can also be social — it is the integration of that care
                that has made us one of the foremost bodies in the field. I
                would like us to continue down that road rather than enter some
                kind of separate, functional silo by putting health in one
                department and social services elsewhere. I welcome this report.
                The Minister’s hands have been tied where expenditure has been
                concerned, and I welcome the increases in the comprehensive
                spending review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Could the Minister tell us how Northern
                Ireland is faring in relation to Scotland, England and Wales in
                terms of the increase in the budget? A great deal has been made
                of how the Minister won extra increases for the Health Service,
                but I remain concerned about new legislation such as the
                Children’s Order and the other problems that I have
                highlighted. Are we keeping up or are we now falling behind,
                like the other regions of the United Kingdom?</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us not forget the enormous amount of
                informal community care that people in Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                have given voluntarily. This needs to be recognised in any
                debate. My final plea to the Minister is to take on board the
                problems we have raised here and ensure that the debate is as
                wide-ranging as possible and not led just by the articulate,
                elite few.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister here today, and I
                welcome and support the broad thrust of the document, in
                particular the recognition of the need for debate and for us to
                work out a vision for the Health Service in five years’, ten
                years’, 20&nbsp;years’ time, analysing where we are now and
                how we are going to go where we want to go. Strategic thinking
                is the key to this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health-care provision goes to the heart of
                politics, it goes to the heart of government, and it goes to the
                very heart of the ethos of the kingdom — namely,
                cradle-to-the-grave health care free for everybody. That is a
                basic right of all citizens of the kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are some startling admissions that the
                hospital services are facing a critical time, that there is a
                risk that some may break down and that standards of care are not
                as good as they should be. It is for us in the Assembly, all
                things being equal, to debate and make the decisions on the way
                forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise that the Minister’s inheritance
                is an unenviable one after 19&nbsp;years of a Conservative
                Government which took the view that health provision was about
                working out what funds were available and then ascribing them to
                the health service rather than working out what the need was and
                how that need should be addressed. I welcome the abolition of
                the internal market, fulfilling a promise made by the Labour
                Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a need to take an holistic approach
                Province-wide and also to pay attention to local needs. We
                cannot say that money does not matter. We have to manage local
                budgets — for example. Because of the lack of funding in the
                Eastern Health and Social Services Board area, in October, there
                were 149&nbsp;people on the waiting list for community-care
                packages and 100&nbsp;people in hospital taking up valuable
                hospital beds because community care was not available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a representative of South Belfast I must
                ask the Minister about the decision to close the Jubilee
                maternity unit in the City Hospital. I believe that that is a
                bad decision. It concerns us in the Assembly, and we will call
                on reports from experts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A couple of years ago we got one such report,
                the McKenna Report, which after wide-ranging consultation
                decided that the Jubilee maternity unit should stay. This is a
                knock-on effect from the decision to centralise the cancer unit
                at the City Hospital. The sale of the Belvoir Hospital site will
                pay for this move. McKenna made a simple recommendation that
                Jubilee take over two floors of the tower block because the need
                in south Belfast demanded that the Jubilee stay. In that area
                there are 30,000 women of childbearing age. Currently the
                Jubilee deals with an average of 2,800&nbsp;births per annum. It
                has an intensive care unit for 350 to 400&nbsp;babies per annum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A new report by Donaldson, without
                consultation and almost secretly, recommends the closure of this
                very valuable unit. That was a bad decision. It means that women
                in south Belfast will have to go to the Royal Victoria Hospital
                in west Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Royal Victoria Hospital is presently
                working at its full capacity of 3,000&nbsp;births
                per&nbsp;annum. Occasionally the hospital has to send expectant
                mothers to the City Hospital. That is an example of a local
                decision which defies logic and rationality and it also flies in
                the face of economic sense. The Jubilee set-up in the City
                Hospital means that we do not have to spend money on new
                buildings. We can simply move it into two floors in the Tower
                block. The staff and equipment are there, and such a move seems
                sensible, reasonable and rational. It is unfortunate that
                decisions such as this are being made prior to the Assembly
                taking over responsibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister spoke of putting it right and
                gave his vision of the future, but it should be left to the
                Assembly to make those decisions. The Minister should review his
                decision, or at least defer implementing it until the Assembly
                becomes responsible for these matters. If that is not done the
                Royal&nbsp;Victoria Hospital, which is already working at full
                capacity, will be required to take on a further
                2,800&nbsp;pregnancies. That is an impossible task, and mothers
                in south Belfast will be forced to go to the
                Ulster&nbsp;Hospital or to Lagan&nbsp;Valley, should the
                concerns of Mr&nbsp;Close be borne out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an important document, but it is
                merely the first stage in what will be important business for
                the Assembly. Difficult decisions will have to be made by local
                politicians who will not be able to hide behind a
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland Office Minister.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister to the Assembly and I
                welcome his opening remarks. I should like to put on record the
                thanks of our community for the additional finance for the
                Health Service to reduce waiting lists and ease problems in
                other areas. This document deals only with hospital services,
                and the Minister says that it represents his vision of the
                future of hospital services in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. The
                purpose of the document is to</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;offer information, advice and
                assistance to the Assembly&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">and presumably to the wider community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall speak in the context of hospital
                services, and not on wider aspects of the Health Service, such
                as community care or ill-health prevention. The document states
                that it is important that care be delivered close to the patient’s
                home. The document also states that the provision of care is
                best when there is a sensible balance between accessibility of
                services and the provision of modern high-quality standards of
                clinical expertise. We all subscribe to those sentiments and
                most of us would agree that the Minister, the Department, the
                boards, the trusts and the practitioners want to provide the
                best possible health service. What is in dispute is how to
                achieve that. I do not agree with a great deal of the substance
                and conclusions of the document because they do not seem to
                match the vision and aspiration of the opening paragraphs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his opening remarks the Minister said that
                this was not about expenditure, and I accept that it was not
                about closing hospitals, but I question that, because when an
                engine is taken out of a motorcar and replaced by a foot pedal,
                have you still got a motorcar? That is the question. If the
                engine is taken out of an acute service hospital, is that still
                a meaningful hospital?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As anticipated for those listed in annex A,
                the asterisked exceptions, where services, such as general
                medicine, general surgery, obstetrics, paediatrics, gynaecology
                and accident and emergency, are taken out, what is left —a
                glorified GP polytech surgery? That will be the fate of many of
                the 12 mentioned in appendix A. There is no doubt about that,
                should the vision, stated in appendices A, B, and C, be put into
                practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, I draw my conclusions from the
                experience suffered, over the years, by my community at the
                Downe Hospital. In the Assembly, it is not appropriate to be
                parochial and simply deal with my home base, but what is
                happening there could be the blueprint for others. At the
                beginning of the document there is a paragraph that says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;some of our smaller hospitals are at
                risk of collapse.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the reasons for the risk is the
                uncertainty with which they have been visited time and again
                over the past two to three decades.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The confidence and morale of staff and
                patients have been undermined, and that is something we must put
                to bed once and for all. The providers of our health care are
                the Minister, the Department, the health boards, the trusts, the
                practitioners, specialist or general. Of course, the patients
                are also the customers. It is the practitioners and the patients
                who should make decisions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, the decisions are often made
                only by the first three — the Department, the boards and the
                trusts. The experience of those working at the coalface and the
                recipients are often not taken into account, and that needs to
                be dealt with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two years ago the Department, the Minister,
                the board, the trust, the local practitioners and the community
                assessed the requirements for Downe Hospital and were advised to
                seek private finance. The Department approved the case but, lo
                and behold, private finance was no longer deemed to be suitable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Was that judgement made on medical or
                financial grounds? Nothing had changed except the Department’s
                attitude. The board as the purchasers, the trust as the
                providers, the practitioners as the deliverers and the patients
                as the recipients were all still of the same mind. Only
                &quot;little Johnny&quot;, the Department, &quot;was out of
                step&quot;. One must question whether that decision was taken on
                medical service grounds or whether something else, such as
                finance — a dirty word — came in to play. That is the only
                thing that changed. Everyone else, except the Department, said
                that things were the same. We entered another series of reviews
                and the Minister’s predecessor, Mr&nbsp;Worthington, decided
                to take a direction not a million miles away from the direction
                of this particular document.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The curious thing was that the six options
                presented by Mr&nbsp;Worthington for consultation did not
                include any of the options that he adopted. Have we had
                consultation then? The jury may be de facto. But that took place
                without regard for the people concerned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Minister for his endeavours and
                do not intend to diminish them in any way — for instance, he
                has reviewed the case, he has visited the hospital and he has
                listened to delegations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the then Minister, Mr&nbsp;Worthington,
                made his decision he was challenged and reports were submitted
                and references were drawn to changing requirements in at least
                three different fields. In May to July last the joint working
                party of the Royal College of Surgeons, jointly with the British
                Medical Association, the Carter Review for the provision of
                hospital services in rural and urban areas of Scotland, and even
                the members of the Royal College of Obstetricians — which
                denied in a sense the basis upon which the previous decision was
                made — were put into the melting pot again, and no change took
                place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw this parallel in detail because this
                is the sort of scenario that may be visited on other local
                hospitals. The previous Minister’s decision has been
                confirmed, and a special press release was issued four days ago
                in which the Minister asked the board to review hospital
                provision in the area in the light of ‘Putting it Right’ and
                to report their findings by March.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we do not know the parameters of the
                new business case. Is it the one which previously went to public
                consultation and to a private finance initiative inquiry and
                which was endorsed by all concerned, or is it a new one promoted
                by the then Minister, Mr&nbsp;Worthington, or is it yet another
                new thing promoted by the Department and launched as this
                document? Those are the questions which we must address, as must
                the rural areas outside the conurbations of Belfast, Derry and
                Craigavon. That is why I make no apology for raising it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Worthington made two positive points
                when making his decision. First, he said &quot;We will build a
                new hospital in Down&quot;. Secondly, he said &quot;No major
                changes to services provided in the Downe are planned until the
                new hospital opens.&quot; Yet the rundown of this hospital,
                through undermining and the creation of a crisis, is well under
                way. The community in rural Down and in other rural areas need
                to know exactly what &quot;business case&quot; is going to be
                applied.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to listen to the people
                and to the practitioners. They are the deliverers, they are the
                receivers, and they are the people who should be satisfied
                primarily. There should be accessibility tempered with technical
                effectiveness.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister to the Assembly, and I
                thank him for his prompt responses to my letters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My first question is about the Ambulance
                Service, specifically in the Ards Peninsula. The ‘Putting it
                Right’ document talks about making it happen. It says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The development of a highly effective
                Ambulance Service must be integral to the new
                arrangements.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to illustrate the specific problems
                which the Ambulance Service has in my area. The roads of the
                Ards Peninsula are twisty, narrow, difficult to negotiate and
                the dangers are obvious.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ambulance Service response time, as
                stated in the citizen’s charter, is 18 minutes. On a number of
                occasions in the last few months, the response time from
                Portaferry has been 28 minutes, and in one instance in Kircubbin,
                it was 24 minutes. This was an ambulance coming from Newtownards
                to Kircubbin — a distance of 11&nbsp;miles. I am sure the
                Minister would agree that no matter how bad the roads are,
                24&nbsp;minutes is not a satisfactory response time in which to
                deal with an emergency — in this case a child who had been
                taken ill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem does not lie with the Ambulance
                Service or the crews; they are very efficient and have the
                necessary ability and experience. The problem is the fact that
                the Ambulance Service cannot cope with the poor-quality roads on
                the Ards Peninsula.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For many years, elected representatives have
                lobbied for an outstation in the Ards Peninsula. Can the
                Minister give an assurance that an outstation will be built at
                either Ballywalter or Kircubbin, thus providing constituents in
                the Ards Peninsula with an effective Ambulance Service which
                meets the standard laid down in the citizen’s charter?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My second point is in relation to the
                accident and emergency services, specifically those in the
                Ulster&nbsp;Hospital at Dundonald. The Minister is aware of the
                many stories about its accident and emergency services, and
                Members have been trying to address these issues directly with
                the Department and with the hospital service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard stories about people who have
                had to spend up to 18 hours lying on a trolley and about people
                who have had a lengthy wait in a cubicle — indeed, one lady
                from Portavogie was forgotten about. How could anybody in a
                cubicle in the Ulster&nbsp;Hospital be forgotten about? It is
                hard to believe, but it happened. All these things have happened
                because of the shortage of beds and lack of money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister tell Members how he intends
                to address the very serious problems that exist in relation to
                accident and emergency services in the Ulster&nbsp;Hospital?
                These problems have nothing to do with the staff who are pushed
                and under a great deal of pressure. The service needs more
                staff, more beds and more money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Would the Minister also like to comment on
                information that was given to me yesterday, namely that the
                accident and emergency service in the Ulster Hospital may be
                relocated, in the short term, to the Ards Hospital, because the
                Ulster&nbsp;Hospital cannot cope with the demands?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that services should
                always follow demographic trends? The population of Strangford
                has increased by 16% in the last 10&nbsp;years. This
                demonstrates that people are moving away from the Greater
                Belfast area and into country areas. Consequently, greater
                demands are being placed on services there. I suggest to the
                Minister and his Department that services should be moved to
                where the people are.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too would like to welcome John&nbsp;McFall
                for this very important debate. It is obvious from contributions
                made by the representatives of all the political parties that
                they were articulating in a very heartfelt way their
                constituents’ concerns about the current state of the health
                service and what it might be in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the document ‘Putting it
                Right’ and its vision of the future — and this is an
                important point for me — in recent times the Health Service in
                the North has been driven by bodies like the British Government,
                the Royal College of Surgeons, and the four health boards which
                have been established in the North.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been a totally lopsided approach to
                the issue of health, as is clear from the reaction of people in
                County&nbsp;Tyrone regarding the south Tyrone Hospital; in south
                Derry regarding the Mid-Ulster Hospital; in south Down and in
                other parts of the North. The people who depend on hospital
                services have been absent from the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government must take notice, just as we
                have had to take notice when we saw 20,000 to 30,000 people on
                the streets in south Down, in Dungannon and in other parts of
                the North. There is something seriously wrong when there is such
                a turnout of people objecting to the way hospital services are
                directed. People feel that this is an issue over which they have
                very little control.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was clear to me, in the course of the
                Assembly elections, that, for the first time, people in the
                North of Ireland, certainly in the constituency that I
                canvassed, felt a sense of empowerment that at last hospital
                services were going to be in the hands of the local community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened to this debate and to the
                smart alecs in the media who say that it remains to be seen
                whether, on the transfer of power, we will be prepared to take
                the tough decisions. My party is not afraid of tough decisions,
                and there are representatives here from other parties who are
                also not afraid. We want to take those decisions against the
                background of a complete review of hospital services in the
                North, including the views of the Royal College of Surgeons and
                the health boards — or what remains of the boards after the
                Assembly Executive takes control. The views of the people who
                are directly affected by the hospital services — patients and
                potential patients — should also be sought.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People who voted in the Assembly elections
                voted for the fullest implementation of the Good Friday
                Agreement as a matter of urgency. We have come here today to
                raise matters with the Minister, and while we may have
                criticisms of the Government’s approach — and we certainly
                do — it is also fair to criticise the failure of the Assembly
                to provide, for example, a shadow Health Minister, and a shadow
                Committee on Health for the people who voted in the referendum
                and in the Assembly elections.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly has failed those people
                dismally. If we had in place a shadow Assembly Committee on
                Health and a shadow Minister of Health, we would be much more
                powerful in our debate with the British Government about the
                future of health services in the North. We would be much more
                relevant, instead of coming here today and listening to people
                with quite legitimate concerns about Whiteabbey Hospital,
                Lagan&nbsp;Valley Hospital, South Tyrone Hospital, the
                Mid-Ulster Hospital and hospital services in south&nbsp;Down. We
                have to get our act together, and we have to provide leadership.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is much concern among people that,
                through the downgrading of hospitals such as Whiteabbey,
                South&nbsp;Tyrone, Mid-Ulster and others, they are being
                softened up. We are being conditioned to accept, in the future,
                a hospital service which will revolve around the golden circle
                of six hospitals, the rest being reduced to the status of
                glorified health centres.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document mentions no hospital closures,
                but I do not think it is being honest. Members are experienced
                politicians, and it appears to me that we are talking about
                hospital closures —ultimately, the closure of the South Tyrone
                Hospital and the Mid-Ulster Hospitals. This will not be within
                the next 12&nbsp;months, maybe not even within the next two or
                three years, but ultimately, the way things are going, this is
                what we are talking about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation west of the Bann is a massive
                issue. Many people feel that discrimination is taking place,
                particularly when one considers that of the &quot;golden
                circle&quot; of six hospitals, four or five are within a 30-mile
                radius of Belfast, the other being Altnagelvin in Derry City. If
                one were to draw a line across the map from Derry, through South
                Derry, into county Tyrone to the Ballygawley roundabout, one
                would see that there is not one &quot;golden circle&quot;
                hospital to deal with the needs of this rural area. There is
                something badly wrong with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened with sympathy to what Mr&nbsp;McGimpsey
                said about maternity services being lost at the Jubilee
                Hospital, but people in that area can use another hospital
                100&nbsp;yards away. However, in the last month maternity
                services have been withdrawn from the South Tyrone Hospital
                meaning that people have to travel up to 40&nbsp;miles to
                Craigavon Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is something seriously wrong, and it
                affects my constituency of Mid Ulster. For example, if there
                were to be a tragedy in the Pomeroy area, particularly given the
                state of the roads around Toomebridge — and there will be no
                bypass there for four or five years — people would have to lie
                in an ambulance for an hour to an hour and a half. That is
                absolutely mad, and the sooner Members get to grips with these
                issues, the sooner the great fears and concerns of our
                constituents can be dealt with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr&nbsp;McGimpsey that health
                boards and the British Government should not be taking decisions
                on the rundown of services at any of these hospitals until a
                Health Minister, or Shadow Health Minister, is appointed by the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ultimately, I would like to see all the
                political parties in the Assembly deal soberly with our many
                difficulties in a Health Committee. That is a job for us; we
                will not shirk our responsibilities; and we are not afraid to
                make unpopular decisions. Weight needs to be given to the views
                of the tens of thousands of members of the public who are
                frightened by the way in which they are being treated — their
                voices are absent from this debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Royal College of Surgeons, the four
                health boards and the Government need to take on board the views
                of the elected representatives and the marching feet that we are
                going to see more of in the coming weeks. People in the South
                Tyrone area are disgusted at the removal of maternity services
                in the South Tyrone Hospital, and in the course of the coming
                months they will see a further debilitating situation developing
                at their hospitals. We are critical of the rundown in health
                services and of the way in which the review has taken place.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McGrady talked about being parochial.
                I intend to be parochial on a specific issue, the major issues
                having been dealt with well by other Members. I trust that the
                Minister is aware of the many valid concerns that constituents
                in West Tyrone and Fermanagh/South Tyrone have about their
                future health-care —</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a service which guarantees equally high
                quality care to everyone in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, no matter
                where they live.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson referred to the closure of
                hospitals in Castlederg and Strabane, an area which I know well.
                In that area, there are also many concerns about whether the
                co-operatives, which local GPs have organised, are operating
                effectively. People in the area may face journeys of up to
                30&nbsp;miles for after-hours services and weekend services.
                People are also concerned about the Ambulance Service. The crews
                are doing a great job, but we need to be sure that they are
                based in the right places to cover the relevant area. Recently,
                in my area, an ambulance had to travel from Enniskillen to
                Castlederg in response to a call-out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s report has not &quot;put it
                right&quot; for those who rely on the services that are provided
                by the Erne and Tyrone County Hospitals. A lack of vision on the
                future of these two hospitals has caused great concern among
                local people. They have been left in limbo, and the report gives
                a choice of either the Erne Hospital or Tyrone County Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report says that decisions of this kind
                could be made by the Assembly. However, the Assembly could have
                made a different decision, rather than simply choosing one or
                other of those hospitals. The Erne and Tyrone County Hospitals
                are currently run by the Sperrin Lakeland Trust as a combined
                unit, and together represent the seventh largest hospital unit
                in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, covering over 20% of the land area of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland and providing a service for more than 15%
                of the population.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said that I would be parochial on this
                matter, and that is quite a parish! Demography is more than
                simply a number of people, and a proper study of the demography
                of the area should lead to the clear conclusion that to retain
                only one or other of those hospitals would be inadequate.
                Mention has been made of the golden six hospitals. Could this
                not have been the lucky seven?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On page 14 the document states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;While acknowledging the advantages of
                larger hospitals, these are significantly outweighed by the
                disadvantages for patients in terms of accessibility.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why does the report not consider the
                retention of those two hospitals as a single unit — that is,
                both hospitals operating together with complementary specialist
                services available in each, and with accident and emergency
                services available in the two county towns, Omagh and
                Enniskillen.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like also to refer to the situation
                west of the Bann, and, in particular, to the situation in south
                and east Tyrone and south Derry. Two of the hospitals which will
                clearly be affected by these decisions lie in that area, namely
                in my constituency of Mid Ulster. They are the South Tyrone in
                Dungannon and the Mid-Ulster in Magherafelt.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all know that not all of the
                17&nbsp;existing acute hospitals will escape change. There has
                to be change, and change is vital to maintain or improve
                standards of medical care, and the improvement in the standards
                of medical care is the most important consideration in this
                debate. Our citizens are entitled to the very highest quality of
                service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, even though the improvement in
                medical standards is by far the most important factor in this
                debate, it is not the only factor. The availability and
                accessibility of services are also matters of serious concern,
                as is the best use of existing resources. The integration of
                Health Service provision into our comprehensive development
                strategy for the entire region is another concern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That brings me to my first charge. The
                Department of Health and Social Services Ministers — not so
                much Mr&nbsp;McFall, but his predecessors over a period — must
                stand indicted for their failure to produce a comprehensive
                strategy for the development of acute service provision in a way
                that is geographically fair and maximises accessibility and
                availability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only their monumental failure to do so
                explains how it is that five of the six hospitals that have been
                chosen to provide the extensive ranges of acute in-patient
                services form a cluster within a 30-mile radius of Belfast. The
                sixth one is in Derry city, the farthest point north-west.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand and accept the need for a degree
                of concentration. But concentration on the periphery is not the
                centralisation of services, which is what the Royal Colleges
                have called it. The concentration of services in a fair and
                evenly distributed way across the whole community is what is
                needed. The Department of Health and Social Services has not
                devised a strategy for such provision, and it must stand
                indicted for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That brings me to my second, more specific,
                charge. Over the years, many of us have been critical of the
                various health and social services boards whose members are
                unelected. There is a widely-held view that they have shown a
                good deal of insensitivity to public opinion and to the
                representations of local politicians. I want to single out the
                Southern Health and Social Services Board for its recent
                decision to close the maternity unit in the South Tyrone
                Hospital in Dungannon, and for the way in which that decision
                was reached.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For many years, the surgeons in Dungannon
                have been pleading for the appointment of paediatric consultants
                to provide cover for its maternity unit. Other hospitals with
                similar birth rates each year have two or three paediatricians
                to provide such cover. Board representatives have argued that
                they made every effort but could not succeed in providing the
                cover.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of those who are close to the hospital
                and have fought its cause dispute that. The inactivity of the
                Southern Board over time led inexorably to the situation which
                arose a couple of weeks ago. Surgeons at the hospital, at long
                last and quite properly, pointed out that they simply could not
                carry on without paediatric cover. The reaction of the board was
                not to provide the cover but to close the unit. I charge the
                Southern board with contriving to bring about that situation. I
                believe that it was always its strategy to downgrade or close
                the South Tyrone Hospital.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The decisions made by the Southern Board over
                the years which led inexorably to that situation must be
                intensively scrutinised. Consequently, along with the MP for
                Fermanagh and South Tyrone, I have initiated a cross-community
                complaint to the Ombudsman. We invite other MPs and Assembly
                Members to join us in sponsoring this complaint, and we will
                make it available in a number of centres in the area served by
                the South Tyrone Hospital so that the general public may sign.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unelected quangos should not be immune from
                being scrutinised by those empowered and equipped to do so. The
                Department of Health and Social Services should also be made to
                answer for its failure to produce a fair and equitable strategy
                for the provision of acute in-patient services in a way that
                gives reasonable and fair access to the whole of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. They should answer to the charge of
                conniving at, if not devising the strategy to aggrandise the
                lucky hospitals which were eventually chosen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that it will not be long before this
                Assembly takes on the reins of power; however, it may be
                February, March or even April before that happens, and a lot of
                damage can be done in that time. Wrong decisions made by
                unelected quangos now could cost a lot to put right when it
                becomes our responsibility to do so, and, therefore, I urge the
                Minister to freeze any further decision making until this
                Assembly, through its Minister and its Departmental Committee,
                has an opportunity to devise a fair and equitable strategy for
                the delivery of acute in-patient services across the region.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister but, unlike others, I
                do not necessarily welcome this document. It has neither the
                right tenor nor the right agenda for the future of hospital
                services throughout the Province. Many Members clearly supported
                the document or rejected it. Some welcomed it; some are sitting
                smugly because their hospital has been saved or upgraded, and,
                therefore, this does not bother them. They welcome the approach
                that has been taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Others who represent areas where hospital
                provision is under serious threat — and this document does
                nothing to allay those fears — far from being smug, are
                concerned about the health and welfare of our constituents as we
                approach the end of this century and go into the next. We
                approach that next century not with hope, not looking forward to
                the health provisions that are being made, but with deep
                concern. I understand those views.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most people expressed their views very
                clearly, but I am confused by the representations made by two
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin Members, both from the Mid Ulster constituency.
                When we read Hansard, I think we will find that one person was
                saying one thing while the other was saying something else. One
                was welcoming the document, while the other seemed to have a
                different opinion. I can assure you that there will be no lack
                of clarity on my position with regard to Mid Ulster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This document is not ill-prepared, as some
                Members have suggested. Its agenda for the future of hospital
                services is very clear, and I do not accept it. I had the
                privilege of representing the district of Omagh and the Tyrone
                County Hospital when it was in the former Mid Ulster
                constituency. I saw maternity services withdrawn from the Tyrone
                County Hospital, and I genuinely believe that that was an
                injustice to the people of Omagh — an injustice that needs to
                be put right. Those services were not necessarily removed on
                medical grounds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If it could have been justified, I was
                certainly open to persuasion, but on top of everything else
                there was a concerted effort of political manoeuvring, and the
                people of Omagh have paid the price for that manoeuvring: the
                loss of their maternity services. I wish the Tyrone County well
                in its efforts to ensure a solid future for that area, because
                it has a vital role to play in the future of Health Service
                provision for that rural community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the document ‘Putting it Right’ the
                Minister, and those who prepared it, have made sweeping and
                idealistic statements about the provision of modern and
                effective hospital services. We are informed that the Minister
                wants</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a service which guarantees equally high
                quality care to everyone in Northern Ireland, no matter where
                they live.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That sounds good — a sweeping statement:
                &quot;no matter where they live.&quot; Members who read the
                document carefully will notice that that phrase occurs over and
                over again, as if that was what this document was going to bring
                about. I suggest that it is doing the very opposite. It is not
                giving equally high quality care to people throughout
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. How can such a statement be justified
                when, in reality, the changes that are being suggested will
                remove or change in one fell swoop 60% of the acute hospital
                services currently provided.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equality of service also involves equality of
                accessibility. The time taken to get to high quality care can be
                a matter of life and death. Why should we accept, west of the
                Bann, the destruction of the excellent acute services that we
                already have at the Mid-Ulster and South Tyrone Hospitals, and
                thereby risk the lives of our constituents? The Minister is
                proposing to give us far less than we have enjoyed until now,
                and far less than is enjoyed by the rest of the Province. That
                is totally unacceptable to my constituents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no pressure whatsoever from the
                community to downgrade the acute services at the Mid-Ulster or
                the South Tyrone. The very opposite is the truth —
                30,000&nbsp;people came onto the streets to oppose such action.
                Surely that is the community saying &quot;No&quot; loudly and
                clearly to downgrading and to the withdrawal of maternity
                services from the South Tyrone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And yet this document suggests that the
                community will not allow the present situation to go on. The
                truth of the matter is that the community is demanding that
                local acute services be provided close to the community, bearing
                in mind the vastness of the rural area that we are talking
                about. This document is saying that if you get sick, race as
                quickly as you can to the east of the Province before it gets
                dangerous. Best of all, do not get sick west of the Bann, for
                you are sure to die. That is ridiculous. What way is that for a
                health service to look after the people of an area? The Minister
                may think that that is funny, but let us take a look at the map
                and talk about geographical accessibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me give an example. At the weekend no
                beds were available in Belfast hospitals. One patient was sent
                from the verge of the city to the Mid-Ulster Hospital in
                Magherafelt. His wife paid a £42 taxi fare to visit him. Today,
                the consultant decided that the man was able to go home, but the
                trust concerned was unwilling to provide an ambulance. He was
                told that he could don his pyjamas and an overcoat and get on a
                bus. He would have had to travel in to the centre of Belfast and
                then get a connection to his home in Newtownabbey.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So his wife had to pay another £42&nbsp;to
                collect her husband from that hospital today and take him home.
                She had to pay a total of £84&nbsp;inside three days. Do
                Members realise that this is an example of the caring service
                that we are going to have in the future? They are taking the
                service from the local community. People are having to travel to
                the service. Is the answer to make it as comfortable as possible
                for the Royal College and consultant to guard their time at the
                expense of the ordinary members of the community? This is an
                example of what is in store for people in the rural areas of
                this Province, if the six golden hospitals receive the approval
                of the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister and his Department to
                ensure that the Assembly is free to take this decision without
                any predetermined plan being put into operation, such as happens
                with non-elected quangos which make certain outcomes inevitable.
                Any independent assessment of the position of the new six golden
                acute hospitals shows that the rural area west of the Bann is
                not only disadvantaged,</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Could you please bring your remarks to a
                close.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">but discriminated against. We have to look
                carefully at the provision of health services, not because of
                the pressure from the British Medical Association or the Royal
                Colleges, but because this document says that the number should
                decrease from six to three. We are on a roller-coaster towards
                contracting the service even further, and those who are sitting
                smugly today had better realise that if they yield to the
                pressure of these professionals their hospital will be under
                threat as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to stop travelling along
                the road that he and his Department are on and to allow the
                Assembly, unshackled by the decisions of unelected boards, to
                make the decisions about future health provision.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Nelis:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. Willie, I might give you
                a third position and confuse you entirely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFall is very welcome, and I want to
                thank him for presenting us with this document, a document that
                needs very careful scrutiny. None of us would disagree with the
                mission statement of ‘Making it Happen’ which promises to
                provide us with a modern, effective hospital service and primary
                care through a community health service which guarantees equally
                high quality care to everyone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know who advised the Minister, but I
                believe that this paper has not been properly thought out and
                that the case for change has not been properly made. The Western
                Board Acute Services Review Committee which has many sub-groups
                and an extensive consultation programme is not due to report
                until 1999. ‘Putting it Right’ upstages that consultation
                process, and I wonder whether those engaged in it will have to
                repeat the exercise.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that the Minister is
                endeavouring to address the crisis in Health Service delivery.
                Market forces dictate health services. Patients are now referred
                to as clients, and hospitals are coming down with men — and a
                few women — carrying briefcases. One of the key issues in the
                document is the Ambulance Service. I welcome the injection of
                much-needed cash to the Ambulance Service, but I hope that it is
                not at the expense of downgrading some of our area hospitals. I
                am concerned that the paper is preoccupied with the notion that
                big is beautiful. &quot;Big&quot; in terms of hospitals and ‘Making
                it Happen’ seems to refer not to the golden six as
                Willie&nbsp;McCrea says, but to the golden two. Excellent
                hospitals they may be with excellent staff and facilities — I
                am talking about the Royal and the City — but they are within
                an area which does not provide services to the majority of
                people west of the Bann.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Ambulance Service review will
                address the crisis in the service which has always been the
                Cinderella of the entire Health Service. In Derry City, where I
                live, ambulance crews have to cover not only the entire city and
                the surrounding areas, but are constantly on call to deal with
                transfers to Belfast. That is because Altnagelvin was not given
                proper financial and medical resources to treat many serious
                illnesses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Frequently, only one ambulance crew is left
                to service Altnagelvin, which is supposed to be an acute
                hospital. Last year in our city there was a serious housefire in
                which parents and two children died because there were not
                enough ambulances to transfer them to hospital. When another
                ambulance eventually arrived, the crew attempted to revive
                people, but without success. Others had to be driven to hospital
                by a policewoman. This is not an isolated incident. In the
                Western area many patients regularly have to be transferred to
                hospitals by taxis and other vehicles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no point in having the best
                facilities at hospitals if patients cannot get to them. I
                welcome the review, but I am also concerned that the review body
                was rather exclusive. For example, it did not include trade
                union members or members of the health councils, although such
                people have hands-on experience of the Ambulance Service and
                certainly would have had a good input to the review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members raised concerns about the
                closure or run-down of maternity services and units. That issue
                is insufficiently addressed in the document. Women who are
                fortunate enough to live near a hospital where maternity
                services have not closed are being discharged from hospital some
                six hours after giving birth. We are all familiar with the case
                of the woman who gave birth about two years ago in her husband’s
                lorry en route from Omagh to Altnagelvin while stuck behind a
                tractor in a queue of traffic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We know of the woman who almost died in
                similar circumstances with a postpartum haemorrhage. The
                maternity services look like replacing the ambulance services as
                the Cinderella of the Health Service. A review of the maternity
                service is needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are other concerns, such as the
                training of highly specialised nurses, who then leave because
                they cannot get a contract, and the managerial structure of
                hospitals. A theatre porter recently told me that he had seven
                superiors. The issue of trust executives is scandalous. They
                have salaries of £92,000&nbsp;per year while nurses, porters,
                auxiliaries, canteen and cleaning staff are all expected to live
                on wages that are well below the poverty level. I urge the
                Minister to give more consideration to this document. I support
                the calls that no decision be made until the Assembly shadow
                Executive and Ministers are in place and we have had further
                time to discuss the issue.</p>

                treatment in the right place at the right time, delivered by the
                right person. No one in this Chamber could possibly disagree
                with those sentiments, but how can we achieve such a goal? There
                are many ideas and suggestions in the Minister’s document, and
                I hope that it contains the answer we are looking for.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On page 5 the document, under the heading
                &quot;Why Change is Necessary&quot;, says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Services in some smaller hospitals are
                being stretched to breaking point. Some patients are currently
                being admitted to hospitals that are not adequately equipped to
                provide the full range of tests and support they need.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How right that is.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Hospital at Dundonald, which is
                one of the major hospitals, has frequently been at breaking
                point. Patients have had to endure the indignity of lying not on
                a bed but on a trolley, and not in a ward but in a corridor, for
                many hours. On occasions, because of the lack of attention,
                patients were taken home to receive some form of comfort. This
                cannot be tolerated. The Strangford constituency, which includes
                the tip of the Ards peninsula, expects, and must have, better.
                The sooner improvements can be made at the Ulster&nbsp;Hospital
                the better.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sooner that improvements at the
                Ulster&nbsp;Hospital can be made the better. I pay tribute to
                the dedicated staff of that hospital, who work under
                tremendously stressful conditions. We can only hope that their
                lot will be dramatically improved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document mentions the new community
                hospitals in Newtownards and Bangor. I welcome those
                developments, which are a response to the withdrawal of acute
                services from Newtownards and Bangor some years ago. I
                appreciate the co-operation of all those who were concerned in
                those ventures, particularly our local general practitioners.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If community hospitals are used and managed
                properly, our people will enjoy better health provision. The
                development of a highly effective ambulance service is vital for
                people in rural areas. Those living on the Ards peninsula could
                be facilitated with an ambulance out-service in the centre of
                the region. I thank the Minister for the document. Things can
                only get better, and the new Assembly will put matters right,
                provided it is given the necessary funding.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr R Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for taking time to speak
                to the Assembly. My colleague Mr&nbsp;Boyd and I met the
                Minister on 19 October. At the meeting I put the case of a
                constituent, Mr&nbsp;Cowden, to the Minister. Mr&nbsp;Cowden’s
                wife had been admitted to the Broadways Nursing Home in Larne.
                Mr&nbsp;Cowden was in another Fold and wanted to be with his
                wife. The Minister looked into the matter, and on
                28&nbsp;October Mr&nbsp;Cowden was moved to the Broadways
                Nursing Home to be with his wife. Sadly, Mr&nbsp;Cowden survived
                for only four weeks. At least he was able to have four weeks
                with his wife, and I want to put on record my thanks to the
                Minister for his help.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many good things and many bad
                things in the report. I represent East Antrim, and I have some
                concerns about the rural part of my constituency. It is
                difficult for people living in Islandmagee to get to Whiteabbey
                Hospital. If the Minister’s proposals for that hospital go
                ahead, the majority of patients will have to travel to Antrim
                area hospital. Many of the proposals in the Government paper
                rely on a good Ambulance Service. I ask the Minister to
                reconsider his plans for Whiteabbey Hospital. Perhaps, as my
                colleague Mr&nbsp;Boyd so ably put it, the Minister should
                listen to people in the area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An ambulance service is central to the
                Minister’s paper and his plans. I do not know whether the
                Minister is aware that an ambulance in Larne with the highest
                mileage in the Province has broken down on several occasions and
                left people stranded. This is not an adequate service, and I am
                delighted that £15&nbsp;million will be put into the Ambulance
                Service, which is central to the working of the new
                organisation.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As there is only one ambulance crew, no one
                should take ill on a Sunday or Monday night in Larne. Should
                there be an emergency in Ballymena or in any other area within
                the constituency, the ambulance crew has to go there first.
                Therefore, if you take sick you have to wait for the ambulance
                to return. That is not an adequate service for the people of
                east Antrim. I ask the Minister to examine the situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ambulance Service and the Northern Health
                Board have promised me that Larne will have two new ambulances
                by the end of December. Perhaps the Minister will check to make
                sure that that happens.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is harrowing to be approached by the
                families of mentally handicapped or disturbed people in
                Muckamore Abbey. Some of them have been there for 30 or
                40&nbsp;years, and it is sad for their relatives to see them put
                out to be looked after in the community after such a long and
                happy time in a place which has become their home. The families
                did not put them there because they did not love them or were
                embarrassed by them. They put them there because the care in
                Muckamore Abbey is second to none. I pay tribute to the doctors
                and the nursing staff who deserve better treatment than the
                proposals suggest. I would ask the Minister to rethink some of
                the proposals for Muckamore Abbey.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister to the Assembly. I am
                sure that after 17&nbsp;speakers he will agree with the
                philosophy of Henry&nbsp;Ford, who said</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much has been covered already, but I should
                like to ask the Minister about the philosophy of the analysis.
                Who were the members of the team involved in this? Many of the
                gaps in the analysis have been pointed out, but I am concerned
                that my constituency is not mentioned and there will not be a
                local hospital in the constituency of North Antrim.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ballymena hospital has been closed, and Moyle,
                Ballycastle and Ballymoney hospitals are not mentioned, yet the
                core philosophy of the analysis is that people will get quality
                care no matter where they live. Local hospitals offer valuable
                short-term respite and palliative care to allow patients to
                recover following surgery or illness. How can that happen in
                North Antrim? Patients would be treated at the acute hospitals,
                but could not return to a local hospital for further recovery
                time. Where do the patients of North Antrim go when they have no
                local hospital?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ballymena Borough Council has been arguing
                since the Waveney Hospital closed for a minor accident and
                emergency unit in the town because if a child cuts his finger in
                school, two teachers have to go with him to Antrim. However, as
                it is not a serious injury the child has to sit there for
                approximately four hours before the injury is attended to. That
                means that two teachers are out of school for half a day, which
                is a loss of their valuable services to the pupils. When the
                hospital trust’s board members talked to the council about
                this matter, they told us that we had to decide whether to have
                cancer care in Antrim or a minor accident unit in Ballymena. It
                is totally unfair for any board member to ask that of a locally
                elected representative. That is a decision for the board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does this document state that that kind of
                charade will not go on in future? Can we take it that there will
                be adequate representation on the boards? I ask this because the
                only member of the United Hospital Trust’s Board who has any
                contact with Ballymena has &quot;formerly Ballymena&quot; in
                brackets after his name. Why are the other members not
                &quot;formerly Belfast&quot; or &quot;formerly Newtownabbey&quot;?
                There is no one on that board from the Ballymena area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many other matters that I could
                raise, but I want to draw to the Minister’s attention the fact
                that this document proposes that Ballymena lose its last
                service. It says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Some changes to services in Ballymena
                are proposed. Assessment and rehabilitation services for older
                people, together with dedicated stroke and orthogeriatric
                services presently at Braid Valley Hospital, would be centred at
                the Antrim Hospital.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">North&nbsp;Antrim in its entirety is to be
                bereft of any of the services proposed in this document. What is
                the philosophy behind the analysis? Who took the decision on
                that? Will there be adequate discussions with us before we
                proceed further with any decisions along that line?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr&nbsp;McFall for his attendance,
                for his interest and for the extra funding that has been
                announced. In doing so, I also want to endorse Mr&nbsp;Coulter’s
                comments. As a son of north Antrim, I agree with him that it is
                time the constituency had a new MP because it has been
                politically neglected all these years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to deal with the important
                issue of the crisis in the Health Service and the response to
                ‘Putting It Right’. A forthcoming report from the four
                Colleges of Surgeons in England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales
                was leaked to a newspaper last week. The report, if true,
                certainly indicates that we are in crisis. According to that
                report, only four of 17&nbsp;acute hospitals meet clinical
                standards. The article stated that because of those failing
                standards, recognition and junior staff will be withdrawn and
                the hospitals will be clinically paralysed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate has come at an appropriate time.
                We need to get to grips with the broad web of crucial issues
                affecting the Health Service. Time and time again we receive
                contradictory documents. The current document is certainly
                acceptable and reasonable and makes a contribution, but it
                follows the recent ‘Fit For Nothing’ document, which had a
                totally different angle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A total lack of clear vision on the overall
                provision of health care is the greatest problem. We need a
                clear set of objectives and practical targets — markers or
                baselines against which we can measure achievements. The
                shifting goal posts have been referred to time and time again in
                the debate. The goal posts are on wheels, and you are never
                quite sure where you are going to kick the next time — they
                are going round and round until some of us are dizzy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Could the Minister tell us whether we in
                Northern Ireland are to have a disease service or a health
                service? This is a fundamental question. Is the Health Service
                here to cure or to try to stall disease for as long as possible,
                or is there to be a realistic Health Service in the twenty-first
                century meaning of the word? If the Department of Health and
                Social Services is engaged in rationing health care, the
                Department should say so openly and not leave it to the
                lengthening hospital queues and to the GPs like myself at the
                coalface to try to stretch £100&nbsp;million of funding to get
                £120 million worth of work. You can stretch it a bit around the
                edges, but it will not stretch that far.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the context of the rationing that is
                taking place, the Department of Health and Social Services must
                stop creating limitless public expectations in the face of very
                significant constraints, because the two just do not fit. We
                should not have a situation in which the sky is the limit in
                terms of what people are entitled to when we do not have enough
                money or enough people to deliver such a service. Until the
                Government put real effort and money instead of lip service into
                new technology and telemedicine, the efforts of GPs will be
                wasted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern&nbsp;Ireland will remain in a
                backwater while everywhere else in the world is at the
                cutting-edge of technology and facing twenty-first century
                problems with that new technology. The Government must stop
                making simple things complicated, and in many cases a very
                simple problem is turned into a very complicated one. The
                Government have to stop creating artificial obstacles merely to
                protect vested self-interest — and there is a lot of that
                around. That creates problems, and the Government have to deal
                with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government need an open and honest
                leadership to drive this health agenda forward. At present it is
                unclear what or who, if anyone, is setting the agenda. It is all
                piecemeal, and the Government must decide whether it is the
                Department of Health and Social Services, the medical
                profession, the administrators, financial constraints, social
                services or political considerations that decide policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly should not have to spend the
                next 10&nbsp;years debating structures, administrators and
                mechanics and paying very limited attention to clinical
                standards or popular choice. People are entitled to some choice.
                Members have to decide if personal choice, people’s feelings
                and clinical standards are more important than structures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I do not agree with all the details of
                ‘Putting it Right’, I welcome the publication because it has
                opened up a debate on the Health Service. However, these
                proposals were rushed out in a pre-emptive response to offset
                the negative report coming from the College of Surgeons. The
                Department of Health and Social Services is not on top of the
                situation, and it needs to get on top of it. This debate affords
                Members the opportunity to begin to focus on, and get to grips
                with, all the complexities in the health and care services.
                Major decisions need to be taken to improve the well-being of
                all our communities, and hospitals are a central element of this
                service. But before dealing with hospitals I would like to touch
                on a couple of other points.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential to have a policy that is
                comprehensive and provides for a totally integrated approach to
                health and social care. When I use the word
                &quot;comprehensive&quot;, I have in mind, and I mean, a
                holistic and proactive approach to health and well-being: an
                approach led from primary care; an approach led at the simplest
                level; and an approach led from the ground up but designed both
                to prevent and to cure illness, with the emphasis on prevention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health promotion and disease prevention must
                be at the core of any Health Service of any distinction. If a
                more effective preventative strategy existed, there would be
                fewer people in hospital. The Health Service is impotent, as far
                as I can see, in the whole campaign on health promotion. We are
                all aware of the lethal impact of cigarette smoking on health
                and its well-proven links with cancer and heart disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should be aware of the massive cost to the
                economy generally and to the Health Service specifically of
                alcohol abuse, but little or nothing has been done about that.
                Time does not permit me to go into detail, but I again emphasise
                that tobacco kills one in six of our population, and is
                responsible for more than 90% of lung cancer deaths.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last year in Northern Ireland 773&nbsp;people
                died from lung cancer. Those are the ones we know about, and
                they did not need to die. They could have lived another
                10&nbsp;years. I have noted in my own practice that people who
                smoke normally die 12 to 15&nbsp;years earlier than their
                non-smoking brothers and sisters. The useful economic activity
                that is lost when they die is just the tip of the iceberg.
                Massive morbidity is associated with smoking.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Time does not permit a listing of chronic ill
                health. Some 25% of hospital beds are occupied every winter
                because of chronic bronchitis and emphysema, both of which are
                smoking related. Those issues need to be dealt with. There is no
                point in having a disease service that provides hospital beds
                for people who have smoked themselves almost to death. There is
                no point in providing such people with death grants. That would
                be not a Health Service but a disease service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prevention is essential, and it is not just
                an individual responsibility. Prevention of illness and the
                promotion of good health are the collective responsibility of
                everyone in Government. Central Government has a key role and a
                moral responsibility in the wider context to pursue policies and
                strategies that promote and ensure good health. Promoting
                healthy living and ensuring a framework of attitudes, laws,
                rules, regulations and policies that enable people to follow a
                healthy lifestyle must be an essential part of any health care
                programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One would think that the debate was on
                hospitals rather than on the Health Service. The Health Service
                began and ended with hospitals. Joe Hendron said that 90% of
                health care is provided at primary level, and it is important to
                realise that that is where all the work is done.</p>

                care. There must be scope for GPs to work closely with
                hospitals. Can new technology and tele-medicine not be made to
                work for us by linking peripheral GPs to district hospitals, and

                Overall vision is lacking, and the tension surrounding the
                provision of hospital services arises because people believe
                that they are losing a service, and that there is nothing to put
                in its place.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome Mr&nbsp;McFall to the Assembly. I
                am not enthusiastic about his document, but that is
                understandable because I am a rural dweller with a rural
                constituency. The document shows that rural dwellers will soon
                be second-class citizens in the Health Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister stated that the future of the
                Health Service would be one of the greatest challenges facing
                this Assembly, and that may well prove to be true. However, by
                the time that the Assembly is in a position to address this
                issue, far-reaching decisions will already have been taken.
                Guidelines in the ‘Putting It Right’ document lead
                inevitably to one conclusion. According to the document and the
                Minister, none of our hospitals will close. They will not close
                today, but it will be death by a thousand cuts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy document concentrates on the
                golden six which are in the populated areas of Northern Ireland.
                Those of us who live in, and represent, rural constituencies
                will not fare so well. Those living in rural areas are fast
                becoming second-class citizens in terms of health-care. The
                document states that smaller hospitals are being stretched to
                breaking point and then proceeds to recommend withdrawal of
                certain services. The South&nbsp;Tyrone Hospital has recently
                had maternity services withdrawn and the rundown is well and
                truly under way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the years the medical and ancillary
                staff in the South&nbsp;Tyrone Hospital have done an outstanding
                job. Page 9 of the document states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Patients must be treated by properly
                trained doctors.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does this imply that this has not been the
                case in the past? If hospitals continue to be run down, it will
                be very difficult to attract staff to work in them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document, on page 11, says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Patients want to be treated close to
                home.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That will not happen as a result of this
                document, not in my area anyway. Local hospitals will constantly
                be under threat and resources will be concentrated on the golden
                six. Rev&nbsp;William&nbsp;McCrea touched on the real point when
                he cited the fact that there are three hospitals in this
                document. Members across the Assembly smiled when he said that,
                but in years to come he will be shown to have been correct.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would draw the Minister’s attention to a
                recent incident when a critically ill cancer patient had to wait
                two and a half hours to be collected from his home in
                Fivemiletown to be taken by ambulance to the Erne Hospital
                because Fivemiletown is situated between Enniskillen and
                Dungannon. This document severely disadvantages communities in
                rural areas, like the Clogher Valley. The rundown of rural
                hospitals will also result in a substantial loss of jobs. It is
                estimated that 200 jobs could be lost in the Dungannon area as a
                result of the removal of maternity services. This document does
                not adequately recognise rural communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like the Minister to take on board
                what I consider to be a glaring omission — there is no mention
                of an Information Technology infrastructure to service the
                various hospitals and primary-care centres. A patient was given
                a scan in a local hospital but, as it could not be interpreted,
                the patient had to go to the Royal on a six-month appointment.
                He had the same scan on an identical machine and had to go to
                the seventh floor and wait one and a half hours. A consultant
                then gave an interpretation which was identical to that given
                six months earlier. On enquiry there was a refusal to operate a
                simple fax machine. If the Minister cannot reply on this point
                today, perhaps he could reply in writing.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M Murphy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat a Chathaoirligh. I also
                welcome the Minister. The document ‘Putting It Right’ is
                exciting and challenging. We do not have the option to wait
                until a new Minister is appointed before we tackle this issue,
                as hospital services are facing a critical time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Health Service is facing a critical
                period, caused by the decisions made by the current British
                Government. There is widespread unease in local communities
                about cut-backs and the general rundown of local hospital
                services. It would have been better if the Minister had
                introduced these plans before the general rundown of acute
                services began. It is a fact that a wide range of services in
                smaller hospitals are being stretched to breaking point.
                Nevertheless, I would like to take this opportunity to pay
                tribute to the services which these hospitals have provided over
                the years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will claim that the standard of
                care in some of these hospitals is not as good as it should be,
                but the fault lies with Mr&nbsp;McFall and his predecessors who
                have failed to make the necessary resources available. We need a
                regional investment plan, to be drawn up as soon as possible, to
                ensure that the proposed capital developments will result in
                hospitals adequately equipped to deliver acute services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of my local hospital, Daisy Hill
                Hospital in Newry — mentioned on page 29 of the document — I
                appeal to the Southern Health and Social Services Board to
                appoint an accident and emergency consultant as a matter of
                urgency. Daisy Hill Hospital urgently needs a CT scanner for its
                accident and emergency department, and I call on the board to
                invest in the necessary facilities. I call on GPs and hospital
                managers to work together to ensure that all the services
                outlined on page 29 of the report are provided. A cross-border
                body should be established to take account of the fact that the
                population of north&nbsp;Louth also lives in the catchment area
                of the hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted to see that there has been
                investment in the Ambulance Service, but, in order for this
                service to be fully effective, we need better roads. The
                Department of the Environment and the Department of Health and
                Social Services should work together to ensure that the road
                network in south Down and south Armagh is improved
                substantially, and should do this as part of an integrated plan
                for the area. If the Downe Hospital is to be closed down, the
                roads must be updated so that the Ambulance Service can provide
                patients with the service that they need but for which they now
                have to travel considerable distances.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for coming here today to
                hear our views. Today’s bulletin from the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland Information Service, under the heading
                Mental Health and Learning Disability Services, states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We [the Government] are committed to
                the development and improvement of services for people with a

                people the dignity to live as individuals in community settings
                rather than be lost souls in large and impersonal
                institutions.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note also that the Government are
                allocating £5&nbsp;million, in addition to the
                £25&nbsp;million already allocated, to the community-care
                budget, to enable boards to meet particular pressures in their
                areas. I welcome that.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I have received a fax today from the
                North and West Belfast and Muckamore Abbey Branch of the public
                service union, UNISON, which says that residents in Muckamore
                Abbey are unhappy, and in some cases suffering, because
                reprofiling in its current form has not been a success.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It says that staffing levels cannot be
                maintained because of the £491,000 which has been taken out of
                the Muckamore Abbey budget and that this poses a serious risk to
                residents, as well as a drop in professional standards of care.
                It goes on to say that there is a serious risk of more upheaval
                to accommodate more ward closures in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further, the union says that the trust’s
                chief executive has instructed the site director to dispose of
                40 members of staff, disregarding the fact that this will pose a
                serious risk to the welfare of the hospital’s patients.
                Finally, and this is very important, it says that there are, as
                predicted, mixed-gender wards and unsuitable groups living in
                care together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that situation, does the Minister
                accept that there are, unfortunately, people living in
                institutions who could not and should not go out to live in the
                community? Can he assure the Assembly that some money will be
                directed to those institutions, such as Muckamore Abbey in my
                constituency, so that the patients to whom I refer can live and
                enjoy the same dignity inside the institutions as others living
                with their families in the community?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to
                speak in this debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to raise the matter of the Lagan
                Valley Hospital in my constituency, which Mr&nbsp;Close has
                referred to. The Minister’s vision for the future sees Lagan
                Valley as a local hospital, but I see it as more than that. When
                the decision is finally made on area hospitals, and specifically
                on Belfast City and the Royal Group, what will be the
                possibilities for local hospitals to facilitate area hospitals
                in the medium-to-long term?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Lagan Valley Hospital is in a unique
                position, being close to the motorway, with easy parking access
                and upgraded ward facilities. It could form a partnership with
                the area hospital by providing, for example, day procedures and
                elective work, thus lightening the load of the area hospitals
                which, in the medium term, will be experiencing a severe
                workload.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the majority of
                accident-and-emergency and midwifery services will be kept in
                the Lagan Valley Hospital, especially given the fact that its
                maternity services were awarded a Charter Mark in 1997. This, of
                course, can only happen with adequate consultancy back-up and, I
                hope, with the expansion of the new telemedicine in the near
                future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of us are very conscious of the need for
                a better Ambulance Service, which is vital to ensure that people
                in all rural areas, including part of Lagan Valley, get as high
                a standard of care as those in the urban areas. It is important
                that the Ambulance Service work in partnership with the local
                hospitals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are just a few of the benefits which
                Lagan Valley Hospital can offer to complement the area hospitals
                and provide a better service for patients in the local and wider
                communities.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome Mr McFall’s visit here today, and
                I want to thank him for taking the health spokesmen of the
                parties into his confidence before he launched this document.
                That is a very welcome trend, and one that I hope will continue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a mythical conveyor belt heading
                towards one Assemblyman, and on that conveyor belt is the
                ultimate poisoned chalice, stamped &quot;Minister of Health and
                Social Services&quot;. Someone in this Chamber will drink from
                that chalice, and I do not envy him or her that predicament. It
                won’t be me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard a lot this afternoon about the
                various colleges. Down District Council, in its response to the
                Minister’s decision — that Minister being
                Mr&nbsp;Worthington — on the future of Downe Hospital, pointed
                out that the colleges do not all agree on this issue. After the
                Minister took that decision, the report of a joint working party
                was published which made interesting reading. The Department
                does not seem to have taken the joint working party’s
                recommendations into account when coming to the decisions
                outlined for Downe in this document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the conclusions in that report was
                that in America 50% of all graduate doctors are being encouraged
                to specialise in general medicine. They think the trend towards
                specialisation has gone too far, and they are hoping to have
                half the qualified doctors performing a general surgical role
                rather than specialising. The report argues that often, and
                particularly with elderly patients, a patient has a wide range
                of complaints. What that person needs is to be treated not by a
                series of specialists, but by someone who has a general training
                and can call upon a specialist if needs be. It is better for a
                person to be taught by someone with a much wider knowledge.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can quote the surgeons, but they do not
                agree. Even if they did agree, this process should not be driven
                entirely by the Royal Colleges. There are many things in life
                which seem to need specialisation or concentration, but that
                takes no account of the needs of the ordinary, individual
                patient. We could concentrate many services in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland on one or two major facilities —
                education is the obvious example. There would be logic behind a
                proposal to concentrate the teaching of a certain language or
                subject in one school in the Province, but that would take no
                account of those who live in rural areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question I ask is one which no one has
                satisfactorily answered: does someone who falls and breaks his
                leg in Main&nbsp;Street, Strangford get the same treatment as
                someone who breaks his leg in Royal&nbsp;Avenue in Belfast? The
                answer must be &quot;No.&quot; The patient in Strangford has to
                be ferried to Downpatrick, but instead of being taken to Downe
                Hospital, under these proposals, he would then have to make the
                30-mile trip to the City or the Royal in Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that the Minister has a
                chauffeur-driven car — I would love to have one myself, but I
                never will; Back-Benchers do not get chauffeur-driven cars —
                but has he ever tried driving from Ardglass or Killough to
                Belfast on a wet Saturday night in November or December? Has he
                ever tried that? Does he see how practical, or otherwise, the
                proposal is that a person who has had a serious accident or a
                heart attack in a rural area should be driven to Belfast?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, traffic in Belfast is now
                utterly horrendous at night, particularly during the rush hour
                between four and six, and in the mornings. Even during the day
                there are long queues. It would be physically impossible for an
                ambulance to get through. And yet, the Minister says in this
                document that he is putting the care in the right place at the
                right time. I simply cannot accept that. If he can convince us,
                in the few short months before he hands over the poisoned
                chalice, that that person will be getting the right treatment in
                the right place at the right time, I will be the first to admit
                that I was wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The community that I represent in South Down
                thinks quite the opposite. The local GPs want acute services
                retained at Downe, and the surgeons want to retain those
                specialties in Downe Hospital. A major selling exercise would
                have to be done before anyone would be convinced that the best
                interests of the people in Down district are not served by the
                retention of the acute services at that hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is recognised in the document that
                accessibility is an important issue, that it is impossible to
                expect somebody from Strabane or Omagh to be ferried to Belfast.
                The same conclusions can be reached when considering Downe
                Hospital because of the rural nature of that part of the
                constituency of South Down. The same criteria should be used
                when considering that hospital.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also like to welcome the Minister
                here today. I welcome the paper and the opportunity to discuss
                the future of the hospitals and acute services. As other Members
                have said, there are hard questions to be answered and major
                decisions to be taken by us all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that services must be cost-effective,
                that they must deliver a high standard of service and that they
                must be able to meet the needs of the whole community. Proposals
                which meet these criteria must, therefore, be identified and put
                in to practice. They need to be radical and far-reaching. While
                any proposals need to be measured against cost, this must not
                become the overriding principle. The health needs of people,
                particularly when it comes to acute services, must always be
                paramount. It is vital that when the Assembly comes to take
                decisions on this question, cost-effectiveness should not take
                precedence in respect of the provision of health services.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that it also states in the document
                that some smaller hospitals will be able to provide more general
                acute services in Coleraine, Newry and the southern part of the
                Western Board. Mr&nbsp;Foster and other Members spoke very
                eloquently about the needs of their constituents. We must look
                again at the list of the golden six hospitals to ensure that the
                right number are providing the right service, in the right
                place, to the right people. When we look at the provision of
                services all these questions will need to be taken into account.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An executive committee must be established
                urgently so that the service which is so badly needed by
                everybody can be provided.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are due to finish at 6&nbsp;o’clock,
                thereby allowing four hours for this debate. Should the House
                wish to proceed with the remainder of the Order Paper, I have
                enough Members — many of whom have been waiting for a very
                long time — to take us two and a half hours beyond 6&nbsp;o’clock.
                I propose, therefore, to remain faithful to the existing

                For the remainder of the time available, Members will be given

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although it will be a matter for the business
                of the House, it seems to me that health issues will require
                substantial attention at an early stage. For now, it is

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a question for the Minister, but he
                has indicated that he is eager to receive Assembly Members’
                representations. If matters have been raised to which he has
                been unable to respond verbally, I believe that he will be
                prepared to reply in writing. With regard to matters not raised
                because Members did not have the opportunity to speak, I feel
                certain that the Minister will try to respond.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too wish to welcome the Minister, but for a
                reason quite different from that of some other Members. I
                represent Craigavon, and I am glad to see that Craigavon
                Hospital has been elevated into a different category.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Earlier, my good friend,
                Rev&nbsp;William&nbsp;McCrea, said that I was sitting here
                smugly. That may be so, but I am very concerned about the
                possibility of hospital closures. I was in Craigavon Hospital a
                few weeks ago as a patient and had to sit for an hour and a
                half.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very concerned about the extra burdens
                that are going to be put on hospital staff, and would like to
                pay tribute to those staff who have been working under difficult
                circumstances and a great deal of stress, not knowing which
                category their hospital is to be slotted into. Staff in these
                hospitals face a huge challenge, because so much is being asked
                of them. We all know that young doctors want to be trained in a
                big catchment area; it may be the same in respect of nurses. We
                must recognise the challenge facing the nurses and provide them
                with an incentive to carry out their work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of months ago, it was brought to my
                attention that there was an advertisement in the local press for
                people to work on bin lorries. Another advertisement which
                appeared was for a trained nurse in a specialised post. It was
                noticeable that the assistants on the bin lorries were being
                paid more than the trained nurses. There is something wrong with
                that; we cannot do without nurses, and they must be given every
                incentive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have watched Craigavon Hospital develop
                over the years into one of the major hospitals in Northern
                Ireland. I sympathise with people whose area hospitals have
                closed over the years. Just 18&nbsp;months ago the Banbridge
                Hospital closed, and that was a big drawback in the Upper Bann
                constituency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People do not like change but change will
                come anyway, so we must face up to it. I am glad that the
                Ambulance Service is going to get a boost — it certainly needs
                it. I hope that money is provided to bring the service up to
                date. One Member mentioned that some ambulances have been is use
                for so long that they are well past their sell-by date. We
                cannot expect ambulance drivers to carry out the work unless
                they have the appropriate equipment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that Craigavon Hospital is safe. I
                also face the challenge — and I speak for quite a number of
                the people in Craigavon Hospital — of dealing with the extra
                burden that is going to be placed on us.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also want to express my appreciation to the
                Minister for the time that he has devoted to the discussion this
                afternoon. He has, during the course of the discussion, heard
                many views from the west of the Province and, as the Member from
                the most westerly part of the North of Ireland, I want to speak
                particularly about provision there. I want to put forward the
                views of the elected representatives in the various councils
                with regard to hospital provision and to express some
                reservations about the document’s references to the Ambulance
                Service and to the need for an improved network for GPs. I am
                not simply moaning about the situation — I am trying to put
                across the very genuine concerns and fears that people living
                there have about the issue of accessibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the west of the Province the population
                density is one quarter of the average for Northern&nbsp;Ireland,
                and the provision of health and hospital services requires very
                careful consideration as the people who live there are scattered
                across a very large area. Unfortunately, this aspect has not
                been considered in the document. The paper is very general and
                assumes, without providing any detailed analysis, that one acute
                hospital based in either Enniskillen or Omagh is capable of
                serving the needs of the people in the south-western area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This assumption was not borne out by a review
                of acute hospital services in the Sperrin Lakeland Trust carried
                out in 1996. The review was commissioned jointly by the trust
                and the three councils in the area — Strabane, Omagh and
                Fermanagh. It explored the options and recommended a strategy
                for hospital provision in the west — namely, that one hospital
                on two sites (Omagh and Enniskillen) was the best basis for the
                development of acute services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This document has ignored that review and the
                combined views of the three councils, Omagh, Fermanagh and
                Strabane, which serve Counties Fermanagh and Tyrone. Instead of
                setting out an appropriate response for delivering important
                medical services to rural areas, it recommends a solution more
                befitting an urban problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the document there is much reference to
                the provision of a modernised and highly effective ambulance
                service. The Minister said today that this service was &quot;the
                key to unlocking the way forward&quot;. The reality is that
                Fermanagh has the worst roads infrastructure in Ireland. The
                main road between Omagh and Enniskillen is in very poor
                condition and deteriorating. It is impossible to achieve
                improvement in ambulance response times.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The paper refers to improvement in the
                service provided by GPs. In April 1998 the GPs in Fermanagh set
                up an out-of-hours co-operative. The centre is in Enniskillen
                and claims to provide a service for the entire county. There are
                grave concerns among the people of Fermanagh about that
                arrangement. Already a number of incidents are under
                investigation. In some cases it can take 45&nbsp;minutes — in
                others it can take longer — to reach a patient in an
                emergency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The paper draws attention to the important
                issues of efficiency, effectiveness, standards, recruitment and
                training, but the primary issue is accessibility. Common sense
                tells us that state-of-the-art services which are not accessible
                when required are useless. In a medical emergency time is all
                important. This is overlooked in the document. We must find a
                solution which addresses the needs of the people in Fermanagh
                and in west and south Tyrone.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister. I have listened to
                submissions by my Colleagues Mr&nbsp;Hutchinson and Mr&nbsp;Boyd
                on Whiteabbey Hospital. What assurances can the Minister give to
                the people of east Antrim, particularly the large rural
                community and those isolated in areas such as Islandmagee,
                Ballycarry and the north of Larne, regarding the standard, in
                the future, of the accident and emergency services? Response
                times are sometimes up to 45 minutes, and there is no minor
                injury unit in Larne.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The area is not without a history of serious
                incidents. My Colleague Mr&nbsp;Dodds and I share these
                concerns, having been involved in a tragic bus crash in the area
                some years ago when five lives were lost. Fortunately,
                Whiteabbey Hospital saved many more lives that evening. Does the
                Minister agree that as four hospitals in our constituency have
                been lost, there is a need to upgrade and improve the accident
                and emergency services and the cardiac unit at our only
                remaining facility? Since we have a strategic position in
                relation to the seaport and the flight paths of both airports,
                any review must take account of those services. Extra miles cost
                lives.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome Mr&nbsp;McFall. In his opening
                remarks in the document he says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;This paper is not a blueprint for
                change. It is an analysis of where we are and a vision of what

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suggest that any proposals for change in
                the Health Service are checked against equality issues, and that
                there must be an appraisal to ensure that they do not limit
                access or discriminate against a section of the community on the
                basis of location and membership of disadvantaged groups. I
                recommend that a policy appraisal and fair treatment exercise be
                conducted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask Mr&nbsp;McFall to tell us how bad the
                crisis in the Department of Health and Social Services is.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.30 pm</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms E Bell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall be brief, as I am sure the Minister
                is suffering from speech fatigue. The Minister has listened to
                concerns in respect of every part of the Province. I commend him
                for Bangor Community Hospital. As a member of the council’s
                health committee, I had experience of the old hospital, which
                should not have been closed, and of the new hospital which is
                now in a beautiful centre and which I hope will continue to
                expand and develop.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document reads more like an impossible
                dream than a realistic vision. If the Minister’s strategic
                vision that patients receive the right treatment at the right
                place from the right person is to be realised, we will need a
                lot of resources. Those resources must be guaranteed if we are
                to implement the proposals in the document and provide a health
                service for all of the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document is a good base for good practice
                needs. However, successive Governments have found it impossible
                to address some of the problems in the Health Service, most of
                which have been caused by lack of resources. Health Service
                staff are very good, and proper tribute has been paid to them.
                However, resources are needed to put matters right, and the
                Minister will have to help us with money.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFall:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Mr&nbsp;Wells would like a
                chauffeur-driven car he can have mine. I come with gifts at
                Christmas and they are refused.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Assembly for the manner in which
                the debate has been conducted. I am indebted to Members for
                their constructive approach, and I am privileged to be
                discussing this issue with them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After only one week in this job I was on duty
                in Omagh, and was privileged to witness the heroic work
                following the bomb there. What struck me was the fact that the
                whole of the National Health Service is greater than the sum of
                its parts. That led me to look at the Health Service in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland as a whole — not disparately. Community
                and local issues are important, but it is also important to look
                at the whole picture. When I discovered that it had been
                40&nbsp;years since the last comprehensive review of the Health
                Service, I resolved to publish this document so that the debate
                could take place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People think that hospital services in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland are fine, but they are not. I was asked
                about the developing crisis in the Health Service, which has
                been allayed by good work at local level. However, if the trend
                continues people will have a second-class service, and that
                cannot be tolerated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document has been generally accepted
                although in some cases parochialism was evident. The document
                challenges people by saying that a strategic view is needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I will respond to Mr&nbsp;Foster’s
                comments about the golden six. This is a very unfortunate term
                that has been allowed to enter the lexicon of politics in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, and I do not know where it came from.
                What we should be talking about, rather than a golden six, is a
                golden network, an entire network that makes appropriate
                provision for the Health Service. That is why I have fashioned
                this document to incorporate the new care networks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There should be four levels of care in a
                modern NHS. First, there is the primary care level, and why so?
                This is because over 90% of all consultations take place at
                primary care level. People go to GPs, nurses and community
                practitioners, and the service is provided there. Now, sensible
                policy dictates that if the resources are there, the money must
                also be targeted there, so that has to change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr&nbsp;McDonnell asked whether this was a
                health service or a disease service. It is a health service, and
                we need to make sure that we have preventative health provision
                at community level, and community care teams are extremely
                important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the local hospitals should be the
                cornerstones, and ten local hospitals have been suggested. Some
                have asked whether they are just going to be super clinics with
                GPs in attendance. The present models in Ards and Bangor, where
                GPs have developed their resources, should be looked at. I went
                to visit one of the GPs in charge, Dr&nbsp;Ian&nbsp;Clements,
                and asked him how long it takes people to start thinking about
                change and to get it going? He said that there had to be
                elements of remuneration and that aspects such as clinical
                development had to be taken care of, but that it took five or
                six years. Then I asked if he would change it, and he said
                absolutely not, because they had a service that provided
                patients with a local accident unit which did not abuse
                accident-and-emergency provisions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People ask why I am thinking of change when
                we have accident-and-emergency services now and people can go
                and queue for four hours at a hospital. The reason is that three
                out of every four people who attend accident-and-emergency units
                should not be there — they go with minor injuries. There is a
                statutory requirement in accident-and-emergency units for people
                to be seen; that is why there are four-hour queues. Resources
                are not properly used in our accident-and-emergency services.
                That is the issue at stake here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr&nbsp;Hendron mentioned the need to
                establish a Shadow Executive. I am not going into the politics
                now; I am remaining with health. However, I say to Members today
                that I am willing to ensure that we have dialogue with the
                Assembly health spokespersons so that, when the Assembly is
                established, Members will have the information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not here for the next few months to
                hoard information and then to hand it out in dribs and drabs. I
                want to engage with the Assembly fully on this so that Members
                will be able to take those decisions from a very early stage —
                that offer is open. I hope that, along with both the First and
                the Deputy First Ministers (Designate), we can explore ideas,
                but the Assembly can come back to me any time on that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will quickly address the matter raised by
                Dr&nbsp;Hendron about the Mater Hospital. The trustees have
                plans to replace the existing ward accommodation using trust
                funds, and no commitment to using public funds has been given.
                However, a fully worked out business case will be required if
                public funds are sought, and decisions on the business case will
                reflect the strategic agenda and be influenced by the outcome of
                a review undertaken by the Eastern Health Board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I mentioned primary care, and I described the
                10&nbsp;local hospitals as being the corner stone. One important
                aspect of this is that the local hospital, the area hospital and
                the two regional hospitals will form a network.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Royal College has stated that acute
                services should be based on a population of 450,000. My own
                constituency has moved to that figure. It is not easy. When
                people are well they want to have a hospital near them, but when
                they are ill they want to have the best service and will travel
                to get it. Surveys in Northern Ireland have reflected this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not possible for Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                to have three acute hospitals because of its geography and its
                rural element. So I have suggested four area hospitals, with
                three others being enhanced. Those will be allied to the two
                regional hospitals which at the moment are performing cleft
                palate, and cochlear implant operations that would not normally
                be provided for a population of one and a half million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am suggesting that there is interlinking
                between the hospitals and centralisation, but there is also
                decentralisation. We can see that with the Campbell Report on
                cancer care where operations are being decentralised to the
                local level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Gibson mentioned the 40-year-old
                patient in Muckamore Abbey. I have a letter copied from
                Mrs&nbsp;Hilary&nbsp;Smith, and I will certainly get back to him
                on that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Molloy said that in the past people
                have been told about what they were losing, not about what they
                were getting. I would like to consider this document as an audit
                — the books are open. Members will have to decide for
                themselves. Members can challenge it if they wish, and it is
                there to be challenged, but I believe that Members will find it
                very difficult to challenge its analysis. But if Members decide
                differently, I will be quite happy to look at it again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Molloy also asked about the provision
                for clinical governance at the moment. Quality is the major
                priority, and clinical governance is there to ensure that the
                proper processes and systems are in place at each hospital,
                those that will ensure that the best quality of care is
                delivered. No matter where one lives in Northern Ireland, one
                can be assured of the same level of service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Close focused solely on the Lagan
                Valley Hospital. He mentioned that he had fought the Tories and
                that he was going to fight others. Well, best wishes to him,
                because he will shortly have to fight with his fellow Assembly
                Members. But that will be for him to decide.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as I know, Lagan Valley is about
                20&nbsp;minutes from Belfast by road. I was reading my ‘West
                Highland Free Press’ at the weekend, and in it was a plea from
                a GP on the Isle of Skye. He said that there was going to be a
                consultancy and that the area’s constituents would have to
                travel for three hours. So Northern&nbsp;Ireland is doing quite
                well, particularly the Lagan Valley Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maternity services were mentioned, and I have
                a personal tale to tell. I do not want to see any child born in
                a maternity unit which does not have back-up paediatrics and
                anesthetists. My wife and I lost our second child, who was
                still-born, and my wife was taken into hospital early with our
                fifth child because she had placenta previa. Notwithstanding
                that, on the day of the birth she took a haemorrhage and had to
                be taken to the emergency operating theatre. The doctors had
                predicted that everything would be okay but that proved not to
                be the case. Nobody can predict with absolute certainty that
                everything will be okay, and that is why we need back-up
                paediatrics and anesthetists. I see that as being extremely
                important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maternity services have been getting on well
                because of the dedication of the staff, as Donaldson said in his
                review. We should not impose these problems on staff; and change
                is needed in these areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not accept Assemblyman&nbsp;Boyd’s
                assertion that &quot;centres of excellence&quot; is just a fancy
                name for cost-cutting. He asked me not to take any decisions
                until Members can decide for themselves. I have to say, clearly
                and unambiguously, that I will not give a positive response to
                that. Very serious issues are frequently landing on my desk, so
                I am going to discharge my responsibility as a Minister with the
                integrity that the post demands. I will try to preserve quality
                and safety in the Health Service in Northern&nbsp;Ireland but I
                look forward to the Assembly taking up these particular issues.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams encapsulated Members’
                feelings when she said that they wanted something done, but not
                in their area. She mentioned community care. In the allocations
                announced today we have given £25&nbsp;million to community
                care. At a dinner several months ago the directors of community
                care said to me that their area was the Cinderella of the Health
                Service and that the Government should focus attention on it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Government is about priorities. If we focus
                too much on hospitals, then we let down community care. There
                are priorities and balances to be maintained. Ms&nbsp;McWilliams
                got it right when she citied her sister’s crash two years ago.
                She said that her sister got the best service in the regional
                hospital, the Royal Victoria Hospital, where the orthopaedic
                services were available. That was also the case in Omagh. Triage
                was carried out after the bombing, and people were sent to the
                best places for their injuries — to Altnagelvin for limbs or
                to the Royal Victoria Hospital for neurosurgery, or whatever. We
                can provide at a local level, but when expert service is
                required, the Government must ensure that an appropriate network
                exists. That is extremely important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assemblyman McGimpsey asked why the Jubilee
                maternity unit is to be closed. This decision is the subject of
                an application to judicial review, and it would be inappropriate
                for me to comment on it at this time. However, I will look at
                this matter with my officials and forward a reply.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assemblyman&nbsp;McGrady and I have been
                discussing Downe Hospital since the day I came to
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. I remember being in my car the first day
                I was here, and the mobile phone rang. It was the ‘Down
                Recorder’, and ever since then I have had an affiliation with
                Assemblyman&nbsp;Wells and Assemblyman McGrady. There is an
                urgent need to replace the existing Downe Hospital, and I think
                that we would agree on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have set a challenging timetable for the
                production of a new business case for the hospital. It has to be
                produced by March and once this is approved I want the project
                to go ahead as quickly as possible. The necessary funding will
                be found from the overall comprehensive spending review
                settlement that I announced today. I welcome the support for a
                quick completion of the business case shown by Assemblyman&nbsp;McGrady
                last week in his comments to the press.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assemblyman Shannon mentioned the possibility
                of outstations at Ballywater and Kircubbin. I will look at this
                issue with my officials to see exactly what can be done in that
                area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assemblyman McGuinness said that the debate
                on the Health Service has been driven by the Government, by the
                Royal Colleges and by the boards. I want the debate to be
                influenced by the community, hence the ‘Putting it Right’
                paper. It is available for debate, it is available for
                consultation, and it is available to ensure that the Government
                listen to everyone’s voice. There has possibly been benign
                neglect over 40&nbsp;years, but there is urgency to this matter
                now. Assemblyman McGuinness said that there is something wrong
                when 20,000 to 30,000&nbsp;people turn out to demonstrate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, there is something wrong; there is a
                legacy of neglect. I do not want people to be frightened and
                anxious. It is therefore incumbent upon all of us to ensure that
                we do have a strategy. Not everyone is going to like it, but it
                is very important to have a strategy.
                Assemblyman&nbsp;Hutchinson made a good comment recently:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I think the Assembly is going to have
                to take hard decisions. I hope that people are not parochial
                about this and start fighting their own corner. We are all
                elected by different constituencies and, of course, when we get
                to hell, it is a question of leadership.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a question of leadership for all of us
                — for me as much as for anybody else. It would have been
                better for me not to tackle this issue over the last few months,
                not to wander into areas of political controversy and not to
                have Assemblyman&nbsp;Haughey and others phoning the radio about
                me, but that would have been a dereliction of duty. It is very
                important that leadership is shown by yourselves and by me so
                that we work together to ensure that when March comes, we are
                doing something about the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assemblyman&nbsp;Haughey mentioned the west
                of the Bann, an important aspect of which I was acutely aware. I
                have set up an ambulance review, and that is going to report
                next year. However, I was not content with just a review,
                because I had heard time and time again about the various
                problems, and that is why the document’s only explicit
                commitment is for £15&nbsp;million for the Ambulance Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People ask what is the use of the extra money
                for the Ambulance Service. It is very valuable and everybody has
                recognised that today. Northern Ireland shares with Scotland a
                high rate of coronary heart disease as a consequence of bad diet
                and unhealthy living. People have heart attacks in different
                parts of the country. If we get a good Ambulance Service, it
                will ensure that we get ambulances to the places where people
                are ill. We have quick response times, and we are trying to
                improve those times. Any medic will tell you that in a critical
                situation, the time after the attack is extremely important: the
                time when one attempts to stabilise the condition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I envisage an ambulance system with improved
                technology and communications and with trained paramedics linked
                up by cellular telephone to consultant cardiologists so that
                expert advice can be given at the site of an incident. A person
                could be stabilised there and then and taken to hospital. This
                is my vision for the Ambulance Service, and it is crucial that
                we work together on it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assemblyman&nbsp;Haughey sees a
                conspiratorial element in the closure of the South Tyrone
                Hospital. Mr&nbsp;Ken&nbsp;Maginnis, the MP for the area, took
                the same conspiratorial approach to me in a debate last week in
                Parliament. I will be very clear on the matter. I am not going
                to go back on anything that the doctors, the anaesthetists or
                the consultants at the South Tyrone have said. As John&nbsp;McFall,
                as Minister for Health, as a politician and a non-medic, I am
                not going to second-guess doctors when they talk to me about the
                safety of the service. I am very clear on that, and I will not
                go back on it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assemblyman&nbsp;McCrea talks of people being
                smug. Nobody is being smug here today on any issue. He spoke
                about the quality of services and the quality of the
                accessibility, and I am 100% with him on that. It is said that I
                am making it comfortable for the Royal Colleges — people have
                made this point to me about the Royal Colleges. It is said that
                the Royal Colleges have the best closed shop in the land, the
                best trade union you can get and that everything is being done
                at their dictate. I do not accept any of this. We have to work
                alongside the Royal Colleges to establish the best training for
                doctors and the best quality of care. We have to take them in to
                our confidence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been impressed with the comments that
                I have received from the Royal Colleges over the past few
                months, and I hope that the Assembly will work with the Royal
                Colleges to ensure that Northern&nbsp;Ireland gets adequate
                treatment. We have had horrendous cases in the United Kingdom,
                such as in Bristol, and we must ensure that the best training
                and quality are provided.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs&nbsp;Nelis mentioned trust chief
                executives’ pay. I agree entirely on that point. I am not
                opposed to people being properly remunerated for their services,
                but in recent years chief executives’ pay has become distorted
                in relation to the pay of other Health Service staff.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have written to the chief executives of
                trusts and boards asking for a breakdown of senior executives’
                pay so that I can examine the issue and ensure that it remains
                within the stated guidelines. I am hoping to prepare a paper for
                the Assembly so that, if required, primary legislation can be
                introduced on the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assemblyman&nbsp;R&nbsp;Hutchinson talked
                about East Antrim and asked me to check about two new ambulances
                in Larne. I will do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assemblyman&nbsp;McDonnell asked whether it
                was a disease service or a health service. The Government have
                produced a White Paper on smoking. He was somewhat conservative
                in his estimates — around 3,000&nbsp;people in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland die each year from lung cancer. It is
                important to have a healthy-living strategy — a social agenda
                for health — and that can tie in with Government’s primary
                care vision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assemblyman&nbsp;Morrow mentioned an
                Information Technology structure. Telemedicine is the answer.
                Go, as I have done, to Ards or Bangor Hospitals and see the link
                up. I had a link up with a consultant in the Royal, but it could
                just as easily have been a consultant in Aberdeen or London. The
                examination takes place, information technology is used to best
                advantage — and this is important — the patient is treated
                at local level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assemblyman&nbsp;Wells mentioned, in almost
                biblical terms, the challenge to the new Health Minister. Maybe
                I will hold a competition for that, and the Assembly could work
                on it with me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assemblyman&nbsp;Gallagher mentioned
                accessibility in the west of the Province. That is at the core
                of this document, and I am happy to work with Members on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, this vision is perhaps 30&nbsp;years
                too late, but the Health Service needs to be tackled radically
                now — the status quo is not an option. With the status quo, an
                extra 120&nbsp;consultants would need to be recruited. Fourteen
                per year are being trained, so it cannot be done. But even if it
                could, it would result in overstaffing, a loss of skills and the
                underutilisation of equipment. That is no recipe for a modern
                health service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A modern health service should provide people
                with a service at the right level; we do not have that at
                present. According to the Royal Colleges, only four hospitals
                out of 17 satisfy surgical requirements, and on accident and
                emergency only six out of 17 satisfy those requirements. That is
                not good enough — change is needed.</p>
