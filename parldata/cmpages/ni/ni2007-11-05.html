	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr  Molloy] in the Chair).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. On 15 October 2007, the Assembly  debated a motion concerning the process for the creation of a bill of rights  for Northern Ireland.  During that debate, a DUP Member made a contribution during which she named at  least 12 individuals. At the time, I raised a point of order with the Deputy  Speaker to seek a ruling as to whether it was in order for those comments to be  made. The Deputy Speaker said that that was in order because Assembly Members  enjoy limited privilege.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask that that matter be given further consideration. In  my view, and in the view of many people and organisations in the human-rights  community, it was not in order for those comments to be made, and it is a  breach of the limited privilege that Members enjoy to make such comments in  respect of people who have no opportunity to reply. Mr Deputy Speaker, I urge  you and your colleagues to consider this matter further.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The issues of the authority and protection of the House in respect  of defamation have been raised with the Speaker, who has received  correspondence on this matter. The Speaker will make a further statement at a  later date.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: Further to that point of order, is it in order for the Speaker to  be called on to return to a matter on which he has already decided?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is a separate issue, Dr Paisley. The Speaker will return to  the matter because of the correspondence that he has received from a number of  different quarters. The Speaker will make a further statement.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">October Monitoring Outcome</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of Finance and Personnel  that he wishes to make a statement on public expenditure in 2007-08 following  the October monitoring round.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">Robinson)</span></strong>: With permission, I wish to make a statement  on behalf of the Executive on public spending in 2007-08, following the  conclusion of the October monitoring round. As Members will be aware, the  monitoring process exists to help the Executive to make the most of the  resources at their disposal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A key element of that is the identification, by <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">Departments, of resources allocated in previous  budg</span><span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">ets</span>, which, for a variety  of reasons, will not be spent in this financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The normal approach in the monitoring process is to  reallocate such sums to pressure points identified by Departments. It is not  surprising that such flexibility and pressures emerge during the course of a  financial year, in view of the fact that budgets are determined a considerable  period in advance of the actual spend being incurred, and when a range of  forecasts and assumptions have underpinned  the position. In addition, unforeseen issues emerge; for instance, the  recent incidents of flooding, which, I am sure that Members will agree, could  not have been anticipated by those setting budgets for the current financial  year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my view, this  approach to in-year monitoring is the sensible  and pragmatic way to deal with the uncertainty that is inherent when  setting budgets. However, as Members will be aware, following my statement on  the June monitoring round, our position in this financial year is different  given that we have inherited it from our direct rule predecessors.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The key issue is that the direct rule team adopted an  aggressive approach to overcommitting budgets, which meant that allocations in the budget process were higher than  would otherwise have been the case. However, the corollary of that is a  significant reduction in the <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">level of  in-year flexibility, and, as Members will be a</span><span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">w</span>are, the Executive were unable to make any additional  allocations to Departments in the June monitoring round, notwithstanding that  Departments had identified around &pound;11 million in reduced requirements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have to report to the Assembly that that inherited overcommitment position pervades the in-year  financial position. However, as a consequence of the steps that we took  in the June monitoring round, and through our ongoing work with Departments,  the Executive are in a position to make some reallocations to Departments. I  will say a little more about those shortly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Reduced requirements declared by Departments in this  monitoring round amount to &pound;60&middot;2 million for current expenditure and &pound;42&middot;6  million for capital investment. This level of reduced expenditure by  Departments is in keeping with the levels that would be expected at this time  of the year, and will go some way towards reversing the relatively low levels  declared by Departments in the June monitoring round.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many of the reduced requirements declared by Departments  have arisen through a combination of a service, or function, requiring less  than its existing provision, changing price assumptions, or from delays in  implementing policies. However, the most notable of the reduced requirements  are the &pound;14&middot;5 million of capital previously  set aside as funding for the integrated development fund, against which  no further projects have been identified, and the &pound;15&middot;1 million of current  expenditure, which was allocated originally to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) in the  current financial year in relation to a planned Government intervention to  reduce electricity costs for businesses. That application was withdrawn because  of difficulties encountered with the  European Commission around the original proposal&rsquo;s state-aid  implications.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A &pound;14&middot;5 million current expenditure easement on the second  major roads PFI scheme has arisen because of a change in accounting treatment. Details of all the reduced  requirements declared by Departments are set out in table 1 of my statement, which is available to Members.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Against those declarations, Departments have submitted  current expenditure bids amounting to &pound;92&middot;2 million and capital investment bids  amounting to &pound;171&middot;6 million. Focusing on current expenditure, despite more than  &pound;60 million of reduced requirements being declared by Departments, my analysis  is that, given the ongoing need to manage the inherited overcommitment  position, there is scope for only &pound;23 million of allocations to Departments.  For capital expenditure, the position is different, in that in addition to the  &pound;42&middot;6 million reduced requirements identified by Departments, there has been a  range of issues where early slippage identified by Departments has resulted in  further scope for allocations at this time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In total, there is capacity to make additional capital  allocations of &pound;71&middot;3 million. Details of the additional allocations agreed by  the Executive are set out in table 2 to my statement, which is available to  Members. I do not propose to explain each item in detail. However, I shall  outline some of the more significant items.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For current expenditure and capital investment, the largest  allocations are to the Department for Regional Development (DRD)for water and  sewerage services. Additional amounts have been allocated for current  expenditure and capital investment of &pound;11&middot;7 million and &pound;32 million  respectively. Those amounts are to meet the agreed costs of Northern Ireland  Water, which were unable to be funded in previous budget-setting exercises. That additional allocation high&shy;lights  the ongoing strain that the funding of water and sewerage services from public  expenditure causes for other Government services. Had those services been fully  self-financed at this time, those amounts would have been available to the  Executive for reinvestment in front-line public services to meet the needs of  the community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Other current expenditure allocations amount to: some &pound;2&middot;8 million to the Department of Education  (DE) to underpin the issue of home-to-school transport; and &pound;1&middot;5 million  to the Department of the Environment (DOE) in respect of the Executive&rsquo;s  response to the recent flooding. That money will be paid in the form of relief  to district councils. Other notable current expenditure items relate to internal  costs: &pound;2&middot;3 million to the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) for the additional costs associated  with the restoration of devolution; and &pound;3&middot;2 million to the Department of  Finance and Personnel (DFP) for the costs associated with the ongoing extensive  Civil Service-wide reform programme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have agreed an additional capital investment  allocation of some &pound;20&middot;4 million to the Department  for Social Development for social housing. That allocation underpins the  comments that I made when I launched the draft Budget about the importance of that issue and the need to find sufficient  funds, where available, for that  necessary and important public service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Other significant capital allocations are: &pound;10&middot;7 million to  the Department of Finance and Personnel, which  is linked to the Civil Service reform programme; and &pound;8 million to the  Department for Regional Development for the purchase of land in connection with  two separate road schemes. Although that land is not needed for immediate use,  the opportunity has now arisen to purchase it. Given the ongoing significant  inflation associated with the purchase of land, the Executive have concluded  that it makes sense to make use of this opportunity and purchase the land at  this time rather than at a future time when the land may have been developed  and exposed to a further period of significant inflationary growth and,  therefore, a higher cost to the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There will be a further opportunity to review the in-year  position in December. That may provide further scope to consider any remaining  pressures that Departments still face. However, I stress that that is subject  to all Departments undertaking a thorough review of their in-year requirements,  with the early identification of all slippages or potential underspends for  current expenditure and capital investment. This necessary and fundamental  requirement of the in-year monitoring process will allow us to make the best  use of the resources at our disposal and maximise the level of spend on public  services in a time of constrained public expenditure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I highlight the difficulties that the inherited  overcommitment position is causing us. However, in looking to the future, I  highlight the position set out in my recent  draft Budget statement, where I have initiated a phased reduction of the overcommitment position over the next  three years. I am confident that that position, aligned with our ongoing work to improve the level and quality of financial management across all Departments,  will pay dividends in better departmental financial performances at all levels.  I commend the October monitoring position to the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McLaughlin)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his statement; it  demonstrates the ongoing process whereby the Assembly is inserting itself more  and more in relation to the management of its available resources. I commend  the statement as very clear evidence of that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In his statement on the June monitoring round, the Minister  expressed concern that only &pound;11 million had been declared in reduced  requirements at that time, against a previous pattern of much higher figures &mdash;  of the order of &pound;30 million or &pound;40 million. At that time, the Minister  emphasised the need for Departments to declare all reductions in September.  Subsequently, the September monitoring round  was delayed. Is the Minister now content that all available reduced  requirements have been declared?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In that same statement in June, the Minister said that last  year&rsquo;s underspend on priority funding packages would be reallocated this time.  Will the Minister comment further on that reallocation?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  We did put off making any announcements in  June because there were not sufficient funds to allocate and because of  the overcommitments with which we were  faced. We also put off the September monitoring round for those reasons,  to allow more funds to accumulate. The Member asks specifically whether I am content that all Departments have  declared all underspends &mdash; the honest answer is that I am not. I believe  that there is still more money to be declared, and the fact that we will come  round in December to more money&rsquo;s being declared indicates that there is a  tendency within Departments to leave it as late as possible, in case they might  be able to spend those resources. However,  from the point of view of &ldquo;Northern Ireland plc&rdquo;, the earlier those  declarations are made, the better and more valuable the spend can be.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is an important point, and the Chairman of the Finance  and Personnel Committee can be very helpful. His Committee will have a role in  looking not just at the amounts declared in-year, but also the out-turn in May,  and will be able to judge how carefully each Department has been monitoring its  spend and ask the necessary questions of those Departments &mdash; including DFP &mdash; if  there is any significant underspend at the end of the year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also asked about the programme funds. Obviously,  I can only reallocate money when Departments announce that they are not using  it. There are two such elements in the reduced requirements: &pound;1&middot;4 million from  the centre in respect of unallocated science and skills money, and reduced  skills and science funding under DETI. Some Departments, therefore, have  offered up money from the Executive programme funds. I suspect that there may  be more in the December or later monitoring rounds.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Minister for making this statement. Given that this monitoring round  would usually have occurred in September, can the Minister advise Members of  the timescale for the two remaining monitoring rounds? In particular, when will  we have a more accurate picture of the potential underspend of the Departments  and the likely requirements for end-year flexibility?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Also, given that the Minister&rsquo;s room for manoeuvre has clearly been limited by the level of overcommitment  set by the direct rule Administration, can he give us some indication of what  level of overcommitment he is planning for over the next three years?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I did put off the September monitoring round until October, but I am planning  that the two further monitoring rounds in the financial year should take place  at their normal times &mdash; December and February. I hope that Departments will  look seriously at their expenditure and offer up any funds that they do not believe can be used within the  financial year. Again, that is a point that was raised by the Chairman  of the Finance and Personnel Committee.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Storey also referred to end-year flexibility. I assume  that he means automatic end-year flexibility for Departments, as was previously  the case. I must point out that end-year  flexibility is no longer automatic; we  have to bid for end-year flexibility with the Treasury. Therefore,  Departments should not assume that there will be automatic end-year  flexibility, which will require more and better planning by each Department in  that area of activity. As Members will know, in the draft Budget, I used  end-year flexibility because there was an agreement with the Treasury, and that  is already underpinning spend within the financial year. It is important that  Departments do not rely on end-year flexibility, except in some very special  circumstances in which it has to be so. End-year flexibility is no longer  automatic.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will be aware that the direct rule Administration left us with an overcommitment of  &pound;160 million in the year, which I thought was excessively high. In the  three-year draft Budget, I sought to taper off that level of overcommitment. It  will be reduced to &pound;100 million in the first financial year, &pound;80 million in the  second and &pound;60 million in the third. Members will see that under the draft  Budget plan, there will a considerable reduction. It is necessary to do it in  that way because Departments will have in-year pressures that cannot be  predicted.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If there is not that degree of flexibility in the funding  arrangements, we would be in trouble if there were a pandemic, for example, and  we did not have the funds to give to the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety (DHSSPS) to deal with it. The flooding was another instance  where we were able to free up money. It is an important part of the fiscal  process that there is that flexibility, and that is why it is being reduced in the way that I have suggested.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The monitoring statement shows no significant new money. I see that the figure  for the Chancellor&rsquo;s Budget for 2007 is  -&pound;0&middot;6 million. Is that further admission by the Minister of Finance and  Personnel of his failure to receive any significant funding package, in  particular, the &pound;1 billion package that was promised?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Member seems to have a fixation on that issue &mdash; he talks of nothing else. Given  that he talks about it as often as he does, one would expect him to get his facts right. If he wants to compare the  package that was negotiated at St Andrews, he  needs something to compare it with. The trouble is that the Ulster Unionist  Party got nothing by way of a package to compare it with. The outcome of this  package was a very significant change in the way that the reinvestment and reform initiative was handled, which  allowed us in the draft Budget to be able to propose  a freeze on the regional rate, whereas his party&rsquo;s proposals would have  resulted in a 19% increase in the regional rate. The public will have a  different view of the benefit of the package, which allowed us to use &pound;70  million to stave off the cost of water charging in this financial year. Another  &pound;30 million will be used for innovation funding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will also be aware that we have succeeded not  only in getting the end-year flexibility allowances that were made by the  Chancellor, but in securing a substantial increase in those end-year  flexibility figures to allow us to use it, front-loaded, for the next financial  year. On top of that, we now have access to asset sales. In the draft Budget, I  was able to identify over &pound;1 billion of asset sales that we will benefit from  directly as part of that package. I could go on, but I do not want to further  embarrass the Member.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his substantial statement. We probably all share rather  contradictory points of view about that issue. On balance, we prefer that  programmes operate as planned and that there does not have to be a release of  funds. However, a release of funds gives flexibility to reallocations, and that  is welcome.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that all sides  of the House will welcome the social  housing allocation of &pound;20&middot;4 million. Furthermore, I welcome the &pound;10&middot;7  million for reform of the Civil Service. Perhaps that will not attract as much  public attention; however, it is a spend-to-save issue, since the benefits to  the public, with regard to the quality of service of Government and the  eventual gains in efficiency, are substantial.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In light of his earlier comments that end-year flexibility  is by no means automatic, can the Minister give  the Members confidence that the capital reallocation of &pound;71&middot;3 million at  this stage of the year will be spent in the current financial year?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: In an ideal world, we could operate as planned; however, there  is no such thing as an ideal world. Programmes will always run late; legal  issues will arise, causing problems and delays; and pressure will be applied to  the Executive to find funds that are not  otherwise available. In-year monitoring is, therefore, required. It is  not new money; it is a reallocation of resources, but in a way that ensures  that the Executive use up all of their money. As the Member said, there is no  automatic ability to carry money forward to the next financial year; it goes  back to the clutches of the Treasury, and is released according to Treasury &mdash;  not Assembly &mdash; programmes. It is, therefore, important that we get as close as  possible to spending all our resource and capital in the financial year and in  the best possible way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Member&rsquo;s comments on the funding allocated to  housing, which should allow the building of approximately 200 new homes. I  suspect that if he were to ask his colleague the Minister for Social  Development the question that he asked me, she would say that she would make a  very good fist of spending all the &pound;20 million on housing in the financial  year. He is. however, right &mdash; money not spent becomes an underspend under  end-year flexibility, and we then have to bid to get our own money back. Far  better that we spend it initially. I hope, therefore, that all the Committees  will examine the funding available to their Departments, and try their best to  ensure that Depart&shy;ments use that funding within the set time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. In his first answer to Mr McLaughlin&rsquo;s  question, he expressed some doubt as to whether all underspends had been  declared. The capital figures show that the only two significant departmental  sums relate to DETI and the Department for Social Development (DSD). DSD&rsquo;s  figure concerns house sales, and I am sure that all of us welcome the fact that  three times as much money has been put back into social housing as has been  released from house sales.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, in general, it is clear that the capital sums are  different from the out-turn at the end of the last financial year, when there  were significant capital underspends in some Departments. That has been the  historic position over several years. Could the Minister, therefore, give us an  assurance that he will ensure that the projected rounds in December and  afterwards will be rather more accurate than, perhaps, are the figures today?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: I welcome Mr Ford&rsquo;s comments; we are on the same page about  the matter. I can reallocate money only as it is given up by Departments.  Having benefited considerably, as a one-time  spending Minister, from the largesse of the leader of the SDLP in that  respect, I know that spending Departments hold on to money for as long as they can. No Department wants to give up  its allocation of money until there is absolute certainty that it cannot be  spent &mdash; that is a natural human instinct. Departments must appraise more  realistically what they can do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is correct; the significant sums left unspent at the end of a financial year could be  allocated to functions for which Ministers are crying out for resources.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we allocate those funds, and it is the  Committees&rsquo; job to do so. I will allocate from my end by continuing to pressure  Ministers; however, Committees also have a role to play in that they will want  to ensure that the money that is allocated to their Departments is spent by  those Departments in the period in which it was given.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, allocation  is a job for the whole Assembly and not simply for the Finance Minister.  Essentially, however, each Minister will make the final decisions for his or  her Department. There must be an honest appraisal of the funds, particularly as  we near the December monitoring round &mdash; even the February monitoring round makes it difficult to spend that  money if it is reallocated. December is the last occasion on which a  reasonable stab can be made at allocating money, particularly for capital  expenditure, and on which Departments can be expected to use it usefully. I  therefore hope that each Department and, indeed, each Committee, takes on board  the Member&rsquo;s message.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Like other Members, I welcome the statement. Has an assessment been made of the  likely amount that will be made available in the December monitoring round?  Does the Minister have any views about what the level of overcommitment should  be following that allocation?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Taking the Member&rsquo;s second question first, at the beginning of the financial  year, the overcommitment was &pound;160 million. Using my best judgement, I have deemed that the &pound;90 million  overspend at this point is sufficient for us to be able to allocate some  funds to deal with the pressures that various Departments face, while being  able to make up the remaining &pound;90 million over the two further monitoring rounds. It would be normal for approximately &pound;50  million to &pound;70 million to have been given up in December. However, there  is no guarantee that that is always the case &mdash; I base that judgement on past  experiences. I suspect that we might want to hold back &pound;20 million or &pound;30 million of those funds to reduce further the  overspend at that period. Who knows? I do not want the figures to be  quoted back to me in December, but perhaps Departments will identify &pound;50  million to &pound;70 million and perhaps around &pound;30 million will be allocated.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  I too thank the Minister for his statement. The Committee for Finance  and Personnel was briefed on DFP&rsquo;s planned submission to the October monitoring  round. Will the Minister comment on the outcome of DFP&rsquo;s bids and how that will affect his own Department&rsquo;s  priorities?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Members will see from the two tables that were attached to the statement that  the DFP bids relate to the reform programme. Those are not unique to DFP; they  cover the entire Civil Service. Therefore, each Department will benefit. DFP  did not have all its bids met, but no Department ever does. It is an important  element of the Executive&rsquo;s programme to proceed with reform in the Civil  Service. It is therefore vital that we meet those bids that in turn, will help  each Department to meet the reform programme and to secure greater efficiency  in the Civil Service.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Although sizeable reduced requirements have been identified, an overcommitment  obviously remains. Will the Minister explain to the House why the new level of  about &pound;90 million that he has revealed from the October monitoring round is  deemed appropriate at this stage in the financial year?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before I call the Minister to respond, I remind Members to switch  off their mobile phones. Someone has their phone switched on, and it is causing  interference with the sound.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: At the end of the day, this is a matter of judgement, and my  view-which the Executive endorsed-was that &pound;90 million was a sufficient amount  at this time. The only basis upon which the judgement was made was past  experience. Certain amounts had been offered in the December and February  monitoring rounds, and if we keep to the averages of those rounds in this  financial year, we should be able to pull back that &pound;90 million.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, we could have used the additional &pound;23 million to  reduce further the degree of over&shy;commitment.  However, Departments were experiencing serious pressures, so, in the  knowledge that we could deal with the overcommitment position in the final two  monitoring rounds, we felt it necessary to relieve some of those pressures.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Given that there is concern in many quarters about the overall cost of  government to the Northern Ireland taxpayer, can the Minister provide a more  detailed breakdown of the additional &pound;2&middot;3 million that was awarded to OFMDFM  for costs associated with the restoration of devolution? Can he confirm whether  additional staff will be employed in that Department as a result of its  receiving that additional money?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I am glad that OFMDFM has been able to hold its staffing level or reduce it  from the level that was experienced under  the previous Executive. Staffing levels must be taken very seriously,  not only in OFMDFM but in every Department. OFMDFM&rsquo;s considerable functions go  beyond the functions of its ministerial private office; for example, it is  responsible for economic policy and equality. Therefore, OFMDFM must carry out  functions over and above those that it carries out on behalf of the Executive  as a whole, the principal one of which is undertaken by its central freedom of  information team. OFMDFM carries out functions that have no equivalent in the  Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office or in the Department of the Taoiseach, both of which  have a very set role. OFMDFM carries out departmental functions that its  equivalents do not.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The additional &pound;2&middot;3 million is being used to build up  private offices as a result of devolution. Private-office staff will be a  charge set against OFMDFM, although I think that those staff will have come  from other parts of the Civil Service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will note that the Office of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister gave back moneys over  the course of the monitoring round, so the additional funding equates to  a net increase of over &pound;1 million.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for making a statement  on behalf of the Executive. I sympathise with his having to use money to  curb overcommitment &mdash; money that would otherwise have been available for significant reallocation. That remedial curb is  necessary, for all the reasons that the Minister has outlined.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I correct the Minister on the reference that he made to the 19% rate increase. If he checks back, he  will find that the direct rule  Administration&rsquo;s justification for that increase had nothing to do with  the reinvestment and reform initiative (RRI) but was for the purpose of making  it easy for incoming Ministers to proceed on water charges without there being  a significant rates increase.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment understands the reasons behind some reductions. However, as  Chairperson of that Committee, I ask the Minister whether he can offer some  assurance that the significant reductions in selective financial assistance,  land acquisition, the renewable energy budget and skills and science funding  should not be read as underperformance on the part of Invest NI.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Member makes a good point. In many cases, it is unavoidable that those  reductions occur. I do not blame any Minister for that. I far prefer that  Ministers say that, for one reason or another, funds will not be used in a  financial year because they can be better used. Each of the Departments has  been making bids for funds to be used in different ways. It is one thing for a  Department to deal with a large over&shy;commitment when it has growth in its  spend, but if it has a tight financial framework to adhere to and a large overcommitment, it is in a very difficult position  indeed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as the Member&rsquo;s apologia about the 19% rate increase  is concerned, I would be more convinced about that were it not for the fact  that the direct rule Administration had increased the regional rate by 62% in  the past five years and 37% in the past three years. That seems to have been a  necessary trend, because they could not borrow from the RRI unless they kept  ahead of increases in Great    Britain, which were considerable over those  years.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  How many claims for flood relief have been approved, and how was the figure of &pound;1&middot;5  million determined?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Flood relief was an area in which the people of Northern Ireland saw the benefit of  devolution. The Assembly was able to respond immediately to a crisis in the  community and alleviate the hardship caused by flooding of approximately 1,160  people. The Department of the Environment was allocated &pound;1&middot;5 million, of which  roughly &pound;300,000 will go to district  councils for implementation of the scheme.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I welcome the statement by the Minister, particularly concerning two points.  Given previous delays in building social housing &mdash; which housing associations  have blamed on planning delays, tendering, land acquisition et cetera &mdash; is the  Minister convinced that the &pound;20&middot;4 million in additional funding made available  at this late stage can be spent by the end of the financial year?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">Schools may be thrown into chaos again in two weeks because of the  classroom assistants&rsquo; dispute. Has the Minister of Education made any  application for additional funding in this monitoring round to resolve that?</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  How is it that the most awkward questions come from one&rsquo;s own colleagues?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister for Social Development bid for the additional  funds for social housing, and therefore believes that they can be spent in this  financial year. We have to assume that the Minister has schemes that are ready  to run, where land acquisition has already taken place and planning has already  been approved. As the Member knows, if the Minister has to wait for planning  permission the financial year will be over. Therefore, I suspect that the  schemes identified by the Minister are ready to run.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Education has identified a potential  pressure in the classroom assistants&rsquo; dispute, but &mdash; as the Member knows &mdash; that  dispute has not yet been resolved. Consequently, at this stage, the Executive  do not know whether the boards can deal with that on their own, whether they  will need assistance from the Department, or whether the Department will need  assistance from the centre. Those matters can be dealt with in the December  monitoring round.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member provided me with another good opportunity to  highlight the benefits of not over&shy;committing and of having funds available for  in-year monitoring. There are funds available to deal with any emergencies that  occur; therefore, if the centre is required to deal with that dispute, it too  will be dealt with in the December monitoring round.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: I  welcome the monitoring round, especially the &pound;20&middot;4 million for new social  housing. How much money is going into co-ownership to help young first-time  buyers get on the property ladder?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: The Minister for Social Development is better suited to answer  that question. However, I have found that the main issue in co-ownership is its  current level, which is something that the Minister must examine. Undoubtedly,  if the Minister does do that, she will come back to me saying that I should  fund it because it was my idea. It is of real benefit to the community if  people have a stake in their own property. I welcome the Member&rsquo;s remarks about  the money for social housing. I indicated in the draft Budget speech that I  thought that the Executive would have to revisit that area if they can free more  resources through asset sales.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister for Social Development has targets, which were  set down in the Semple Report, and she and I will be keen to get close to, if  not beyond, those targets as the years develop.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: Two  weeks ago, the Minister set out the draft Budget with departmental allocations.  Can he inform the House what percentage of their initial allocations  Departments have spent in recent years?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I will not detail the underspends of each Department, because they vary  considerably. However, Departments such as the Department for Regional  Development and the Department of Health are capable of spending close to their  limits. The Department of Health, for instance, can spend its money by allocating funds to trusts, and the  Department for Regional Development can spend a lot of its money in such areas as maintenance. Therefore, the  underspends of those Departments are low. In the past financial year,  95% of resources were spent and 5% were not. That equates to a considerable  resource underspend of approximately &pound;370 million. I make that point because I  have read reports in the newspapers of people who would have liked more money  for one Department or another. It would be a good start if the Departments  would spend the money that they have.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I am particularly interested in what the Minister has just said. I welcome his  statement, his determination and his encouragement of his ministerial  colleagues to make sure that they properly spend their funding allocations. Can  the Minister assure the House that changes as a result of each monitoring round  are taken in consultation with the Executive to ensure a strategic &mdash; rather  than piecemeal &mdash; approach to reallocations? Will he outline what steps were  taken to ensure that that approach was taken in this monitoring round?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  First, my officials talked with officials from the Departments, who attempted  to identify projects and programmes that are not moving at the expected speed  and from which, therefore, money could come forward. Secondly, they invited  bids from each of the Departments, and they looked at the pressures faced by  each Department: the more inescapable pressures were, obviously, dealt with  first. Finally, my statement went before the Executive, who unanimously  endorsed it &mdash; and I am one of the Ministers who accepts Executive decisions and  works within the Executive&rsquo;s authority.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. There are two issues that I want to raise,  the first of which relates to unfinished business. On 25 June &mdash; when the  Minister outlined his previous quarterly report &mdash; there was some tension  between his recorded figure for the  Department for Employment and Learning and that which the Committee had  been given. Subsequently, I asked an Assembly question about that matter and  raised it at a Committee meeting. I was advised that an answer was being  prepared, but to date no answer has been forthcoming. I remind the Minister  that he said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I will ask my officials to look back at the available  information, and if the Committee has come across an issue, I will write to the  Member about that.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 23, No 1, p5, col 2].</span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">To avoid doubt and to reconcile the figures, it  would be helpful if the Minister could confirm what the situation in June was  as soon as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 25 October, with regard to end-year flexibility, the  Minister said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I have also been  able to secure the significant front-loading of those resources to enable us to  address the costs that Departments will face as we move to restructure and  reform the way in which we organise and deliver public services.&rdquo; <span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 24,  No 10, p 492, col 2].</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Considering those comments and the new arrangements  regarding end-year flexibility, will the introduction of new initiatives, say,  by the Health Minister &mdash; who was here a moment ago &mdash; on access to fertility  services in Northern Ireland, which might arise following last week&rsquo;s debate,  be precluded? The Minister says that the end-year flexibility money will be for  restructuring and reforming the way in which our public services are organised  and delivered.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  If an issue that the Member raised at a previous debate has escaped my  attention, I will tie a knot in my hanky and ensure that he receives a response  that will reconcile &mdash; if possible &mdash; the figures that he believes do not marry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">By its very nature, end-year flexibility is a one-off expenditure and, therefore, cannot be used for  recurrent purposes. That means that first, we must identify issues that  can be dealt with in the financial year in question, and secondly, those  matters cannot be dealt with again in future financial years. Therefore,  end-year flexibility is somewhat restricted. However, if Departments worked  cleverly, they could identify other areas for consideration and for which a  one-off expenditure would be necessary.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been a fair bit of controversy about the health  budget. I cannot understand the reason for that, given the greater-than-average  increase that it received in the draft Budget. However, no Department will ever  have enough money: every Department could use more funds if they were  available. The Executive must look at the needs of all Departments when they  prepare their Budget, and they must be able  to allocate resources fairly. That was done in the case of the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. That Department has  been taking a larger chunk of the Budget year on year, so that by the end of  the three-year cycle that was referred to in the draft Budget, it will have  received up to 48% of all the money that comes to Northern Ireland through the block  grant. That is a considerable sum, and it is more than any Health Minister has  ever been allocated in the history of Northern Ireland. That means that  the percentage of the Northern Ireland Budget that goes to health is greater  than ever.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. Does he share my concerns, and those of  the wider community &mdash; particularly the construction industry and its sister  services &mdash; about the failure to deliver the &pound;14&middot;5 million of capital that is in  the integrated development fund (IDF)? Can the Minister further break down the  cost of those projects? Will he commit to having a review of whether the delivery  mechanisms are fit for purpose?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: The fund was set up by the Secretary of State, and allocations  could be made only where projects were submitted for consideration. All the  projects that were submitted were dealt with. That being the case, there is not  much more that Ministers can do: if projects are not being submitted, that may  mean that there is limited use for that kind of funding and the money could be  put to better use, which is what we are attempting to do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have had several conversations with construction industry  representatives, and in recent discussions I have spoken with every element of  the construction industry. More than anything, that industry needs a continuity of spend by the Executive, and it is  seriously concerned about massive capital underspends. The industry  needs a steady flow of funds throughout the years to enable it to manage  properly its end of overall business, which is an important function that it  carries out for Government. Systems must be developed in order that each  Department can judge more accurately when it will spend money. That will ensure  that there is no waste and no consequent damage to the construction industry.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  Can the Minister say whether the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety submitted any bids? Is there any specific allocation for the  provision of services for those who have mental-health problems and learning  disabilities? That is the most  under-resourced area of health provision, yet it has the most potential  to make a positive impact on all areas of society.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety submitted two bids:  one to accelerate the comprehensive spending review&rsquo;s efficiency action plan;  and another that went under the heading of dealing with pressures in health and  social care trusts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It was judged that the pressures from other Depart&shy;ments were greater. The pressures on DRD went  beyond its allocation, which meant that it did not get the full  allocation that it sought.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Children (Emergency Protection Orders) Bill</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Accelerated Passage</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Children (Emergency Protection Orders) Bill proceed  under the accelerated passage procedure, in accordance with Standing Order  40(4).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will repeal article 64(8) of the Children (Northern Ireland)  Order 1995. An emergency protection order (EPO) issued by the courts under that  legislation gives the applicant &mdash; usually a health and social care trust &mdash; the  power to remove a child to a safe place in the event of an emergency. EPOs are  used only in exceptional circumstances, such as when a child is at immediate  risk of harm, and are short-term measures allowing investigations to take place  and alternative arrangements to be made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Under current legislation, parents or others may apply to  have an EPO discharged; however, the case cannot be heard until three days have  elapsed. During recent judicial review proceedings, a judge determined that a  three-day delay in conducting such a hearing breached articles 6 and 8 of the  European Convention on Human Rights: the right to a fair trial, and the right  to respect for private and family life.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Having taken the advice of professionals in the Department  and in the voluntary sector, I am satisfied that the removal of article 64(8)  would not result in any reduction in the levels of protection available to  vulnerable children. Therefore, Members should act swiftly to repeal the offending provision. I am requesting  accelerated passage for the Bill because it is essential that our legislation  be consistent and compatible with human rights legislation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In such a case, I consider it preferable that the  legislature be given the opportunity to remedy the situation by passing the  required Bill. A failure to take prompt  action might result in the European    Court striking down the offending article.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise the importance of the role played by the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public  Safety and the Assembly in scrutinising draft legislation, and I regret  that these unique circumstances necessitate accelerated  passage for this Bill. I hope that the Assembly will accept my assurance  that such a procedure is appropriate only  in the most exceptional of circumstances.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  On 11 October, the Minister attended a meeting of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety in order to explain his reasons for requesting  accelerated passage for the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Chairperson of that Committee, I am aware of the  significance of the Committee Stage in passing legislation, the importance of  examining proposed legislation in detail, and, where appropriate, the ability  to summon witnesses and listen to the views of interested parties. However, in exceptional circumstances, it may  be necessary to proceed more urgently. In such cases, of course, there is still  an opportunity for Members to debate the issues in a plenary sitting.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister explained to the Committee &mdash; as he has done  today &mdash; that, in a recent judicial review, the High Court determined that article 64(8) of the Children  (Northern Ireland)  Order 1995 was incompatible with articles 6 and 8 of the European  Convention on Human Rights. This short, two-clause, Bill will remove that  incompatibility by repealing article 64(8) of the 1995 Order.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that High Court decision, I accept the need for  urgency, and, in the circumstances, the Committee supports the Minister&rsquo;s  request that the Children (Emergency Protection Orders) Bill be granted  accelerated passage.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: The circumstances, as outlined  by the Members who have spoken, point to the fact that we can do little else except support the Minister, and  I hope that everyone in the House will accept that position and allow the  legislation to go forward.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I thank the Members who contributed to the debate for their remarks about this  important piece of legislation. I welcome their support for the granting of  accelerated passage to the Bill, and I am pleased that it can now move to its  Second Stage.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before we proceed to the Question, I remind Members that the  motion requires cross-community support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved (with cross-community support):</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Children (Emergency Protection Orders) Bill proceed  under the accelerated passage procedure, in accordance with Standing Order  40(4).</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="4"></a>Children (Emergency Protection Orders) Bill:</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Second Stage</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Children (Emergency Protection  Orders) Bill (NIA 6/07) be agreed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill repeals article 64(8) of the Children (Northern Ireland)  Order 1995. I have outlined the background to the Bill, but, to recap, an  emergency protection order (EPO) is a court order under the Children (Northern Ireland)  Order 1995 which gives the applicant the power in an emergency situation to  remove a child to a safe place. Such orders are used only in exceptional circumstances,  when a child is at immediate risk of harm, and are a short-term measure while  an investigation takes place or alternative arrangements are made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Under the current legislation, parents or others can apply  to have the order discharged, but the case cannot be heard for three days.  However, in recent judicial review  proceedings, a judge has determined that delaying the hearing for three  days is a breach of articles 6 and 8 of the European Convention on Human  Rights, interfering with the right to a fair trial and the right to respect for  family life. Therefore, the judge is minded to strike down article 64(8).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Having taken the advice of professionals in the Department  and the voluntary sector, I am satisfied that  removing that article will not result in any reduction in the levels of  protection available for vulnerable children. Therefore, the Assembly should  act swiftly to repeal the offending provision. The sole purpose and effect of  the Bill is to remove article 64(8) of the 1995 Order, which is the element  that delays for three days the hearing of  an application to discharge an emergency protection order.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The explanatory and financial memorandum states that any financial implications are likely to be  minimal, as the amendment merely enables cases to be heard in a shorter  time; that a preliminary equality impact assessment has identified no potential  adverse impacts on any of the nine equality categories; and that a regulatory  impact assessment did not produce any evidence that repealing the offending  provision would have an adverse impact on competition, nor that it would incur  additional costs for employers or those in the voluntary or community sectors.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  As I said during the debate on accelerated passage for this Bill, the Committee  has accepted the Minister&rsquo;s explanation of the need for the legislation to be  taken forward urgently. It is based on the outcome of a recent judicial review  in the High Court, which determined that article 64(8) of the Children (Northern Ireland)  Order 1995 was incompatible with articles 6 and 8 of the European Convention on  Human Rights.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation centres on the right of a parent to seek  legal redress where a child has been removed from his or her care under an  emergency protection order. At present,  under article 64(8), that cannot happen until 72 hours after the making  of the order.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has assured the Committee that the repeal of  that particular article will not affect in any way the power of social  services, or the police, to seek an emergency protection order where it is  considered necessary. The change will simply mean that a parent or guardian will be able to seek legal redress  immediately, rather than having to wait for three days.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that all Members agree that to remove a child from his or her parents is one of the most  traumatic and serious actions that social services, or the police, can  take. I am sure that Members also agree that that power should be used only in  the most exceptional circumstances, in cases in which there are serious  concerns about a child&rsquo;s safety.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the Bill,  which will give a parent or guardian the right to challenge such an  order without having to wait for three days.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. My party and I support the Bill&rsquo;s  being granted accelerated passage. The legislation is a step in the right  direction. Further to what the Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social  Services and Public Safety has said, I welcome the fact that the Minister attended Committee meetings at the earliest  opportunity to explain the purpose of the legislation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill contains a technical amendment to The Children  Order 1995. As I have said, neither I nor my party  has any difficulty in supporting the Bill&rsquo;s provisions. The effect of  the amendment, which the Committee Chairperson and, indeed, the Minister have  already explained, will be to remove the three-day bar on a parent&rsquo;s applying  to a court for the discharge of an emergency protection order.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is appropriate that parents have access to  courts for an earlier hearing, particularly as some EPOs may initially have been  made without parents being there. The Bill recognises the rights of parents in  that regard.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to sound too negative, but I wish to place on  record my disappointment that this Bill is the first piece of legislation that  affects children to come before the House. The new safeguarding arrangements  for children, which were referred to as part of the consultation that the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety participated in last  year, should have appeared in a new  children&rsquo;s Bill. However, in saying  that, I accept the reasons behind the Minister bringing this Bill to the  Assembly, and because of the judgement I agree that there is a need to get this  legislation through the Assembly quickly. I welcome and support the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I thank those Members who have contributed to the debate for their remarks. The  repeal of article 64(8) of The Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 will  remove the incompatibility that exists with articles 6 and 8 of the European  Convention on Human Rights, pursuant to section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In response to Ms Ramsey&rsquo;s point, I, too, accept and regret  that the first piece of legislation that has been introduced on children&rsquo;s matters is to receive accelerated  passage. Both Mrs Robinson and I have expressed that view. However, we are  where we are. A court order is pending on which I must act. As I explained to the Committee for Health, Social Services and  Public Safety last month, that is why I am taking this action.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Once again, I am grateful to those who have contributed to  a helpful debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Second Stage of the Children (Emergency  Protection Orders) Bill [NIA 06/07] be agreed.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="5"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Management of the Fisheries Conservancy Board</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to two hours for  this debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in which to propose and 10 minutes in which to make a  winding-up speech. All other members who wish to speak will have five  minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">After the Order Paper was issued, concerns were expressed about the motion&rsquo;s competence.  Unamended, it would not give the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure  the authority to act. The Members who tabled the motion were alerted to that  difficulty and have duly tabled an amendment, which I have selected for debate.  If the amendment is made, it will address the motion&rsquo;s competence. If the  amendment is not made, I will not put the Question on the motion. On that  basis, we shall proceed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Culture, Arts and  Leisure to appoint a commissioner, or senior civil servant, to manage the  Fisheries Conservancy Board in an effective manner, until legislation is made  to provide for his department to take over the running of the Board.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also beg to move the following amendment: Leave out all  after &ldquo;Leisure&rdquo; and insert</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to assist the Fisheries Conservancy Board in its  management, and calls on the Executive to bring forward legislation abolishing  the Fisheries Conservancy Board and transferring its responsibility to the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure as  a matter of urgency.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank my colleagues from across the three other main  parties for their support and co-sponsorship of the motion and the amendment.  It is fair to say that had five names been allowed on the Order Paper, the  Alliance Party would have joined us in adding one of its Members&rsquo; names.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The key to the original motion calling for a commissioner  or civil servant of senior rank to be appointed to take over management of the  Fisheries Conservancy Board (FCB) lay with the decision, under the review of  public administration (RPA), for functions of the FCB to transfer into the  Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.  Provision for that is included in  the draft Public Authorities Reform (Northern Ireland) Order  2007. However, this is unlikely to pass all the legislative stages before the  spring of 2008 at the earliest. Therefore, action is unlikely to be taken in the foreseeable future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The FCB is not properly fulfilling its main role of  fisheries protection and is falling short of its other responsibilities. I can report to the Assembly the concerns of  the Ulster Angling Federation on a number of fronts. Those issues have been  brought to the notice of all the parties &mdash; hence the unity behind the  amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Not all the co-sponsors of the amendment are in the  Chamber, possibly because business has proceeded so speedily. Perhaps someone  could bring the other co-sponsors into the Chamber to help out. It is not my  job to serve as Whip for other parties, but they may be listening to the debate. However, I welcome the presence of Pat  Ramsey of the SDLP.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Angling Federation brought a report to the  Department of Culture, Art and Leisure in July 2006, only to be advised that its concerns were unfounded and that everything in the FCB was entirely  satisfactory. However, two months later, anglers advised the Department  that the number of boat patrols on Lough Neagh stated to have been made by the  FCB, had not taken place. The FCB workforce of 15 has been reduced to 10, as  one third of the staff are absent on long-term sickness. The board&rsquo;s equipment  has not been maintained, and the boat destined to patrol the east coast is not  even seaworthy. Perhaps the Minister would consider, as the most appropriate  action, an inventory of all the boats held by the FCB, to find out how  seaworthy they are and, indeed, where they are. My understanding is that they  are not available for use.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For those reasons, and others that I will convey later to the House, the motion was tabled. I appreciate  the early notice passed on by the Minister that has necessitated the  amendment. The advice was that the motion was not competent since the Minister  is unable to make the appointment that it called for.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That necessitated the amendment, which I commend to the  House. That amendment is competent and deals with the problem effectively and  efficiently. It seeks to address the problems of the FCB. I look forward to  hearing from the Minister that he will pursue the Executive on the legislation  required to abolish the FCB, thus enabling the transfer of responsibility for  its functions to his Department to proceed as an urgent matter. Perhaps he will  indicate the urgency with which he views the matter and therefore how soon,  after Executive approval, legislation for the transfer of responsibilities from  the FCB to the Department can be completed. The sooner that happens, the  better. The FCB desperately needs to have its management functions and  responsibilities brought into line and improved.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That can be achieved if the amendment  is agreed and acted upon.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister has a role to play in introducing the legislation to the  House before Christmas. If that is the case, it should give the transfer issue  serious consideration and progress it urgently and with the support of the Committee for Culture, Arts and  Leisure. Indeed, it is notable that the proposers of the motion are all  members of that Committee.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that it appears that the issue will be dealt with in  a manner that our angling fraternity will roundly welcome, I give a cautious,  but sincere, appreciation to the Minister&rsquo;s apparent need to act urgently and  in line with the amendment. My caution is in anticipation of the delivery of  any legislation that will abolish the FCB and transfer responsibility to the  Department. I will not, at this stage,  discuss the serious, unsatisfactory aspects of the functioning of the  FCB unless there is a default in processing the amendment, which I do not  anticipate. However, it is best to be clear.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, it is my pleasure to commend the amendment  to the House and seek its full approval.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  The previous Member to speak identified several shortcomings of the Fisheries  Conservancy Board. For example, there are too few bailiffs, almost no prosecutions  for illegal fishing, and anglers have no  confidence in the current arrangements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The board will be abolished under the review of public  administration, and its functions and staff will, in due course, be transferred  to the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure. The appointment of  commissioners, which was contemplated at one stage, would require amending  legislation. However, legislation has been drafted to abolish the board, and that is the fastest method of dealing with what is  currently a very unsatisfactory situation. Provisions to abolish the  board are included in the draft public authority reform Bill, which is scheduled for consideration by the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister. We hope that that will be introduced as quickly as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In abolishing the board, it is important that stakeholders  &mdash; particularly anglers &mdash; are included in the process and that their input is  heard when the Department takes control. To that end, it would be helpful if a  forum were constituted for those who have a particular interest in angling. I  encourage the Minister to develop such a proposal. Not only would it be good to have stakeholders involved by keeping  them well informed about events, but their expertise, insight and  knowledge would improve plans for the future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Additional support would be required in order to manage the amalgamation of the Fisheries  Conservancy Board with the Department  of Culture, Arts and Leisure. The chief executive officer of the FCB  will need additional support to implement the many changes that will be  required, and we must support the board to ensure that any such changes will be  made effectively and efficiently. Indeed, that has been highlighted in our  amendment, to which I am sure the Minister will refer in due course.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The FCB is facing a funding crisis. It was set up to be  financially self-sufficient, and to derive its income through agency work and  from the sale of fishing licences. However, the board now faces financial  difficulties that have been caused by the loss of agency work that it had  undertaken on behalf of the Environment and Heritage Service (EHS). As a  result, 11 board staff were made redundant in May 2006. At present, the board  can function only with substantial Government funding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that the angling community does not have  confidence in the board to carry out its remit, which includes bailiff duties and bringing forward prosecutions. It is well known that there have been serious  difficulties and shortcomings in the organisation. That must be borne in  mind as progress is made. It would be helpful if those internal problems were  kept in mind as the FCB&rsquo;s responsibilities are transferred to DCAL. There is little point in transferring the board&rsquo;s  existing problems to DCAL. Therefore,  there must be a process that ensures that the board is not simply  transferred in its current state. There is  a need for substantial change and, perhaps, for new personnel to be  involved in future work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am happy to support the motion, which represents the best way forward. I am sure that DCAL will  provide the resources that are required to support the FCB and to bring  it properly, effectively and efficiently under the Department&rsquo;s responsibility  in order to ensure a good future for angling in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I am grateful to Mr McNarry for proposing the motion, to which many parties  have signed up. Mr McNarry has raised several points about staffing and about  boats that are not seaworthy. I am aware of one such boat.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The serious problems of understaffing and under-resourcing  must be dealt with, and I wish to make some arguments in favour of that.  Naturally, everyone is concerned about conservation and the condition of  rivers. In the light of the Executive&rsquo;s emphasis on the economy, it is worth making strong economic arguments for  investment in the conservation of rivers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The recent job losses in Limavady have highlighted people&rsquo;s  vulnerability to sudden economic shock. The long-term answer to that is to  build as diverse an indigenous economy as possible. In order to do that, and  for the economy to become as self-reliant as possible, every available resource  must be harnessed. Clearly, tourism is one industry that can grow in the North.  High-value-added tourism, in particular, is attracted by high-quality leisure  activities. That is one reason why the Culture Arts and Leisure Committee is so  committed to sports, as is the Minister. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s presence for  the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Fishing can contribute hugely to the economy. There is no  doubt that anglers and clubs across Northern Ireland have invested  hugely in their own stock, which must be protected. However, that is not being  protected at present. In the Republic   of Ireland, it is  estimated that the angling industry contributes &euro;55 million a year to the  economy. The river-fishing industry must be taken seriously. There is no doubt  that there would be a good return on such investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As MLA for Foyle in Derry,  I feel fortunate that the Loughs Agency is responsible for Lough Foyle as well  as for Carlingford Lough. That is a highly visible, properly resourced and  well-managed organisation and its work brings great benefits to those regions.  The fact that it is a cross-border organisation and that it operates under  identical legislation North and South means that it can look after complete  river systems. The border is totally transparent in the agency&rsquo;s conservation  and enforcement work. Indeed, the Loughs Agency has been so successful that the  rivers that are under its control are the only ones in Ireland where salmon can be fished  because the stocks are so healthy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister, with his counterpart in the Republic, must  give strong consideration to ensuring that all cross-border rivers are  similarly protected by a single cross-border agency that operates under a  single piece of legislation. That would make sense from a practical  environmental-protection point of view and would pave the way for future  changes in the way that the Fisheries Conservancy Board is set up and funded.  Perhaps those matters should also be considered. There are specific problems  that relate to cross-border rivers that are outside the remit of the Loughs  Agency and cannot be resolved properly by  two separate organisations that work under different  environmental-protection legislation in separate jurisdictions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There have been problems about the way in which the  Fisheries Conservancy Board has operated and been resourced. It is unfair to  lay blame on anyone in particular. However, a new management structure and a  properly funded organisation must be put in place, and I acknowledge the  amendment. Nevertheless, we need a firm commitment from the Minister that the  necessary legislation and new structures will be put in place with immediate  effect. If there is to be a delay, interim measures must be taken and put in  place to ensure that, in the meantime, the  waterways are protected.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The timing of the matter is hugely important, given that anglers &mdash; many of whom are in the Public  Gallery today &mdash; are given some comfort by, and respect from, the  Department as regards their investment. Given that there is consensus among the  parties on the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure, it is right and fitting  that the Minister introduces that legislation immediately. If not, the Minister  must appoint a commissioner to manage the asset that is already there, because  it is deteriorating and becoming dilapidated.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  Will the Member agree with me, and bring to the attention of the Minister,  that, in addition to the matter of a new administration and management of  fisheries, poaching still poses a great threat to many of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s rivers,  especially the River Foyle? Will the Member agree with me that the Minister  should liaise with all authorities, including the Police Service, so that poaching  is brought to an end? In the past, there has not been enough manpower to tackle  the problem.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I agree with the Member. The Ulster Angling Federation, which represents many  fishermen across Northern    Ireland, is deeply worried. The proposers of  the motion are also worried. Fishing stocks must be protected by properly  resourced bailiffs or whoever is  responsible for them. At present, sufficient resources are not  available; the manpower and boats needed to protect fishing stocks are not there.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful that David McNarry proposed the motion. It is  an issue on which there is unanimity and consensus among members of the  Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure, which I hope will continue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Much has already been said on this important  subject. During the Assembly&rsquo;s first mandate, I was a member of the  Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure that undertook a major inquiry into  angling and fishing across Northern    Ireland. I am disappointed that we are no  further forward on the matter now than we were back then. Angling and fishing  are major tourism attractions. During the previous inquiry into the matter, I  was amazed to be told that on Saturday afternoons, as many people are fishing  and angling in Northern    Ireland as are attending FA football  matches. That being the case, it is incumbent on the Minister and the  Department to ensure that every effort is made to encourage and advance the sport in every way possible. Angling  and fishing bring much enjoyment to many people. There should be no excuse for  a Department that fails in its duty to promote what is best for the fishing and  angling community in Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my Strangford constituency, a disused quarry had been  used for fishing for many years. People used the  facility and enjoyed it. Suddenly, the owner decided that it was no  longer to be used for fishing. The quarry was drained, and the fish were lying  about all over the place. I raised the  matter with the Fisheries Conservancy Board, and I received a reply that  almost dismissed what had happened. Although I am not an angler, I know that  legislation prohibits the quarry owner&rsquo;s actions. Nevertheless, the Fisheries  Conservancy Board was dismissive in its response to my concerns.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of the  Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure, I have great pleasure in  supporting the motion. As a maximum of four names can be included on a list of  proposers of a motion, my name is not included.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry did, however, clarify my position. I fully agree  with all members of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure that something  must be done, and done soon.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I support the amendment, and I thank my colleagues for raising what is an  important matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I represent a largely urban part of the eastern seaboard.  Over the years, it has been wonderful to watch the efforts that have been made  to bring back to life once-dead rivers. Those efforts have been largely down to  anglers, who put their hands in their own pocket, used their expertise and  worked alongside the agencies as best they could, often in fairly difficult  situations. The jewels in the crown are the River Foyle and other major  systems, but it has been a delight to watch the eastern seaboard rivers &mdash; those  shorter rivers that run into the Irish Sea &mdash;  come back to life. The Three Mile Water in my constituency is about six miles  from Belfast  city centre. It now has salmon stocks for the first time in probably 150 to 200  years, and that is thanks to the work of the local angling club in Monkstown  and the support that it received from those very overworked, and sometimes  undervalued, members of the Fisheries Conservancy Board. Unfortunately, the board was never given the  wherewithal to develop properly the role that it was given when it was  set up in 1966. It was underfunded, and other Members have mentioned that lack  of funding and how we have had to bail the FCB out in the past.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that our rivers are properly bailiffed and  policed, because our fishing stock faces many dangers, both natural and human.  If we are ever to move our tourist industry forward, fishing must play a  central role. Most of the rivers that have been mentioned run through rural  areas, so an opportunity exists to develop rural economies. Rivers must be  properly stocked and managed, and they must be looked after by people who have  a real feel for their angling potential. Those people must be willing to share  those rivers with tourists, who will pay good money to stand along the banks  and successfully land salmon, trout and any other species of fish in which they  are interested. The very best that the House can do is to ensure that a process  is in place that allows the Minister to  redress urgently a problem that is obviously detrimental to our rivers&rsquo;  angling potential.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank my colleagues who have contributed to the debate.  They have covered most of the issues, so there is no sense in my regurgitating them. Thanks to everyone who looks after the best interests of angling in Northern <span style="letter-spacing:0pt; ">Ireland</span>, we at least have something to pass over to the Minister. I hope that he  will have the knowledge and expertise  at his disposal to allow us to solve this problem, and solve it  urgently.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  I represent East Belfast, which Members will  agree is not renowned for its inland or salmon fishing. However, I must declare  an interest in the subject, because, believe it or not, I am a qualified marine  biologist. That said, my knowledge of fisheries conservation is somewhat limited,  as I spent three years specialising in the study of the orientation of Talitrus  saltator and Orchestia gammarella. For those who do not understand or speak  Latin, those are types of sandhopper. Members will understand that my knowledge  is, therefore, somewhat limited.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Having said all that, as a member of the Committee for  Culture, Arts and Leisure, I support the motion  as amended. It is imperative that the Department of Culture, Arts and  Leisure, which is responsible for policy, also be directly responsible for the  management of the functions that the Fisheries Conservancy Board currently  carries out. Those functions include the conservation and protection of our  salmon and inland fisheries.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As we have heard, the Fisheries Conservancy Board carries  out a bailiff service for the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, and it  also undertakes agency work for the Department of the Environment. Surely, in  the interests of cost and of efficiency and effectiveness, it makes sense for  the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure to have responsibility for strategy  and management functions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The case for those changes is further illustrated by FCB  submissions that acknowledge that there are several potential advantages in  being managed by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in areas such as  decision-making, streamlining of decisions and procedural regulation, as well as integration of functions within  wider Government networks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleagues on the Committee for Culture, Arts and  Leisure have already made all the major points on matters of strategy. I ask  the House to join me in supporting the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Members who proposed  the motion; I also support the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It must be acknowledged  that the FCB did a reasonable job in  very difficult circumstances and would have been able to carry out its duties more efficiently and effectively had  it been provided with the necessary financial resources. That is the crux of  the argument: essential resources have to be made available to enable us to  monitor and safeguard our waterways in a professional manner.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In its response to the further consultation document on the  review of public administration, the FCB stated that it had been:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;constrained by factors largely outside its control,  particularly the unsatisfactory nature of its funding arrangements, and could  be radically improved by new approaches and adequate additional funding.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In a written question, Strangford MLA Jim Shannon asked the  Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to detail the budget currently allocated  to the Fisheries Conservancy Board, and whether that budget would be increased.  The Minister told Mr Shannon that the Department had budgeted &pound;464,000 for the  FCB for 2007-08, which includes payment for bailiffing services. Perhaps he  will tell the House what amount of additional funding will be directed to the  board upon its incorporation into the Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Any new arrangements must have public support, particularly  among the angling community. The new arrangements must be truly transparent and  provide for the participation of experienced anglers. Those people have  influence in their communities and must not be excluded from the  decision-making process. It is vital that fishermen and women have a real  feeling of ownership of any changes to fisheries development and conservation.  There must be no loss or reduction of stakeholder involvement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Every Member can name several instances of water pollution.  A couple of instances affected South Down, including one in July 2006 on the  River Shimna near Newcastle  in which 1,500 fish died. That incident was thought to have been caused by a  discharge of sewage from a Water Service  pumping station. Around the same time  in County Down, another 1,500 fish died as a  result of chemical pollution in the  River Lagan at Donaghcloney. That incident happened after &pound;250,000 had  been spent on the enhancement of the Lagan at Donaghcloney in an attempt to  reintroduce native fish. A five-to-six-year  plan was wiped out overnight by the third chemical spillage to hit the  river in the past six years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Incidents of pollution such as those that I have described  not only have a devastating impact on fish stocks and the biodiversity of the  waterways, but on the tourism industry. Greater transparency and accountability  are required, and that can only be delivered by an independent environmental  protection agency that scrutinises all Departments. There must be rigorous  enforcement of the laws that hold polluters to account. In order to ensure public confidence in the effectiveness of the  proposed arrangements to integrate the FCB into the Department of Culture, Arts  and Leisure, it is essential that any new agency must be a powerful advocate  for the environment. There must be a real emphasis on preventing damage to the  environment, rather than dealing with the aftermath of pollution.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I declare an interest as a keen angler. I was delighted to listen to the Lord  Browne&rsquo;s knowledgeable comments on the subject. I look forward to talking to him soon, because he can obviously teach  me a lot. I welcome the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that the motion has gained the support of the  four main political groupings in the Assembly. As ever, Mr McCarthy has  delivered the support of the Alliance Party,  and the DUP appreciates that. Therefore, it seems that the amended  motion will have the full support of the House, and I welcome that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That sends out a clear signal to all those who have an  interest in this matter that the present arrangements are not sufficient: they  are inadequate and they are not delivering. To put it in a different way, the  current arrangements are not fit for purpose. I hope that the House will fully  appreciate the advantages and the enormous  benefit that angling can bring to the Northern Ireland economy. A large number of people participate in  angling. Mr McCarthy drew a parallel with the numbers who participate in other  sports, and it is true that angling is the largest participatory recreation in Northern Ireland.  I hope that that fact is not lost on the Assembly or on the outside world.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The obvious spin-off that angling brings to the tourist  industry is phenomenal &mdash; I do not use that word lightly; I use it properly. Northern Ireland has some of the finest rivers  for salmon and trout fishing anywhere in Europe.  Many tourists come from the rest of the United   Kingdom, the Republic  of Ireland and Europe to fish in Northern Ireland  waters. Sometimes, that fact is lost on people who do not take such a keen  interest in angling as a recreation. I emphasise that point and I wish to  ensure that this issue is dealt with. I am pleased that the Assembly has such a  motion before it after such a short time in existence. It is vital that the  motion has the full support of the House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted that the Minister is in the Chamber, and I  have little doubt that he will take a keen interest in what has been said. More  importantly, I have no doubt that he will seek to reflect the views that have  been articulated in the House. I thank the Minister for his attendance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland boasts some of the finest destinations  for angling enthusiasts. I doubt that anywhere else in Europe has the  facilities or the potential for angling that exist in Northern Ireland. Therefore, it  must be ensured that angling is overseen by a fit organisation. Sadly, that is  not presently the case. The Fisheries Conservancy Board has done what it could,  but it has reached its sell-by date and changes are necessary. Those changes  must be implemented at the earliest opportunity. If changes are not introduced,  angling will be hit hard and the tourist industry will also suffer. Our rivers  are among our greatest natural assets and they must be kept at the forefront of our priorities. In the past,  our natural assets have not been adequately protected.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, I notice that my time is up, and I am  sure that you are about to inform me of that. I commend the motion to the House  and I look forward to its receiving the unanimous support of the House.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I support the motion, as amended. Last month, I had the privilege of attending  a meeting with the Kilkeel Angling Club at the Kilmory Arms Hotel in Kilkeel.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank David McNarry, who was at that meeting, for living  up to his promise to bring this issue to the Assembly, and I thank those who  endorsed the motion. As Lord Morrow said, the benefit of a cross-party motion  is that it makes it easier for the Minister to take on board what is happening  and to act accordingly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Pat Ramsey said almost everything that I wanted to say. I  would only change Lough Foyle to Carlingford Lough, because I live on its  shores, whereas Pat lives in the Foyle area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members spoke, I thought of Jim Wilson, a former  Assembly Member for South Antrim. He talked  about fisheries in the House, in the basement, in upstairs Members&rsquo; rooms of  this Building, and even when he was out socially. He has a great interest in  fishing and I am sure that he will appreciate that the motion represents  progress.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have nothing more to say other than that I wish to go on  record as supporting the amendment on behalf of those who petitioned me to  support their case.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr Poots)</strong>: I thank the Members who brought the  motion and the amendment to the House, thereby enabling Members to debate the  important issue of the management of the Fisheries Conservancy Board.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As has been stated,  angling is not just an important recreation; it has a major role to play  in the lives of people in Northern    Ireland. Many people are employed as a consequence of angling and, with  correct handling, opportunities for tourism can be developed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many of the factories that caused pollution along the  rivers have disappeared. The Nitrates Directive should ensure that there is  significantly less pollution of rivers from agricultural sources, and there  will be further investment by the Water Service. Therefore, if well managed,  the rivers should host many more fish than has been the case for many years.  There is a great opportunity to promote tourism and, with proper development,  to increase the potential income derived from fisheries.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In considering the  motion, my uppermost consideration was the importance of conservation  and the protection of salmon in inland fisheries, which is defined in  legislation. The Fisheries Conservancy Board is a statutory body that was  established by the Fisheries Act (Northern Ireland) 1966. Under the  provision of that Act, the board is responsible for the conservation and  protection of the salmon and inland fisheries of Northern Ireland, other than  in the areas around Londonderry and Newry, which are the responsibility of the  Loughs Agency of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission. Members  have referred to its work in those areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At this stage, I should point out that the commission  employs twice as many people as are employed in inland fisheries across Northern Ireland.  That decision was made by previous Administrations and remains in force today. However, perhaps that should be  readdressed and a greater commitment of resources to inland waterways  and fisheries should perhaps be considered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">FCB also undertakes bailiffing of the public angling estate  and, until recently, carried out river monitoring and pollution investigation on behalf of the Department of the  Environment. As Members have mentioned, following an investigation by the Audit  Office and the Public Accounts Committee, it was recommended that the  Environment and Heritage Service (EHS) brought those functions in-house. Consequently,  the FCB lost responsibility to EHS for some of the services that it had  previously provided and had to lay off several staff. I understand that EHS is  able to deliver the services at a lower cost. Therefore, to one extent, one  Department was funding another Department, but it was, nonetheless, all public  money. As a consequence, fewer people can carry out the dual role of bailiff  and of examiner of water quality.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Statutory membership of the board is set out in schedule 2  to the Fisheries Act (Northern    Ireland) 1966.  Members are nominated by various organisations and representative  bodies, and one member is also a  departmental official. The chief executive&rsquo;s post is provided for in the  schedule.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The board is to be abolished under the review of public  administration and its functions and staff will be transferred to the  Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.  Abolition of the board will create opportunities to reorganise the  conservation and protection of inland fisheries.  The transfer of FCB functions to the Department of Culture, Arts and  Leisure will unify fisheries policy and functions and streamline the  decision-making and regulatory processes. It will also create an opportunity to  rationalise traditional enforcement with modern fishery management practice.  The transfer will allow for the integration of expertise and resources in the  Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure to provide for a strategic approach.  Plans are well advanced to ensure that functions transfer seamlessly and that  work teams are established and briefed at the outset.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">FCB resources and expertise will be incorporated into the  Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure regional operations. Area management  will deploy staff to detect and respond to reports of illegal fishing, and, as  appropriate, they will work with partners and stakeholders, including private  water bailiffs, fishery owners and the PSNI.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Organisational restructuring has been planned, resource  needs have been assessed, and bids have been made to provide for a more integrated  and strategic conservation and protection service. Policy and strategy will be  reviewed in the light of priorities and emerging best practice in fisheries  management to ensure that the service is consistent with public needs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Abolition of the Fisheries Conservancy Board and the  transfer of its functions to my Department can only be achieved by changing the  Fisheries Act (Northern    Ireland) 1966. Provision for that is  included in the draft public authorities reform Bill,<strong> </strong>which will be  taken forward by the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister.  The Bill has been included in the legislative programme for the 2007-08  Assembly session, and two Executive meetings ago<strong>,</strong> I stressed the  importance of bringing it forward as quickly as possible. I would appreciate it  if the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister were to bring the  Bill forward in the autumn session, as opposed to the spring session, so that we can deal with the matter more quickly.  I trust that today&rsquo;s debate will help to encourage that process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The timing of the transfer will depend on when the Bill is  passed, and I hope that Members will facilitate its passage through the Assembly as quickly as possible to  facilitate a timely transfer of the functions of the FCB to my Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards management of the transition period; Members will be aware of press reports about the  FCB. It continues to face serious management issues, and I remain concerned to ensure that the closure and  transition to my Department should be carried out smoothly, effectively  and efficiently, and that any ongoing management  issues in the FCB are handled professionally during the transition. A  fisheries management group, chaired by a senior civil servant, has been  established to oversee the closure and  transfer of the FCB&rsquo;s statutory functions to the Department. That group  has examined the structures and reporting lines required in the Department and  will manage the functions, staff and operations  when they are transferred into the Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A review of public administration working group has been  established within the Department of  Culture, Arts and Leisure and includes financial  and legal representatives. The group is meeting with FCB staff regularly to discuss and plan the winding-up process.  Preparations are under way to facilitate the transfer of the board&rsquo;s functions,  with officials working closely with the board and its staff to identify and  undertake the tasks associated with the winding-up of the board and the  transfer of its functions, staff and liabilities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A consultation forum meets regularly to update FCB staff  and trade union representatives on progress on the winding-up and legislative  processes. The forum also provides an opportunity for staff to communicate  concerns or raise issues for clarification with the Department. Quarterly  accountability and monitoring meetings are held to oversee and monitor  governance and financial activity, and I have asked my Department to ensure  that those meetings happen monthly, with immediate effect. Fisheries  Conservancy Board management is also updated at those meetings on progress on  closure and transfer matters. The DCAL representative on the FCB also updates  board members on an ongoing basis.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have asked my departmental officials to ensure that  conservation of salmon and inland fisheries is afforded a high priority,  particularly during the transitional period. Therefore, the Department has,  when possible, taken steps to support the operational activities of the board,  while remaining sensitive to the legal position whereby the board has  responsibility for the statutory functions set out in the Fisheries Act (Northern Ireland)  1966. That is particularly important when legal enforcement of the fisheries  by-laws is required, such as in cases of pollution or poaching.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The FCB &mdash; not the Department &mdash; is the only legal entity  that can enforce such by-laws. That position cannot change without financial or  legal consequences until a Bill to reform public authorities is passed by the  Assembly. However, DCAL is assisting FCB staff with bailiff duties, and the  Department has also asked the chairperson of the board to prioritise  outstanding reinstatement work following pollution incidents and to consider  buying in expertise to assist in that work when FCB staff resources are not  sufficient.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Senior departmental officials are meeting the chairperson  and other board members to explore how the Department can provide further  support and assistance to the board during the winding up of the organisation  and the transfer of its functions to the Department to ensure that it continues  to meet audit, governance and  accountability requirements and deliver its statutory functions in  respect of the conservation and protection of salmon and inland fisheries.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the FCB&rsquo;s functions are assumed by the Department, the  current board will be disbanded. It will be essential that, in future,  stakeholders with an interest in fisheries  continue to inform policy. Therefore, I have asked officials to develop  proposals for the setting up of a stakeholder consultation forum. That work is  at an advanced stage.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  Transitional periods are always difficult to administer, but will the Minister  give a commitment to the House that he will regularly report the number of  pollution incidents that take place during  the transition, particularly in respect of Northern Ireland Water? Such  incidents are often made public in response to a question to the Minister. The  main polluter, as we all know, is Northern Ireland Water.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The FCB obviously has a role in tackling pollution, as does the Environment and  Heritage Service. Ultimately, it is the role of both those bodies to ensure  that pollution incidents are minimised and that everyone plays their part in  that effort, including industry, agriculture, and, indeed, Northern Ireland  Water. As the Member is well aware, under the current legislation on the  administration of water, Crown immunity no longer exists, and therefore  Northern Ireland Water can be taken to court for pollution incidents. I am  encouraged that that is the case because, often, others were taken to court  while the Government had immunity, but were the biggest polluter in all  sectors.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I return to the measures that we can take to ensure that  the transfer of responsibilities from the FCB to the Department is effected  smoothly. I asked officials to consider whether we should appoint a  commissioner to oversee the board in the lead-up to its abolition. That  happened during the summer, and I was advised by departmental solicitors that  the Department cannot appoint a commissioner to undertake that work. The  Fisheries Act (Northern    Ireland) 1966, under which the FCB was set  up, does not provide for the appointment of such a commissioner. That is  unlike, for example, the case of the education and library boards, whereby  article 101 of the Education and Libraries (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 does  give such power to the Department.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The structures and functions of the FCB are defined in  legislation, and the Department cannot assume those functions or make permanent  appointments to the FCB. There would be financial and legal consequences were  the Department to assume such a role. For example, people would not be able to  buy licences and could fish illegally without fear of prosecution; income would  be reduced; fish stocks may be seriously depleted; and we could be in breach of  the EU Habitats Directive and the EU Water Framework Directive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Board officers must be appointed by the FCB and approved by  the Department. Solicitors have advised that appointments should be made only  after a process of advertisement, open recruitment and interviews. Therefore, I  have asked representatives of the Department, at their meeting next week with  the chairperson and board members, to discuss how additional support could be  provided to the chief executive and the board until the FCB&rsquo;s functions are  transferred to the Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That work, together with closer oversight and management of  the process by a senior official from my Department &mdash; the chairperson of the  fisheries management group &mdash; will ensure that the conservation and protection  of salmon and inland fisheries will continue to be of paramount importance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department will continue to work with the chairperson  and the chief executive of the FCB to manage the transfer of functions and  minimise the impact on the public and on the fishing community during the  transitional period.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I shall respond to some of the issues that were raised by  Members during the debate. FCB auditors are examining the assets register in  order to verify the existence and whereabouts of boats and will examine their  condition and seaworthiness. The FCB has 19 fisheries officers, three of whom  are on sick leave, and there are 11 active bailiffs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">With respect to the  timing of the transfer of functions</span>, the  Department will act immediately after the legislation is in place.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I touched on the importance of the angling industry at the  outset of my speech. The Department liaises with the Loughs Agency on policies  and requirements for bailiffs, taking cognisance of European legislation such  as the Water Framework Directive, which requires us to work on an all-Ireland  basis in many respects &mdash; which we do already. We have carried out surveys and  consultations in respect of our report on the socio-economic impact of angling,  which we are due to publish in early 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">Departmental staff  attend tourism events in a number</span> of countries each year to advertise  what is available in Northern    Ireland. A new website has received hits  from all over the world.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is prepared to examine the incident that was  mentioned by Mr McCarthy, and I ask him to provide us with the relevant  material.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Financing for the FCB was mentioned. In 2006-07, &pound;200,000  was received from the Environment and Heritage Service. That funding is no  longer available, and has had to be provided by my Department. The total  expenditure for 2006-07 was &pound;948,000, and for 2008-09 it will be &pound;1,055,000.  Despite the fact that we have lost &pound;200,000 of income from the EHS, we will be  able to sustain, and modestly increase above the rate of inflation, the money  available to the FCB.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Members for raising this issue, on which the House  is at one. We recognise the need to manage problems and provide a better  service that is in the best interests of the angling and wider Northern Ireland  community.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am pleased to give the winding-up  speech on the motion and the amendment, because I come from an area where  angling is very important. I would like to mention the Lough Neagh eel  fishermen who have been very unhappy with the service that they have received  from the FCB over the years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">I have already given a  long presentation to the Committee</span> for Culture, Arts and Leisure on that  issue, so I will not go into details. The Lough Neagh Eel Fishermen&rsquo;s  Co-operative Society Ltd issues licences, for which fishermen are glad to pay  because, fundamentally, they own the co-operative. They receive the service  that they want, including the patrolling of the lough. The Fisheries  Conservancy Board should be patrolling the lough but is not doing so  sufficiently or efficiently.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to refer to points that Members made during the  debate. I thank David McNarry for moving the motion. Mr McCausland spoke about  abolishing the board but also keeping stakeholders in touch with everything  that the Assembly is doing so that a body is created that is efficient and that  will stand the test of time in all areas of responsibility. He said that the  board is in crisis; it has lost staff and has financial difficulties, which is  a sign of inefficiency. Morale is low and, as Mr Morrow, said, the organisation  is reaching its sell-by date. My understanding is that it does not have the  confidence of the fishing community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ramsey spoke from a position of strength on Lough Foyle,  which is not dependent on the FCB. He pointed out the importance of tourism. It  was only when I attended a tourism conference a few years ago that I realised,  for the first time, what a huge sport angling is and how important it is to the  economy. I have not been involved in angling, although I live beside the River  Roe, which is one of the best fishing rivers in the North. The economic  argument is powerful, and Mr Ramsey pointed out that angling is worth &euro;55  million to the Republic. I do not have figures for what it is worth here, but  angling attracts huge interest from all over the world, not least because we  are lucky to have rivers that are not only looked after well but are, as far as  is humanly possible, free from pollution. Mr Ramsey also mentioned the  importance of cross-border co-operation. Our rivers do not stop at the border,  and it is vital to have co-operation right round the island for the measures  that are required to maintain this great sport and industry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Kieran McCarthy also spoke about the importance of angling  here and how it must be encouraged by having the best possible body to promote  and protect the fishing environment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ken Robinson complimented the fishermen on the eastern  seaboard. Members may talk about boards, statutory agencies and so forth, but  sports such as fishing and angling depend on the hard work of local fishing  communities, fishing councils and fishermen, who patrol the rivers as they  fish. We should have a vote of thanks for such fishermen, particularly those in  Ken Robinson&rsquo;s area, who have brought the rivers back to full use. For the  first time in many years, salmon have returned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Wallace Browne took an academic line on fishing; he is  obviously a man of some erudition. He reiterated the importance of fishing and  gave his full support to the motion and Members&rsquo; contributions. He mentioned  the need for an overseeing dispensation to replace the FCB, which he described  as having reached its sell-by date. That seems to be the general consensus.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Willie Clarke emphasised the need for the proper resourcing  of whatever body comes into being after the abolition of the FCB. He also  mentioned pollution prevention; what generally happens with pollution is a  damage-limitation exercise after the event. However, it is not difficult to  prevent pollution, and we could examine areas where pollution might happen &mdash; along farm ways or near factories and huge  outlets from housing estates. Many sources of pollution can be monitored  carefully &mdash; and they should be. Pollution should become a part of history. I  agree with Willie <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">Clarke that pollution  prevention must be a priority for the new body.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">P J Bradley supported  Members&rsquo; contributions, based on his local information. The Minister  summed up Members&rsquo; contributions and gave us great hope that the transfer from the FCB to the new body will be  quick and efficient, since much of the preparatory work has already been  done. Like other Members, I support the motion and the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, <span style="font-style:normal; ">That the  amendment be made</span>, put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on  the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to  assist the Fisheries Conservancy Board in its management, and calls on  the Executive to bring forward legislation abolishing the Fisheries Conservancy  Board and transferring its responsibility to  the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure as a matter of urgency.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The next item on the Order Paper  is Question Time for the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety at 2.30 pm. Members may wish to take their ease until then.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenAnswersHeading"><a name="6"></a>Oral Answers to Questions</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading">Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Health Service Efficiency Targets</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr Kennedy </strong>asked the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety to detail the efficiency  targets he has set for the Health Service over the next three years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO625/08>(AQO 625/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: My Department is  finalising challenging efficiencies amounting to &pound;343 million by 2010-11 as  part of the Executive Committee&rsquo;s agreed approach to the comprehensive spending  review. That builds on efficiencies of &pound;146 million that have already been  achieved. Those efficiencies will be  attained through a range of measures, such  as improved procurement, more efficient prescribing and dispensing of  medicines, improved productivity and reduced administration. My officials are  working closely with Health Service professionals to develop detailed plans for  the delivery of those efficiencies. Until I am assured that they are real efficiencies,  and not simply cuts by another name, I will not support specific efficiency  targets for the Health Service.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Will the Minister confirm that in attempting to achieve the 3% efficiency  targets, as he has just outlined, patients will still come first, and that no  cuts will occur at the expense of doctors, nurses and those in the front line  of healthcare?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Patients will always come first; that is why we have a Health Service. The  efficiency targets are very challenging for the Health Service &mdash; some &pound;340  million over three years, in addition to the &pound;146 million that has already been  achieved, which equates to 3% in efficiencies and 5% in areas of  administration. Those are very stiff targets to meet, but I am confident that we can meet them where  productivity, procurement, pharmaceuticals and administrative pay and  related savings are concerned, although it will be difficult and challenging.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Health Service  evolves and changes direction, there  will be a change in emphasis for jobs. For example, care in the  community and looking after patients at home  requires a different type of support and personnel from what is required  in the acute setting, so there are going to be changes. However, the main  concern is always about improving the service for patients.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  Will the Minister assure the House that there will not be any loss of  front-line Health Service jobs due to the efficiency savings?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I refer the Member to the last part of my answer, where I said that I will not  support the efficiencies until I am assured that they are not cuts by another  name. I am not in the business of making cuts. I am in the business of making  efficiencies and making the Health Service work to its absolute optimum in  improved productivity, better buying and efficient prescribing, in order to  support patients. Patient care comes first.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  In light of the efficiency savings that the Minister has outlined, will he tell  the House when he will reach a decision on the review of artwork that he  announced, and the possible savings of around &pound;12 million that could go into  front-line services?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I do not recognise the figure of &pound;12  million, but I did order a review, because under direct rule up to 1% of  the bill for new capital programmes could be spent on artwork. Artwork is a  very broad term; with newbuilds, it could mean softening the environment within  what are very functional buildings and structures &mdash; it is not about buying  pieces of art to hang on the wall.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will come back to the House with the findings of the  review, which I ordered so that I could understand the situation better. The  findings should be available in a reasonably short time.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Clostridium Difficile</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr Hamilton </strong>asked the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety what specific action he is  taking to tackle the high levels of clostridium difficile at the Ulster Hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO621/08>(AQO 621/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>: On 11 September 2007, I announced that, for the first time,  targets to reduce two particular healthcare-associated  infections were being implemented in health and social care trusts in Northern Ireland.  I am seeking a 20% reduction by March 2009 of cases of clostridium difficile in  hospital patients who are aged 65 and over.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A comprehensive  infection-reduction plan for 2007-08 has been produced for the South  Eastern Health and Social Care Trust and is being rolled out at the Ulster Hospital. The infection prevention and control team there  has an active programme, which includes monitoring closely all episodes of  clostridium difficile that occur. That action plan also includes a review of  antibiotic guidelines to ensure that the prudent antimicrobial prescription of  new data that relate to clostridium difficile in the Ulster Hospital during the  second and third quarters of 2007 undergo analysis. Indeed, there are clear  indications that the rate has reduced.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  As the Minister will know, this issue causes great concern throughout our  community. I welcome the targets that he has set to reduce the occurrences of  so-called superbugs. Will he assure me that the method of recording episodes of  clostridium difficile is standardised in all hospitals in Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Yes; it is important that the collection and  sharing of data is standardised throughout all the trusts so that we can  monitor what is happening and that we are comparing like for like. The Member&rsquo;s  point is very important, and I take it on board.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. I am  sure that he is more aware than I am of the difficulty in creating real  accountability in the NHS. Therefore, can he tell the House who is directly  accountable for the quality of cleaning in the Ulster Hospital?  Can he also advise how inspections will be monitored and recorded to ensure  that improvements occur?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I understand that cleanliness is a concern. The Ulster Hospital  has its own infection-reduction plan that  includes a programme that monitors ward cleanliness; monitoring all  multi-antibiotic-resistant bacteria; a medical consultant microbiologist to  provide medical leadership; the introduction of the trust-wide hand-hygiene  campaign; and an active auditing of hand-hygiene practice.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Changing the Culture strategy, which applies throughout  Northern Ireland,  is another important element of the programme. It provides for an audit of environmental-cleanliness standards in hospitals.  There&shy;fore, an implementation group is working to deliver the strategy  and share good practice. Cleaning standards in hospitals are important, and  they cause great concern. As Dr McDonnell is aware, people have a right to expect not to become ill as a result of a visit  to hospital. Therefore, we all need to take the matter seriously.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I thank the Minister for meeting with me recently to discuss infections at the Craigavon Area Hospital.  Does he agree that our hospitals are general thoroughfares where visitors meet  and greet people, and, if so, will he consider reviewing visiting hours to  ensure that every effort is made to crack down on the spread of infections?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  The report from the second audit of environmental-cleanliness standards will be  an important next step in considering areas in which we can ensure that  improvements are made. One such area is regulating visiting and the movement of  the public in hospitals, which are often like public thoroughfares.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A return to some of the  old standards regarding visiting hours and ensuring that only those with  business in the wards should be there is an important function that must be  looked at, and I will certainly do so.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question No 3 has been withdrawn.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Reduced Health Budget</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr McNarry </strong>asked the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety to detail the impact that a reduced budget for his Department will have, in  relation to front-line services and patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO629/08>(AQO 629/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I have not agreed the Budget: I have agreed a draft Budget as a basis for  general consultation with the Assembly and the public. Over the comprehensive  spending review period, the draft Budget will provide an increase of only 1&middot;1%  per annum in real terms for the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety. That represents an increase of &pound;455 million, although the health  budget will increase to over &pound;4&middot;2 billion by  2010-11. Considering that I have unavoidable pressures and existing  commitments of some &pound;700 million for that year, a significant element of my  efficiency savings of &pound;343 million will have to be reinvested to meet those  ongoing pressures. That leaves a mere &pound;16 million to invest in new service  developments next year. By comparison, the Department of Health in England  has seen a larger rise of 3&middot;7%.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. The answer to the question of whether this  is a draft or an adopted Budget is one that the House awaits with great  eagerness, and I await the resolution &mdash; in eight weeks&rsquo; time &mdash; that there is  inadequate funding in all Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that our Health Service needs more  investment, and does he share my disbelief at recent statements from Members  who have claimed that the draft Budget is good for health? Is it not the case  that there would be more money available to invest in our Health Service if  other Members had kept their promises on the delivery of economic packages as a  precondition to entering Government? <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Stop your yapping &mdash; you have been caught on.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Is he allowed to get away with that?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to take her seat. Points of order will not be  taken during Question Time. I am happy to take points of order after Question  Time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  It is clear &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Minister has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. As Members have discussed in the House on several  occasions, our need for mental-health provision is 25% greater than in England and our children&rsquo;s health receives 30%  less funding than it does in England.  There is a gap of over &pound;300 million between our health budget and that of England&rsquo;s,  and that is not disputed by the Department of Finance and Personnel. Over the  next three years, that gap will approximately double to somewhere around &pound;600  million. Therefore, one can see the difference between Northern Ireland and England&rsquo;s health provision. We are  all part of the kingdom and citizens of the same country, but a second-tier  Health Service is being created in Northern   Ireland, and people in Northern Ireland are worse off with  regard to health provision.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  As a member of the Health Committee, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s robust resistance  to taking any cuts in the health budget. As the Minister knows, the Committee  has been receiving submissions on suicide  and self-harm. Considering those submissions and the weekend&rsquo;s tragic events, will the Minister inform the  House if the allocation to mental health &mdash; particularly to resources aimed at  tackling suicide and self-harm &mdash; for this financial year will remain intact.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  As Members are aware, the key document on mental health and learning  disabilities is the Bamford Review of Mental Health and Learning Disability (Northern Ireland) and its findings.  Although there is a roll-out period of between 10 and 15 years for the  implementation of its recommendations, it is important that we get started.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mental health and  learning disability was my number one bid in the review, after  inescapables and conditions that prove fatal. For example, I bid for &pound;17  million for mental health in year one, and the proposed allocation is for &pound;4  million; I bid for &pound;29 million in year two, and the proposed allocation is for  &pound;7 million; and I bid for &pound;48 million in year three, and the proposed  allocation is for &pound;18 million &mdash; a considerable gap.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are major gaps, and I could mention other areas that Members have written to me about. As  regards mental health and learning disability, the most graphic example  is in the area of suicide and self-harm. One can see how difficult it will be  to begin any kind of meaningful roll-out of the Bamford recommendations, and I  find that difficult to accept. The Member is right: I do argue my case as far  as the budget for the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  is concerned.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  have listened to what the Minister has said. However, we all know that the  Minister did agree to the draft Budget at the Executive meeting. Nonetheless,  does he accept that if, as he well knows, the  increasing costs of providing services means that the public purse will not be able to meet public  expectation &mdash; even with allocations as high as 48% of the block grant &mdash;  then it is up to him and his Department to introduce radical reforms to promote  efficiency and offer incentives to service providers. His inaction thus far is  failing the people of Northern    Ireland. Perhaps the Minister &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span><span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Perhaps the Minister will tell the House what cuts he would like to see in  other areas?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Clearly, Mr Ross did not listen to what I said. I said in the first part &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span><span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Shouting at me from a sedentary position says more about Mr  Ross, and his argument, than it does about me and mine.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will repeat what I said. I have not agreed the Budget. I  have agreed a draft Budget as the basis for general consultation with the  Assembly and the general public. Why would I be looking to have a consultation  if the Budget were settled?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Funding and the public purse are related to need, and what  that need is assessed to be. As I pointed out in my answer to the first  question, we have contributed efficiencies worth &pound;143 million so far, and  further efficiencies worth &pound;348 million will be contributed in the next three-year period. Those are major  efficiencies. The issue is not about sectors or employees being  resistant to radical change &mdash; far from it; it is about getting the most  efficient service that we can, because that is what is best for patients and  patient care.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We deal with need, and health is one of those areas in  which need is assessed, and ways are then found to address that need. It is not  about cutting a slice of the cake for health provision and hoping that it will  be enough. If need is not met and catered for properly, lives will be harmed or  even lost.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">New Health Structures</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mrs I  Robinson </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety if  he will provide clarification in relation to the formation of new health  structures, in order to address the concerns of health and social services board employees who are uncertain about their  future employment. <a name=AQO619/08>(AQO 619/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  My key priority is that structural reforms should deliver better outcomes for  the citizens of Northern    Ireland. I inherited proposals that I had no  part in drawing up, and I want to make my  own decisions on the way forward. I wrote to all health and social care  staff on 8 October to let them know in detail what is happening with the change  process and to outline my ambitions for the health and social care system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also wrote to the chairpersons of all boards and trusts  to plan the way ahead and to ensure that work continues as normal. My letters  made it clear that it was very unlikely that there would be any further changes  to structures before April 2009 given the legislative and practical  considerations involved. I also confirmed that the current trust structures &mdash;  the five social care trusts and the Ambulance Service &mdash; will remain largely as  they are.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Given all that has been said thus far, I must take anything that the Minister  says with a large pinch of salt. I have no desire &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will ask my question. The Minister allowed other Members  to speak &mdash; so he can just sit there. I do not wish to make a political football  out of mental-health issues; however, every Executive Minister signed off on  the draft Budget. The Minister is sitting there and is misleading this House &mdash; all Ministers signed off.  Other Executive Ministers are not crying  out like the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety. The reason for that is because he does not have the bottle to take the  necessary decisions that might help the Health Service &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I will ask my question. When will the Minister reduce the number of health boards  from four to one and allow local commissioning groups to do what they are entitled to do? The Minister has  changed those groups&rsquo; positions without consulting them. What will he do  about the local commissioning groups?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I take issue with Mrs Robinson for accusing me of misleading the House. I  repeat &mdash; for the third time: I agreed to the draft Budget as a basis for  consultation with the Assembly. There is no agreement  on the Budget &mdash; nor would there be. Living in denial is an unfortunate  position in which to be.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  The Minister agreed and signed off on the draft Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I did not. I agreed as a basis for consultation.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Minister has the Floor. Allow him to answer.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I realise that Members can become excitable about these  matters. I will explain what is happening with the review of public  administration, because that is, purportedly, what the Member&rsquo;s question was  about. The 19 trusts have been reduced to six. Of those, 18 hospital trusts and the Ambulance Service were  reduced to five plus one. They will largely stay as they are.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Further to that, there are several management functions in  the Health Service that must be examined: performance management is a key  factor in making efficiencies; financial management &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  What about the boards?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Mrs Robinson, I am coming to the boards. Try to show a little patience &mdash;  calmly, calmly, calmly. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> Financial management  is another key management process by which we live within our means and ensure  the maximum possible return on investment. Commissioning is the process by  which services are planned and resourced to ensure that the needs of the  population are met and value for money is achieved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have added two further management functions that were not  previously in the plans devised by Peter Hain and  his direct rule Ministers. Under direct rule, there was a one-day-a-week  Minister, and elected representatives were not allowed on the boards or to be  involved in any Health Service structures. I am considering democratisation,  which would give locally elected representatives a voice in the planning and  delivery of services in the health and social care system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another key function of Health Service management that must  be considered is the potential for the implementation and delivery of health  services at a local level. In other words, transferring powers from the  Department to local government, which would help to take account of existing  health inequalities and the fact that the more disadvantaged the area in which  a person lives, the more likely he or she is to have a shorter life and to suffer from greater rates of morbidity and  mortality, and which could consider action zones and healthy city initiatives.  That is where we are.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Currently, the main management function of the four boards  is that of commissioning. In addition, the shadow commissioning organisations  are in place. Under direct rule, seven local commissioning groups were proposed  to correspond with the seven proposed councils. Most Members understand that  there are unlikely to be seven such councils and that the number of local  commissioning groups will also change.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The boards, about which  Mrs Robinson was shouting at me from a sedentary position, are  undergoing staff reductions, and, until the new structures are in place, their  commissioning role will continue to function.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Does the Minister realise that his  announcement that the restructuring process will continue until 2009 has caused  many staff who work for the health and social services boards huge levels of  stress and anxiety? More inequality and inequity exists, so will he clarify,  for once and for all, what is happening with Agenda for Change? Can the  Minister confirm that health and social services boards&rsquo; staff have been given enough  support? Sinn F&eacute;in believes that they have not.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  As far as Agenda for Change is concerned, matching will be completed by the end  of this year, and the new wage structures will be in place by March 2008. The  process has been under way from long before  I arrived on the scene. I inherited a direct rule plan that had been  drawn up for a direct rule situation. The situation has changed, and it is  important that the Assembly and the  Committee for Health, Social Services  and Public Safety work collectively to determine the best way forward.  Most of the staff changes, which affect the trusts, where the bulk of staff  works, have already been made, and those will not alter much. I am concerned  about efficiencies rather than about any suggestion that we will alter the  structures.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  Given all our concerns about continued improvement in health, and the clearly  unmet needs in the Department, did the Minister not err over the potential  savings that could have been made by retaining the boards?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  The potential saving by April 2009 was &pound;1 million. Although the Department will  not make that saving, it has offset funds to cover it. Therefore, as they  stand, the plans are cost-neutral.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The boards&rsquo; commissioning function will be taken over by  local commissioning groups. However, it is unlikely  that there will still be seven groups, as there are unlikely to be seven councils, so we must examine  how <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">the groups will tie in and what  functions they will assume.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Fewer than 1,000 people work for the boards, and I understand their position. However, they comprise  a small proportion of the total number of Health Service employees, and  I do not want to rush the restructuring &mdash; I want to get it right. Restructuring  has the potential to create real efficiencies, because the Department is  examining performance management, commissioning, financial management, democratisation, and potential for implementation and delivery at local levels, all  of which are functions, as opposed  to structures, of management.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned April 2009, but I hope to announce the proposed  decision in the House long before that. April 2009  is the date that we are looking at for the introduction of legislation.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Home Start</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  Molloy </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety what plans he has to continue the provision of funding, through the Children and  Young People&rsquo;s Fund, for Home Start schemes in Armagh  and Dungannon, in light of the fact that this funding will end in six months.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO611/08> (AQO 611/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I know about the real and lasting differences that locally based Home Start  schemes are making to the lives of families with young children, and I want to be able to continue to support that  important work. However, until the Budget is finalised, funding for individual projects cannot be determined. I  recognise that projects need early confirmation about their future  levels of funding, and I assure those involved that that confirmation will be  forthcoming as soon as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: Does the Minister agree that mainstream funding of such  projects would be better than the stop-start funding that they currently  receive? Given the high number of migrant-worker families in Armagh  and Dungannon, does he agree that the need is greater there?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I agree completely with Mr Molloy&rsquo;s point about stop-start funding. The matter  falls under the remit of the children&rsquo;s fund, which the first Northern Ireland  Executive created in 2001. The children&rsquo;s fund is an Executive programme fund  that the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has delivered.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposal under the draft Budget is that from March  2008, the children&rsquo;s fund will disappear. The Department  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety will therefore have to absorb that funding itself at a cost of &pound;5&middot;9 million per annum. In the present harsh  financial climate, the offer for my Department under the draft Budget is &pound;3&middot;8 million for year one, &pound;2 million  for year two and &pound;2&middot;1 million for year three. That is a major deficit as  far as the children&rsquo;s fund is concerned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore &mdash; and I know that this is no comfort &mdash; it is not  just the main projects that will suffer if the draft Budget goes through. Armagh and Dungannon, Ards, Comber and &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have to interrupt. Unfortunately time is up for the Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading" style="margin-top:1.0cm;"><a name="7"></a>Regional Development</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Road Mortality Hotspots</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  Kennedy </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what action he is  taking to target road mortality hotspots in Northern Ireland; and what plans he  has to deal with these areas in a co-ordinated way. <a name=AQO719/08>(AQO 719/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: I ask for Members&rsquo; indulgence. It is a  wide-ranging question; therefore my answer will be longer than normal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure Members that my  Department&rsquo;s Roads Service and I give a high priority to road safety and  that we are fully committed to making a significant contribution towards  achieving the casualty reduction targets set out in the Northern Ireland road safety  strategy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service receives information from the PSNI on all  collisions in which someone has been injured. The locations of all those  collisions are monitored, and any location with a history of four or more collisions  &mdash; known as a &ldquo;collision cluster&rdquo; &mdash; in a three-year period is investigated to  determine whether appropriate engineering measures could be introduced to  mitigate against further collisions at those sites. Generally speaking, fatal  collisions tend not to cluster together.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Each year, Roads Service implements programmes of collision  remedial schemes across the North. Considerable success has been demonstrated  with that approach, with a reduction of over 50% of target collisions at  treated sites. The most recent assessment has shown that Roads Service has  achieved an overall reduction of 68% of target collisions at treated sites over  three years following the completion of the collision remedial schemes  implemented during the 2003-04 financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the collision  remedial programme has progressed, the majority of the collision cluster  sites have been treated, which has resulted in collisions being more dispersed  on the road network and occurring in a more random fashion. In that instance,  the length of road can be considered for what is known as &ldquo;route treatment&rdquo;,  which involves the assessment of entire lengths of roads to determine what  measures are necessary to improve their overall safety records.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In July 2007, I had a  successful meeting with Minister Foster and Assistant Chief Constable  Toner to discuss how all of us can contribute to the forthcoming review of the Northern Ireland  road safety strategy. Members will be aware  that that strategy was developed to promote an integrated approach to  the planning, co-ordination and delivery of  the Government&rsquo;s road-safety activities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service, the Department of the Environment and the PSNI work in a co-ordinated manner to  promote road safety across the North, through road-safety engineering,  enforcement and education measures. We all  give road safety a high priority and are fully committed to making a  contribution towards reducing the carnage on the roads.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The implementation of the road safety strategy has  undoubtedly contributed significantly to the substantial reduction in overall  injury collisions since 2000. However, so far this year, 88 people have  tragically lost their lives on our roads.  Although that figure is down on the  same period last year, we must not be complacent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The level of motorcycle fatalities &mdash; 24 riders and one  pillion passenger &mdash; so far this year is a major concern, and addressing that  statistic is a key priority for everyone involved in road safety.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, driving at excessive speed without regard to  conditions is one of the major causation factors of collisions on our roads. I  will shortly be considering the review of the speed management policy, which  was carried out by my officials in conjunction with the PSNI and the DOE&rsquo;s road  safety branch. I hope that officials will be in a position to discuss that  review with the Committee for Regional Development by the end of the year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Engineering, enforcement and education all have a vital role to play in reducing road casualties in  the North. However, it is a well established fact that the vast majority of collisions are due to driver error.  Therefore, road users also have to play their part in reducing road  casualties. Drivers and riders must, at all times, drive at the appropriate  speed for the prevailing conditions and pay attention to all of the hazards  that contribute to the carnage on our roads.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Minister for his concise answer. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span><span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On a serious note, I  thank him for his comprehensive answer. As road conditions clearly have  an impact on traffic accidents, will the Minister detail how often resurfacing  of main roads and trunk roads takes place, and whether the time frames for  resurfacing are improving?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: If the Member wants a concise answer, he should perhaps ask a  concise question.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Road maintenance is, of course, important to DRD Roads  Service in helping to maintain safety on all of our roads.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I draw the Member&rsquo;s attention to statistics that have consistently indicated over the years that 81% of  accidents are due to driver behaviour. Only 2% of accidents are  attributed to road conditions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Road safety is of key  importance in my Department&rsquo;s structure and maintenance budget, and  remedial work is carried out along the routes where accident clusters occur.  However, the overwhelming proportion of road fatalities  is caused by driver behaviour. My Department will continue to invest in  addressing road conditions as far as its budget allows, and will bid for the  maximum possible budget for such investment to enhance road safety. However,  road condition is not the major factor that causes fatalities on our roads.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  Given the concern of all Members about road deaths, particularly in  cross-border regions, will the Minister outline what procedures are in place to  ensure that relatives are fully informed as to the causes of road fatalities?  He has already mentioned driver behaviour as a cause of fatalities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister  inform the House how the collation of information on road deaths is used  in publicity campaigns that are designed to reduce deaths on the roads?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Some elements of the Member&rsquo;s question relate to responsibilities of the  Department of the Environment. My Department is responsible for roads: their structures, surfaces and conditions.  However, informing relatives of the causes of accidents, and the use of statistics in publicity campaigns, are  responsibilities of the Department of  the Environment. That Department is responsible for road-safety  campaigns.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I have explained,  police inform the Roads Service of accidents that have caused an injury,  and if a pattern emerges at a certain spot,  it is deemed a collision cluster. The Roads Service will take remedial  action at that spot or along the route where it lies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the other matters that the Member has queried,  which relate specifically to road safety, are the responsibility of the  Department of the Environment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Mine is a precise question. Does the Minister agree that the Frosses Road &mdash; the  A26 &mdash; is a mortality hot spot and urgently  requires upgrading to a dual carriageway, considering the number of  tragic deaths on that stretch of road? Will he give a timescale for that work?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  The Member and others have been in touch with me on a number of occasions about  the Frosses Road.  There is a programme of work, but I have no precise timescale to hand. However,  that information has been communicated in responses to written questions and in  letters to Members from that general area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I have just received a note that states that &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No; I am sorry: that  note relates to a different question altogether. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There have been fatalities on the Frosses Road, and local people and  elected representatives are concerned that remedial action be taken.

	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Elliott </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to give his assessment  of the impact on the financial models upon which the proposals of the strand one report of the Independent Water Review  Panel are based, if increased  affordability tariffs are proposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO657/08>(AQO  657/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Any assessment of the financial impact of an improved affordability tariff is  subject to the independent panel&rsquo;s further  recommendations under strand two of its review. However, my Department&rsquo;s  preliminary assessment suggests that that could cost &pound;6 million per annum.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Independent Water Review Panel&rsquo;s strand-one report made  two main points about the affordability tariff. It suggested that the proposed  arrangements were efficient at helping those who qualified: in other words, the  tariff lifted out of water poverty almost all those who qualified for it.  However, it did not appear to adequately target working families on low incomes  or pensioners who were not entitled to benefits or who failed to claim them. Consequently,  the panel has undertaken to do more work on  that matter, with a view to making  further recommendations in its second report.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>: I thank the Minister for his answer. Under what he calls the  current preliminary assessment, will he assure the House that, after 2009,  household rates bills will not be increased  as a result of the introduction of the water tax?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  The Member should know that the issue of  household rates bills is the responsibility of the Department of Finance  and Personnel. My Department has set out clearly that more work will be done on  the costs that will be incurred over the next couple of years or so in the  second report of the Independent Water Review Panel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I made a statement to the Assembly on 22 October, for which  I had the approval of the Executive. Then, the Minister of Finance and  Personnel, as part of his Budget statement, said that there would be no  increase in the regional rate. There had been some expectation that the  regional rate might be hiked to meet the cost of attributing some of the money  towards the cost of water, as had been the case traditionally. I assure the  Member that we will continue to look closely at the matter. The financial  impact over the next number of years for the Executive and the general public  has been set out in my statement and in the Budget statement.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. As regards affordability tariffs and those people who  would be unable to make a one-off payment, has water metering been considered?  How much difference would there be between one-off payments and metering?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Domestic metering was dealt with in the panel&rsquo;s report, and it is a subject on  which there will continue to be diverse views. It should be obvious that  metering will not make everyone&rsquo;s bill more affordable. Although certain  households with low consumption would see a reduction in their Bills, others  would have to increase. On 22 October, in response to questions following my  statement in the Assembly, I expressed my view that it would be appropriate to  have a debate in the coming weeks and months  about what the benefits of metering are presumed to be. Such a debate will shed more light on the subject, as there has not been a proper debate on metering.  I know that other people have very firm views on the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In response to the second part of the panel&rsquo;s report and  the related consultation, in order to move forward, debate &mdash; and perhaps  legislation for the Assembly to vote on &mdash; will be required.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: Does the Minister accept that the proposed water charges &mdash; and public confidence in them &mdash;  will stand or fall on the basis of  the affordability tariff? Will he assure the House that he has already  discussed the issue with the review panel and has outlined his suggestions in  order to ensure that any form of water charging is fair, seen to be fair, and  will have public confidence?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Public confidence has already been increased as a result of how the debate has  been conducted. In retrospect, there was a great lack of confidence in how the  previous Administration and the direct rule Administration dealt with some of  the issues. The current Administration has succeeded through the good work  carried out by the panel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member knows that some panel members have a significant  knowledge of affordability and water poverty issues. At the start, I gave them  my general view on the issues. It is not appropriate for me to suggest to the  panel how it might deal with those issues. The panel is independent of the  Executive, and its recommendations will be  considered by the Executive and the Assembly. I assure the Member that I  share his view that affordability is one of the key elements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People should not be made to suffer or to fall into water  poverty as a result of our propositions. The Executive&rsquo;s overriding objective,  despite the poisoned commentary that I heard  over the weekend, is to provide the fairest possible system within the  constraints facing us and to provide a transparent system so that people can  understand clearly what they are being asked to pay for and the service they  will receive as a result. The proposals that we brought forward, and that the Executive agreed, set us on our way, and I look  forward to the second phase of the panel&rsquo;s report, which will bring more  light to the issue of affordability. I share with the Member and many others  the view that affordability is a key issue.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">New Homes</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what plans he has to  compel developers to pay the full cost of  connecting new homes to services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO701/08> (AQO  701/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Connecting all new homes to services involves the cost of making a connection  to the water main or public sewer and the cost of ensuring that the local  network has the capacity to meet the increased demand placed upon it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those costs are  recovered through connection charges and the new infrastructure charges  that have been introduced, on a phased  basis, this year. For a relatively small number of properties there is  also the cost for providing a water main or for sewer extension requisitioning. For that work the water company  provides a reasonable cost allowance to the developer. The arrangement is intended to fairly apportion  the costs of a requisition between  the developer and the company.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In its strand one report, the independent panel recommends  that that should be reviewed, and it is my intention to initiate that review  shortly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>: Recently, most developers have made huge amounts of money by  building new developments and apartments, some of which are required and some  that are not.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, all of those developments need sewer and water  pipes, new street lighting and, sometimes, new roads, for which the taxpayer is  usually obliged to pay. Does the Minister not agree that it is ridiculous that  taxpayers must, effectively, subsidise the business interests of some of the  wealthiest people in society?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  assure the Member that, in line with the panel&rsquo;s recommendation, I intend to  review that situation. However, last year&rsquo;s consultation document indicated  that the annual cost of requisitions &mdash; the connection charges to which the  Member refers &mdash; was around &pound;7 million, half of which was borne by the  developers under proposals that were introduced by the direct rule Administration and the other half by the water  company. More recent data from the current financial year suggests that those  figures may have been overestimates. Clearly, the issue must be examined  further. The Department intends to review the contribution that is made by  developers.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Developers are currently required to bring the infrastructure in their  developments up to adoption standards before they are handed over to Roads  Service. In many cases, developments have been completed for five, six or,  sometimes, seven years before the roads are brought up to standard, which  causes great problems for residents. What plans does the Minister have for  early activation of the bonds that developers must take out, so that people do  not have to wait for years before the roads in the developments in which they  live are brought up to proper standards?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  accept entirely what the Member has said. Several Members have written to me or  submitted questions on the matter. I understand the frustration of people who  live in such developments. Obviously, the onus is on the developer to bring  roads, footpaths and other infrastructure  up to an acceptable standard. Roads Service  cannot adopt them until that happens. However, as a situation drags on,  the question is at what stage Roads Service should take the bond and carry out  the work itself. Roads Service must consider the cost of the work and whether  it can take on a planned schedule of work in a particular area given the  tightness of the schedule elsewhere. I am happy to consider the issue and to  discuss it with Roads Service. I am aware that it is a source of frustration  that has been raised by many Members right across the North. On the Member&rsquo;s  suggestion, I am content to sit down with Roads Service senior management and  discuss how progress can be made.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: Will the Minister ensure that any changes to connection charges  do not add to the cost of social housing and that there will be provision for  first-time buyers?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  am not sure how the Member makes that relation. Kieran McCarthy&rsquo;s proposition  is that any changes to connection costs should be borne by the developer. I do  not see how that would add to the costs of social housing. Perhaps, the Member  refers to affordable housing or social housing that is built by developers.  That is fair enough. Had he said that at the outset, his question would have  been clearer. The amount that a developer charges for a house and what he or  she receives is a matter for the buyer in that particular market.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The panel has suggested that a review be initiated, and  people have made the case that developers are receiving a substantial amount of  money for the properties that they develop.  Therefore, the Department has suggested that, if there is scope for an  increase or reconsideration of the cost of connection in such a way that it  will not affect public funds or the money that would otherwise be spent by the  water company, which is received from the general public, it is quite happy to  carry out a review of the matter.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Water Bills</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr B  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development for his assessment of  the impact that future revaluations of domestic rating will have on the newly  proposed water bills.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO646/08>(AQO 646/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  The level of water and sewerage bills under a capital-value-based regime  depends on two factors that are independent of each other; first, the cost of  providing the services, and, secondly, the capital value of an individual  property as a proportion of the aggregate capital value of all properties. The  effect of a revaluation depends on a change in the proportion rather than in  the actual capital value. Although it is impossible to predict the effects of a  revaluation on water and sewerage bills at  an individual level, some properties increase in value more rapidly than  others for a variety of reasons. It is important to keep in mind that the  individual capital values are used as a means to distribute the total cost of  providing the service across all customers. It is my assessment that, provided  that revaluations are carried out at frequent intervals, their impact on water  and sewerage bills will generally be small.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  As the water tax proposed by the Department for Regional Development will be  based on capital value, will the Minister tell us how that will affect social  housing tenants who &mdash; obviously &mdash; do not own their own houses?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  dispute the Member&rsquo;s description of the charges as a &ldquo;water tax&rdquo;. That assumes  that a progressive tax is being imposed on people rather than a charge for  service provision. I understand where, perhaps, the Member has got the idea of  a water tax, because he is a member of the same party as the previous First  Minister. It was something that was hatched in the plans that that First  Minister had with the Treasury.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The contribution made by households will be subject to  affordability tariff discussions in the second part of the panel&rsquo;s review. The  intention of the system &mdash; as I have said to another colleague &mdash; is to have the  fairest and most transparent system possible. That is a marked difference from  the system that was proposed by the Member&rsquo;s former party leader. It is  certainly a marked difference from the system that was proposed by direct rule  Ministers. It is our intention that the system will be fair and transparent,  and that those who can least afford to pay will be the people who are asked for  the least payment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  When a revaluation happens, will the Minister explain how he will ensure that  it will be made clear that an opportunity has not been taken to increase the  water component of a domestic charge? There is widespread misunderstanding  about the issue of charges, and people take it for granted that, in the event  of a revaluation, their bills will simultaneously increase in the same way.  What is the Minister doing &mdash; and what is he doing in conjunction with the  Minister of Finance and Personnel &mdash; to contribute to more public understanding  about that issue?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  am happy to contribute to answering your question. We will have a debate  tomorrow when &mdash; if that question arises &mdash; I will be happy to address it. The  question reveals a certain misunderstanding. The contribution made from  domestic and non-domestic customers will pay for water and sewerage services &mdash;  whatever those services may cost. If there is  a hike in the value of property, that does not necessarily mean that  there will be a hike, to the same level, in water and sewerage bills.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Charges are not based on the value of a house. Rather,  charges are based on the cost of the services to people across the region.  Therefore, the domestic or non-domestic customer can be charged only for that  which is needed to ensure provision of water and sewerage services. There is a  misconception in that people think that charges are linked to the value of  property, and, as the value of property increases, so do the bills. Bills, and the contributions for which  domestic or non-domestic customers are asked, will pay for service  provision. That will be made apparent. That is where the system&rsquo;s transparency and fairness is a marked improvement on the system that was formerly  proposed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. What evidence is there for the following statement in the  Independent Water Review Panel&rsquo;s &lsquo;Strand One Report&rsquo;:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;&bull; Capital value is a broadly acceptable proxy for  ability to pay&rdquo;,</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">especially for those who are asset-rich and  income-poor? Will the Minister confirm that all his colleagues in the Executive  backed and supported the findings of the  panel? Will the Minister recommend to his Executive colleagues that they should inform their party  colleagues about ministerial decisions that they have taken in Executive  Committee meetings?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Order, order. Please allow the Minister to answer.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: The  truth is often difficult to face. The first  part of the Member&rsquo;s question should be addressed by the panel, because it brought forward the work.  Most unmeasured regimes are based on property values, in one form or  another. In Scotland,  for example, water charges are based on council tax bands and command a fair  degree of acceptance. Earlier work that was undertaken by my Department a  number of years ago suggests that, in general terms, a capital value system directs higher charges to more affluent areas of  the North.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to Ms Anderson&rsquo;s second question, the Executive  agreed a way forward on the decisions that needed to be taken for the budgetary  discussions, decisions and statements that  were made. That received unanimous  support in the Executive. The Executive, and my colleagues in the Executive subcommittee, will wish to discuss  further a number of other recommendations made by the panel. I was pleased that  the Executive decided the general way forward on how the panel&rsquo;s report  impacted on the budgetary decisions that had to be taken.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 5 has been withdrawn.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Roads Service Budget</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr A  Maginness </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what funding bid he  had submitted in relation to structural maintenance in the Roads Service  budget. <a name=AQO681/08>(AQO 681/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  The House heard the statement on the October monitoring round this morning, and  we have not secured any money in that round for structural maintenance. We  submitted bids totalling &pound;22 million as part of that round. The bids submitted  in the current comprehensive spending review have been in line with the Roads  Service structural maintenance funding plan, and they amount to &pound;323 million  over the three-year CSR period.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  It is disappointing that the Minister&rsquo;s bid in the October monitoring round has  not secured additional funding. The amount of money that he mentioned &mdash; &pound;323  million over three years &mdash; is clearly not adequate to meet the real structural  maintenance demands. The likely consequence of the inadequate funding that the  Minister has allowed himself to receive is that although major roads may be  attended to, minor roads and drainage systems will not.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  share the Member&rsquo;s disappointment. He will know from his former position as the  Chairperson of the Regional Development Committee that structural maintenance  often does not receive the allocations that the Roads Service would hope for.  However, as the monitoring rounds continue, there is a tendency to make up that  shortfall. Members will be aware &mdash; particularly from this morning&rsquo;s discussion  on the statement by the Minister of Finance and Personnel &mdash; that the December monitoring round often offers the most potential for securing additional  funding. We will continue to push the case for such funding, and we are  very much aware of our responsibilities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not the case that the larger roads are prioritised  and smaller roads neglected. We try to make available as much  structural-maintenance funding as possible across all the Roads Service  divisions. Those divisions try to spend that money as best they can, according  to their own priorities. We will continue to push the case for more structural  maintenance funding, as the Department has normally been successful in securing  additional funding when it becomes available in the later monitoring rounds.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Like the Member for North Belfast Mr Maginness, I too am disappointed that the  funding available for structural maintenance is nowhere near adequate. I  represent the rural constituency of Mid Ulster, where money is tight, to say  the least. Can the Minister assure me that when any future moneys are being  made available, such areas will be given a fair share of that funding? It  certainly seems that rural areas get the  lesser amounts of money, given the figures for city routes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  assure the Member that whatever moneys are made available will be distributed  fairly. Like the Member, I represent a rural constituency that would certainly  consider itself to have been neglected over many years in respect of  infrastructural funding. Many border constituencies would consider that they  have likewise been neglected.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, there is a formula for distributing the money  across the various Roads Service divisions. It distributes the money as fairly  as possible, and I will ensure that that fairness persists. As I said in  response to the previous question, we will always continue to argue for the  maximum amount of money for the structural maintenance budget, not just during  the budgetary discussions at the start of the year, but during the monitoring  rounds and whenever any money becomes available throughout the year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  I am sure that the Minister is aware of the statistics that emerged in the  Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s 2000  report on the state of our roads. On some 17% of our roads,  anti-skidding standards were below the required threshold. Are the present  standards on trunk roads throughout the Province higher or lower than that 17%?  If they are lower, what are the Minister and his Department doing about it?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  The current standards are lower, but it depends on whether the Member considers  those standards to be absolute prerequisites for road safety. They are lower  than the expected standard, but less money is available to spend compared with  what is available for other areas. However, we will continue to argue that road  safety is a key factor of the roads maintenance budget, and we will try to  spend money according to our priorities. I am aware of the statistics that the  Member quoted, but the overwhelming cause of road fatalities and injuries is  driver behaviour rather than the surface or structure of the road.  Nevertheless, we will continue to treat road safety as a priority and, where  the money is available, invest in it.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Sewage Treatment Facilities</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr Beggs </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development for his assessment of whether  or not the current sewage treatment facilities at Whitehead and Ballystrudder  met the standards required under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive; and  to give a timescale within which proposals to upgrade sewage treatment  facilities at these locations would be implemented.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO685/08> (AQO 685/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: Responsibility for determining whether waste-water treatment  facilities meet the appropriate treatment requirements of the EU urban  waste-water treatment directive rests with the Department of the Environment&rsquo;s  Environment and Heritage Service, which has determined that appropriate  treatment facilities are not in place in either Ballystrudder or Whitehead. I  have been advised by Northern Ireland Water that an option to combine flows  from Ballycarry, Ballystrudder and Whitehead for discharge &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: I apologise for interrupting. The time for questions to the Minister for Regional Development  is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I will respond in writing to the Member.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  We now move to questions to the Minister for Social Development. I call Mr  Danny Kennedy again.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="8"></a>Social Development</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">House Prices</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  Kennedy </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for her assessment of the  impact of the recent cooling of house prices on the affordable homes situation  in Northern Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO709/08> (AQO 709/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have had three firsts. I wonder what that would mean  for an accumulator in the bookies. I will never know.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: Sir John Semple&rsquo;s review and report on  affordable housing were undertaken at a time when the housing market in Northern Ireland  was extraordinarily buoyant, with very high price increases and with growth in  the price of land outstripping that of houses. Nonetheless, the market never  stays the same, and future adjustment to a less buoyant market seems  inevitable. If recent media reports are to be believed, prices seem to be steadying, and, in some cases, dropping. I hope  that the market is calming, but we have yet to get concrete evidence that that  is happening across the board, and not just in pockets. The panel of experts  that I set up for the purpose will address those issues, and I look forward to receiving its report.  Coincidentally, I will meet with the chairperson of that panel later  this week, and I will raise those issues with him.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the meantime,  affordability and housing investment will remain priorities for me. I am  keen to identify and explore all options, in order to allow my Department to  fulfil its housing and regeneration responsibilities over the next three years,  notwithstanding the Budget and investment  strategy limitations. To that end, my officials are engaging with  Baroness Ford of Cunninghame, chairman of English Partnerships, to gain  information and advice on how such  challenges, including legislative implications, have been successfully  addressed in Great Britain  and Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is anticipated that the relevant information will cover  the three areas of land, subsidy and planning. Baroness Ford has already  commenced her work for me in that regard. It is necessary that that assignment  is cognisant of, and dovetails with, the  work of the capital realisation task force, and that emerging findings  are available sufficiently quickly to inform the outcome of the final Programme  for Government and Budget settlement, which, as Members know, are anticipated  in January 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Again, I thank the Minister for a concise answer. It must be my questions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">How will the recent announcement in the draft Programme for  Government of 10,000 new social homes in the next few years affect the demand  for affordable homes? Will the Minister confirm whether she has access to any  other funding streams to assist her in achieving her objective?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  The target set by the draft Programme for Government is for 10,000 houses over  the next five years. The funds that I have received in the draft Budget are  inadequate if we are to meet that target, because it will provide for only 300  houses in the coming year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, as a result of the capital-realisation task-force  initiative, social housing has been factored into the Investment Strategy for Northern Ireland  as a priority for capital receipt. My Executive colleagues and I must be more  innovative and creative about accessing funding from the private sector. I will  consider alternative funding-investment models for the provision of social  housing, such as: alternative methods of borrowing; private finance; land  sales; and developer contributions. In that respect, I will meet with my  ministerial colleague Minister Foster next week to discuss article 40 of the  Planning (Northern Ireland)  Order 1991 and the provision of social housing in the context of mixed-tenure  development. I am sure that the Member will agree that the whole purpose of the  exercise is to increase the supply of social housing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All that will take time to deliver, but none of us must  lose sight of the fact that a cost is associated with servicing borrowing and  with private finance. Similar to a mortgage, that borrowing must be repaid with  interest. Notwithstanding all that, I am charged with addressing the needs of  the 36,000 people who are on the social-housing waiting list, around half of  whom are in urgent housing need. There are around 21,000 homeless people.  Housing is the challenge that faces everyone in the House.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The Minister said  that the affordable-homes situation has been factored into the investment  strategy, and she talked about the impact that the cooling of house prices has  had. Can she explain the impact that that will have on the social-housing  waiting list, which she said comprises around 36,000 people?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  When the Executive discussed the investment strategy for Northern Ireland,  I sought &mdash; and was given &mdash; an assurance from the Minister of Finance and  Personnel that social housing would be a priority from the return on capital  receipts along with schools and education. That will all come about from the  probable successful outcome of the capital realisation task force. I am  conscious, as the Assembly and Executive must be, of the high number of people  who are in urgent need of housing, the high number of people who are homeless,  and the fact that the current Budget, if implemented, would not deal adequately  with addressing the decent homes standard, or with dealing with maintenance and  fuel poverty. It is incumbent on us all to ensure that we lobby for a  sufficient Budget and to ensure that social housing is given the priority that  is being afforded to it in the Investment Strategy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I am sure that it gives the Minister no pleasure to preside over a housing  crisis, albeit one that is not of her creation. However, she is now charged  with the responsibility of taking us out of that housing crisis. Will she  consider thinking outside the box about the future for social-sector housing?  Has she explored all options? Did she say that 36,000 people are on the waiting  list for social housing and that there are 35,000 vacant homes in Northern Ireland?  Surely it is time to tackle the issue of vacant homes: to date the Housing  Executive has not given that the necessary consideration. Will the Minister  also undertake to re-examine the delivery of social-sector housing, and in  particular, examine the roles of the Housing Executive and housing  associations?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  In May 2007, I told the House that I had instructed the Executive to implement  an empty- homes strategy, which was one of  the recommendations of the Semple Report. At that time, I was told that  there were 40,000 empty homes in Northern Ireland, of which around  5,000 were in the social-housing sector and which belonged to the Housing  Executive and housing associations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In July, I received an  interim report, which identified about 5,000 houses that could be  improved at a reasonable cost and returned to that sector. Last week, when I  met the chairperson, the chief executive and board members of the Housing  Executive, they promised that I would receive a further report, which I hope to get this week. I impressed on them that I  needed the report as quickly as possible, because some void houses could  be improved and made ready for use. People could subsequently be allocated  suitable houses in their area of choice.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Girdwood Site</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Dr Farry </strong>asked the Minister for Social  Development to make a statement on the future of the Girdwood site.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO721/08>(AQO 721/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  The Girdwood site will be developed as part  of a wider area that includes the former Crumlin<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> Road</span> jail. The regeneration and redevelopment of that  combined site is progressing on the basis of an integrated master plan. As  Members will be aware, on 16 October 2007, I announced a period of public  consultation on the draft master plan for the site, which is due to end on 22  January 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been considerable speculation about the site&rsquo;s  potential to accommodate social housing. I assure Members that the draft master  plan simply illustrates how the site might be developed. I am conscious of the  Government&rsquo;s commitment to a shared future for all the people of Northern Ireland.  In that strategic context, I hope that the site will be developed as a place  where everyone can live, work and socialise.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I thank the Minister for her comprehensive answer. I want to  focus on social housing and, in particular, a shared future. The Minister is  aware that some people, bizarrely, argue that the goal of a shared future is a  reason for not having social housing on that site. Will the Minister assure the  House that there is no contradiction between the provision of social housing on  the land and the promotion of good relations?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sticking to the shared-future agenda, what steps will she  take to ensure that the land is open to residents from all sections of the  community and will remain so in the future?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  The &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Allow the Minister to answer the question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I am acutely aware of the shortage, problems and crises in housing in north Belfast. I have no doubt  that the site has the potential to meet some of the pressing housing needs  there. Indeed, the advice from the master plan consultants is that new housing  of mixed tenure is a vital component of the site&rsquo;s regeneration. I am strongly  compelled by the need for shared housing, investment opportunities and  recreational space on that site, because the needs and requirements of the  people of north Belfast  must be catered for.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>:  Will the Minister tell the House how much progress she has made in discussions  with the local communities about housing on  the Girdwood site?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  Mr Cobain was a member of the Committee that discussed the master plan and was  aware of all its work before I announced the plan for the draft consultation.  He also knew about some of the problems that arose. I met the Member last week  to discuss a particular housing issue in north Belfast, and I know that there are extremely  long waiting lists for housing in certain communities there. I am determined  that all Members of the House reach an adequate solution to the housing crisis  that has been happening for years. It is an urgent issue that requires a  cross-departmental resolution from me and all members of the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s answer. Her  recognition of the high level of need for social housing in north Belfast is to be  commended.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest as a former member of the Girdwood  advisory panel; I attended many of its meetings.  I am aware of the concerns in the community. However, will the Minister  reaffirm that a mix of social and affordable housing will meet the objective  need of those on the housing waiting list, and that the accommodation needs of  key workers around the site will be factored in, where possible?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  When I launched the draft master plan, and even prior to that, I had several  meetings with political representatives who are members of the steering group  to take forward the plan for the Girdwood and Crumlin Road site. We must promote  equality, we must address the housing needs and the acute housing crisis that  has been endemic in north Belfast  for several years, and we must deploy a caring, compassionate attitude to it. I  am sure that everyone will invest their consultations and their work in it. I  look forward to working with all parties in respect of that. There must be a  shared, equal approach to the provision of housing on that site.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her reassurance that social housing will be a top  objective in the plan for the Girdwood site, given the grave and chronic  housing shortage in north Belfast.  This is an opportunity for people &mdash; not a  threat to any community &mdash; to develop the site in the interests of all  the people of north Belfast,  Catholic and Protestant. No one has anything to fear from the full,  comprehensive development of that windfall  site. I urge the Minister to continue  her work to provide leadership in that direction.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I agree with the Member that the Crumlin    Road and Girdwood site provides an opportunity for  all the people of Belfast.  That is why, on 16 October, I urged all the residents of north Belfast, including those with an economic  interest, whether they owned a retail establishment or had investment  opportunities or wanted to invest, to make a contribution to the consultation  process. I also urge all public representatives, from MPs to MLAs and  councillors in north Belfast,  to make a contribution to the consultation process. No one has anything to fear  from a fully comprehensive development on that site, to include affordable  housing, social housing, development opportunities and recreational space. We  must look forward, and we must provide for the needs of the current generation  and of future generations if we are to resolve the housing and investment  problems and to provide a better way of life for everyone in the constituency  of North Belfast.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Semple Review</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr Burns </strong>asked the Minister for Social Develop&shy;ment  to outline the funding bid she has made to meet the recommendations of  the Semple Review.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO668/08> (AQO 668/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Newbuild Housing Plan</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Butler </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development to detail what alternative  plans her Department has developed as a contingency, if it is not fully successful in its bid for &pound;1.1 billion for a  new build housing plan, in light of the current budget restraints and  the ongoing Comprehensive Spending Review.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO693/08> (AQO  693/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Newbuild Social and Affordable Housing</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">14. <strong>Mr  Sammy Wilson </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what action she is  taking to ensure that there is an adequate provision of affordable and social  housing in Northern Ireland.&nbsp;<a name=AQO609/08> (AQO 609/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will answer questions 3, 4 and 14 together,  in the light of the similarities between them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A bid for &pound;2&middot;173 billion, which includes receipts from  house and land sales, has been made available to the investment strategy for  Northern Ireland (ISNI 2) for the social-housing development programme to  provide 2,000 new houses each year, as recommended in the Semple Report, over  the next 10 years. In case the bid is not fully successful, methods to increase  the supply of homes in the new  social-housing development programme  are under consideration and are being evaluated. However, it may take time to  realise the benefits of those alternative methods. We intend to maximise the  developer contributions provided for in article 40 of the Planning (Northern Ireland)  Order 1991, and my officials are working with their colleagues in DOE and DRD  to advance that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Next week, I shall meet my ministerial colleague Arlene  Foster, the Minister of the Environment, to consider ways in which we can speed  up the introduction of article 40 developer contributions. Several Members from  all sides of the Chamber have discussed that issue with me, because we are all  aware of the need to increase the supply of social housing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, we are examining an aggressive sale of Housing  Executive land to bring in much-needed capital  finance. I am looking to the capital realisations taskforce, which was  established under the auspices of the Strategic Investment Board, for a  guarantee that the full receipts for the sale of any surplus lands that belong  to the Department for Social Development or the Housing Executive will be  retained by the Department for allocation to the housing budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge the &pound;20 million that has been given to the  Department as part of the October monitoring round. That will give a  much-needed lift by providing for approximately 200 starts in the social-housing  development programme, and although I am  disappointed that that will not allow me to reach the target of 1,500  new starts, it will still allow approximately 1,100 starts during this  financial year. I will continue to make representations in further monitoring  rounds to secure additional finances, because as everyone in Northern Ireland,  the Assembly and the Executive knows, social housing should be a number-one  priority.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am very keen to progress the Semple recommendations on  affordability, but unfortunately his work did not include any cost-benefit  analysis of any of the report&rsquo;s 80 recommendations. I must ensure that the  implementation of those recommendations will assist us in providing affordable  housing &mdash; roofs over people&rsquo;s heads &mdash; and that they provide the best  opportunity, the timeliest mechanism and value for money in delivering that  objective.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department also funds the co-ownership scheme, which is  aimed at providing those on low incomes who would not be eligible for a full  mortgage to become homeowners on an equity-sharing, part-mortgage, part-rent  basis.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her answer. Bearing in mind that Northern Ireland  is facing a housing crisis, does the Minister agree that the large banks of  land that the Housing Executive holds could be sold off to fund social housing?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I agree with the Member that there is a housing crisis, but it is not of the  Assembly&rsquo;s making, because Northern    Ireland inherited a woefully inadequate  budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Notwithstanding that, we must examine all possible measures  to increase the amount of money that is available to the Department in order to  deal with the social-housing crisis. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive  holds an extensive land bank, which it has built up in anticipation of current  and future housing development. In the past three years, land and houses to the  value of more than &pound;400 million have been sold to facilitate a number of  capital programmes, and this year we are planning for lands and house sales  amounting to &pound;140 million. Over the next three years, I will require the  Housing Executive to sell surplus land and housing to the value of &pound;475 million  through the house sales scheme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Housing Executive&rsquo;s current land bank and housing stock  has a significant value, but it also creates a significant opportunity for  social and economic development, because  housing is central to regeneration and improving people&rsquo;s lives. The  portfolios of land and buildings are managed and reviewed regularly, and  opportunities for disposal are considered. The Housing Executive has  approximately 300 primary sites that are ready for development or earmarked for  development in the near future.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The Minister quoted a figure of &pound;20 million  for 200 new starts, which equates to &pound;100,000 per house. Is that correct?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  As I said, I have received &pound;20 million in the October monitoring round, which  will enable 200 new starts and will allow further work to be done in the Northern Ireland  co-ownership scheme.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  The Minister has talked about sale of land and developer contributions in  funding new housing, although this is coming at a time when developers are  going to be less likely to make contributions than they were two or three years  ago. However, she has not mentioned the considerable cash assets that are lying  in the bank accounts of housing associations. Those assets could release up to  &pound;120 million in cash, and against which &mdash; even if the current rate of borrowing  by housing associations were considered &mdash; a further &pound;150 million to spend on  housing could be released. Has she given any consideration to using those  assets, which, if properly utilised &mdash; given her own calculations a moment ago &mdash;  could enable the building of another 2,000 houses?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  The Member and I have had discussions about article 40 contributions, and I  take his point on board that we are now entering a phase in which developers  may not find it as attractive to explore that route. However, when I have had  discussions with the Member&rsquo;s party colleague the Minister of the Environment,  I hope that we will be able to find some new and innovative ways of dealing with  that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Cash receipts and  housing association assets are, along with others, being explored by the  inter-departmental affordability implementation group on the Semple Report,  which I chair. We hope to be able to report by December. I am very conscious  that the Housing Executive is also exploring that issue because the bottom line  is that we must be able to increase the supply of social housing in order to  cater for the large number of people who are homeless or who are on the waiting  list &mdash; many of whom are in housing stress. I will get back to the Member on  that issue.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Child Support Agency</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development to provide an update on  future plans for Child Support Agency jobs in Northern Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO692/08> (AQO 692/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>: It  is my intention that the existing Northern Ireland Child Support Agency should  be wound up and that the delivery of its services should be brought under the  direct control of my Department. In reaching that decision, I concluded that  the needs of clients and staff would be best served by the agency&rsquo;s staff  remaining under the umbrella of the Northern Ireland Civil Service. The size  and scale of the new child support organisation has not been determined, so I  am not in a position to assess the impact on jobs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the agency&rsquo;s staff for the hard work that they  do. They handle complex and challenging work, and do so in a caring,  compassionate and sensitive manner that recognises the emotional difficulties  experienced by the parents who they deal with. I am confident that the  dedication and commitment demonstrated by the staff of the Child Support Agency  will carry the organisation through the challenging period ahead with a  continued clear focus on getting money to more children. I have written to all  MLAs indicating what I have done, as well as to NIPSA (Northern Ireland Public  Service Alliance) &mdash; the trade union that represents the vast majority of the  agency&rsquo;s staff &mdash; and to the staff in the Child Support Agency outlining what I  have just said.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  The Minister must be aware of the absolute frustration endured by so many  people in our constituencies because of  results from the Child Support Agency. Whatever plans the Minister has  for staff in the agency, they have to produce positive results in as short a  time as possible &mdash; no years of agonising wait. Will the Minister assure the  Assembly that she has no plans to privatise the Child Support Agency?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I gave the assurance that I have no plans to privatise the Child Support Agency  in my previous answer. I am conscious of the need to deliver a good quality  service to parents throughout Northern    Ireland who have suffered undue pressure and  stress.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, I have been conscious of the needs of many staff  who are employed in the Child Support Agency and who work on behalf of parents  throughout Northern Ireland  and eastern England.  That is why I decided to protect people in Northern Ireland and bring the  agency within the ambit of the Northern Ireland Civil Service.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I am glad to hear that the Minister will consult widely before going down the  route that she has outlined with regard to the Child Support Agency. That is a  good principle, particularly in light of recent events. Assuming that she  proceeds with her plan &mdash; and she has notified the Social Development Committee  of her intention to do so &mdash; how will she address the considerable  under-representation of the Protestant community in the agency when it comes  within the ambit of the Northern Ireland Civil Service?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I am sure that Mr Campbell, the Chairperson of the Social Development  Committee, knows that the Civil Service appoints staff on the basis of the  merit principle.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The Minister will be aware of  extensive concerns among staff in the Child Support Agency. What assurances can  she give to those people about their jobs?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I have arranged to meet Lord McKenzie, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for  the Department for Work and Pensions, later this month to discuss future  working arrangements between Great Britain  and Northern Ireland  and to discuss the protection of jobs. I will write to the Member with a more  detailed answer.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I apologise to the Minister, but, unfortunately, time is up.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">Adjourned 4.02 pm.</p>
