                refers to Members’ designation; it was to take effect until
                the commencement of a review under strand one of the Belfast

                State that that review commenced today. Therefore, with effect
                from today, Standing Order 3(8) reverts to the previous version,
                which was agreed by the Assembly on Friday 2 November 2001.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly endorses the principle of
                including in the Tax Credits Bill provision for the transfer of
                responsibility for policy and administration of Child Benefit
                and Guardians’ Allowance to the Inland Revenue and social
                security legislative changes consequential upon the
                establishment of new Tax Credits, and agrees that the Bill
                should be considered by the United Kingdom Government.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I seek the Assembly’s endorsement of the
                transfer of responsibility for child benefit to the Inland
                Revenue as part of the tax credit reforms aimed at relieving
                child poverty and encouraging people into work. Bringing
                together responsibility for child benefit and tax credits, so
                that they are administered by one source, will create a more
                streamlined and transparent system of support for children. The
                new system will be more accessible and more easily understood by
                claimants.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I seek the House’s agreement that this and
                other social security legislative changes that are consequential
                upon the establishment of new tax credits should be considered
                by the United Kingdom Government and carried in the Westminster
                Bill. It seems sensible that one instrument in one place should
                carry all the necessary amendments that affect the introduction
                of tax credits. Prior to today’s debate every Member received
                a memorandum explaining the background to tax credits. With
                regard to social security, there has always been parity with
                Great Britain. That is how it should be. I am happy to respond
                to Members’ questions as they arise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the 2000 Budget the Chancellor of the
                Exchequer announced the Government’s intention to introduce
                new payable tax credits for families with children and for those
                in low-paid work. Those new tax credits will be available from
                2003 and will be administered by the Inland Revenue. They will
                replace — and in some cases extend — the support currently
                available under working families’ tax credit, disabled person’s
                tax credit, the child elements of income support, income-based
                jobseeker’s allowance and children’s tax credit. A
                consultation exercise that included Northern Ireland was
                initiated in July 2001 and finished on 12 October. The document
                ‘New Tax Credits — Supporting Families, Making Work Pay,
                Tackling Poverty’ was widely distributed. It indicated that
                discussions were taking place with Northern Ireland Ministers to
                consider the impact of the proposed changes on Northern Ireland’s
                social security provision. No significant comments were
                forthcoming from Northern Ireland regarding that consultation
                process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Westminster legislation introducing tax
                credits will apply to the United Kingdom and will make
                consequential changes to social security benefits in Great
                Britain. The main changes requiring primary legislation are the
                removal of children’s and disabled children’s premiums in
                income support and jobseeker’s allowance and the removal of
                child dependency increases from certain other benefits. Those
                will be replaced by a new system of support for families with
                children in tax credits for new cases from April 2003. To meet
                that timetable, the Government propose to introduce legislation
                at Westminster shortly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding Northern Ireland, the Secretary of
                State for Work and Pensions wrote to the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister to confirm that tax credits would be
                introduced in 2003. It was proposed to transfer responsibility
                for policy and administration of child benefit in Great Britain
                to the Inland Revenue. The Secretary of State has offered to
                include the necessary consequential Northern Ireland legislative
                changes in the Westminster Bill, subject to the agreement of the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The transfer would affect 150 staff in the
                Social Security Agency. They would transfer from the Northern
                Ireland Civil Service to the Inland Revenue. Similar transfers
                that have taken place in Northern Ireland suggest that the terms
                and conditions of service are similar and have not proved
                contentious. A transfer of 229 staff has already taken place.
                Negotiations with the Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance
                will continue. The Department of Work and Pensions has indicated
                that, should the transfer take place, there will be no reduction
                in staff, and staff will not be transferred out of Northern
                Ireland. Assurances given to staff of the contributions unit and
                family credit unit at the Social Security Agency at the time of
                their transfer in 1999 to the Inland Revenue have been honoured.
                The Inland Revenue had to recruit additional staff to administer
                working families’ tax credit. There is a firm expectation that
                additional staff will be needed to deal with the new tax
                credits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the motion is not passed, the retention of
                child benefit administration within Northern Ireland’s social
                security system would probably entail significant costs by
                allowing the two systems to diverge in the long term. It would
                entail the considerable resource input of new information
                technology systems, which Northern Ireland would have to procure
                or, subject to the Department of Work and Pensions’ agreement,
                it would have to pay for that Department to maintain separate
                computer systems for Northern Ireland-only claims.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is difficult to quantify the time and
                costs involved in the consultation, negotiation and installation
                of a new computer system based in Northern Ireland, or the
                charges that the Department for Work and Pensions may levy to
                continue running the existing system to maintain Northern
                Ireland-only claims. It would require detailed negotiation;
                however, the costs are likely to be significant. Those costs
                plus the administrative costs involved would have to be met from
                within the Northern Ireland block. The Treasury may also raise
                concerns about funding social security costs that do not have
                equivalents in Great Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The transfer of responsibility for the
                administration of child benefit to the Inland Revenue would
                impact on recipients and staff. However, child benefit will
                continue as a universal benefit, which is not means-tested, and
                which is payable subject to similar conditions. Therefore there
                will be no differential impact on recipients. Experience from
                similar transfers has shown that there should be no differential
                impact on staff as regards equality, because terms and
                conditions of service are similar and have not proved to be
                contentious.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive noted the Chancellor’s
                proposal to establish new tax credits; accepted the offer to
                carry consequential Northern Ireland social security legislation
                in the Westminster Bill; and agreed, subject to Assembly
                approval, to the transfer of responsibility for child benefit to
                the Inland Revenue. I commend the motion to the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Social
                Development (Mr Cobain):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The crux of the matter is our role in
                scrutinising legislation — legislation that affects the
                citizens of Northern Ireland. We need to pay a great deal of
                attention to the precise terms of the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An official from the Department for Social
                Development appeared before the Social Development Committee on
                27 September 2001 to advise us on the steps taken in regard to
                the document ‘New Tax Credits — Supporting Families, Making
                Work Pay, Tackling Poverty’. I stress that I chose
                deliberately the term &quot;advise us&quot;. It is fair to say
                that the Committee did not feel that it was consulted; that is
                always the problem with so-called parity legislation. The
                Committee for Social Development encounters that problem
                frequently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Social security matters are devolved to the
                Assembly, but Westminster drives the law, often as part of tax
                and benefit reforms. I am not clear as to why it is considered
                necessary to devolve social security matters in the first place.
                However, they are devolved matters, and that is the dilemma we
                face.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Inland Revenue published the consultation
                document on tax credits in July 2001. The proposals for the tax
                credit regime were first outlined in the 1999 Budget and were
                reaffirmed in the Chancellor’s 2000 Budget statement. It is
                clear from the consultation document that the Chancellor and the
                Government intended that the proposals should apply throughout
                the UK. However, the Department did not engage with the
                Committee for Social Development until the end of September, and
                then it was simply to tell us what they planned to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members always insist on parity, especially
                when it is to ensure that people in Northern Ireland are not
                disadvantaged. Some people might say that choosing the
                Westminster route secures the parity arrangement that we seem to
                prefer. The Committee was told that Alistair Darling had offered
                the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                the opportunity to have Northern Ireland included in the
                forthcoming Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document entitled ‘Memorandum by the
                Minister for Social Development on the Proposed Transfer of
                Responsibility for Policy and Administration of Child Benefit
                and Guardian’s Allowance to the Inland Revenue and Social
                Security Changes Consequential on the Introduction of Child Tax
                Credits’ refers to the consultation that took place with
                Northern Ireland Ministers. I quote from paragraph 6, which
                concerns the Inland Revenue’s consultation document</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;… discussions were taking place with
                Northern Ireland Ministers to consider the impact of the
                proposed changes on Northern Ireland social security
                provision&quot;.</p>
                </font><i><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </font></i><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did that constitute consultation? Why were
                the discussions restricted to Ministers? Why was the Committee
                for Social Development not consulted?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we follow the parity argument in this case
                — that arrangements for tax credits should apply here — how
                do we arrange for that to come about? On the face of it, a
                single Bill taken through Westminster might well satisfy our
                needs if we felt that we were being consulted about it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may be worth reminding the House that the
                Northern Ireland version of the Social Security Fraud Bill was
                brought before us not so long ago. The Minister requested
                accelerated passage for that Bill, but it was denied. It was
                denied because Members insisted on exercising their right, under
                the Assembly rules, to conduct the Committee Stage to scrutinise
                the law affecting our citizens. If we agree to the motion today,
                will we deny ourselves the right to scrutinise tax credits law?
                It is possible that we may do more than that. We may signal our
                acceptance that social security matters, which are currently
                devolved, should return to Westminster. That may set a precedent
                on which we find ourselves divided. It is a major issue of
                constitutional importance. I would be interested to hear whether
                the Minister considers that the motion, if passed, would have a
                consequential effect on the Northern Ireland Act 1998.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In dealing with tax credits in the debate
                today, we are examining matters of principle — the principles
                of parity and scrutiny. Is our present scrutiny of social
                security matters worth a penny candle? How effective is it,
                especially if one starts from the principle of maintaining
                parity? The tax credits law will be scrutinised at Westminster.
                If the House agrees to the motion, our real problem would be
                that the Assembly has no procedures in place to allow us to feed
                our views into the consideration and scrutiny that will take
                place at Westminster. How can that happen? If it is an
                oversight, it is an unfortunate one. It does our electorate a
                great disservice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wherever the fault lies, the House deserves
                to know how the Minister expects Northern Ireland’s views on
                this important piece of legislation to be represented. The
                principles of if, how, and to what extent we can make an
                effective contribution to the scrutiny of law that is generated
                and processed in Westminster, but which affects us in Northern
                Ireland, are important. Those issues are likely to arise time
                and again, particularly in relation to social security matters,
                and in other fields. If the House agrees to accept the
                Westminster route, it is important that urgent action be taken
                and that arrangements be made to ensure that our views are
                listened to there. We need guarantees on that today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Westminster Bill proceeds without
                including Northern Ireland, where will that leave us? We will be
                back to the parity issue. The Minister has made it clear that we
                would need to introduce our own systems to match those in Great
                Britain. We will have to bear the cost of doing that, and that
                could be significant. We have no way of financing those systems,
                so the money will have to be found from within the Northern
                Ireland block grant. The bottom line is that our citizens will
                be less well-off.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am conscious that members of the Committee
                and other Members wish to speak. I expect that they will touch
                on issues such as job security and the employment implications
                for those involved in the administration and payment of
                benefits. I am sure that they will highlight their concerns
                about the detail of the proposed legislation and the effects
                that it will have on people here. It is important that those
                points be made, but is it enough that they are simply made here
                today? I think not. They need to be made in a debate during
                which the law is being scrutinised, wherever that may take
                place. If we fail to ensure that that happens, we will fail the
                people in the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Social Development Committee
                discussed the tax credits issue, it was decided that I should
                not express on behalf of the Committee any view on the transfer
                of a devolved matter back to Westminster — a procedural
                question. That is a matter for this House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My view is more clear-cut than that which was
                expressed on behalf of the Social Development Committee by its
                Chairperson.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has concerns about the possible
                divergence that might arise between the system here and that in
                Westminster. Nevertheless, because of my concerns, I ask the
                Minister not to move this motion today. It is being put through
                too hastily. I get the impression that we are reacting to what
                the Government in Westminster are telling us; there is a sense
                that we should be moving on. Our first responsibility is to the
                people in Northern Ireland who will experience changes, not
                least the 150 workers who will be affected if the motion is
                passed. Many members of the public would also experience
                changes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key issues that have not been addressed
                are staffing, accessibility and the cross-border matters that
                frequently arise, as Members who represent border areas know.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are told that 150 staff will transfer. The
                memorandum states that nothing contentious has arisen as a
                result of an earlier transfer to allow for new family credit
                arrangements, but that took place just two years ago. That time
                span is too short. The 150 workers whose future promotion
                opportunities may be affected would like more thought to be
                given to the arrangements that will be in place for them in five
                or 10 years’ time. We have not been given the answers to those
                fundamental questions. Negotiations with the trade unions are
                incomplete, and we should not pass this motion until those
                negotiations have been concluded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many parents have enquiries about
                accessibility. They want a front office arrangement, whereby
                they can come in off the street to ask questions or make
                complaints. Those arrangements have not been clarified. What
                will happen under the Inland Revenue? Will the important child
                benefit system be located in a back room of some Inland Revenue
                office? Accessibility is a central issue, and we need more
                information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many cross-border workers are already
                experiencing difficulties. The system is complicated, and if we
                transfer responsibility for tax credits to the Inland Revenue,
                it will become more complicated — it will then be completely
                beyond our control. At this stage, we do not have enough
                information about these key issues. We need wider and more
                detailed consultation. I ask the Minister to reconsider the
                motion. Then, when that consultation has been completed, the
                Minister can come back to the Assembly with another Bill.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. I am in no doubt that
                the administration should be transferred to the Inland Revenue
                for the reasons I am about to give.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate has come about as a result of the
                announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the
                Government intend to introduce new tax credits for families with
                children and those in low-paid work. New tax credits, which will
                be available from 2003, will provide more support for the most
                vulnerable in society and thus tackle child poverty and social
                exclusion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main aim of the scheme, however, is to
                make work pay. For many years, reliance on the benefit system
                has sometimes proved a better financial option than seeking
                employment. Nobody should be better off unemployed. The scheme
                aims to make employment a more attractive and viable option and
                will give people an opportunity to escape the cycle of
                deprivation. It also reinforces the Government’s commitment to
                combating poverty, particularly where it affects children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new tax credits will not detract from the
                current system, but will instead build on its strengths. It
                will, therefore, fulfil an important role in the world of
                benefits. This is to be a programme of reform intended to
                rationalise and consolidate the existing system of support. In
                doing so, it will make it easier to understand and more
                transparent, responsive and accessible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The scheme is particularly aimed at families
                with children and those in low-paid work, and it will bring all
                associated benefits under one umbrella, cutting down on
                pointless bureaucracy and red tape. The new system will
                introduce uniformity, with a common framework for assessment and
                payment, which will ensure that the people of Northern Ireland
                will be able to benefit from United Kingdom legislation. The
                change that we are debating today is not change to the form of
                support, but rather a change of policy. We are advocating that
                our legislation should mirror that in Westminster, making it a
                uniform system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will move to an examination of the
                financial implications of this transfer of responsibility. If we
                in Northern Ireland were to take sole responsibility for the new
                system, it would require finance that would become a burden on
                the public purse. Management of the scheme here would require a
                complete overhaul of the computer network to bring the system
                into line with that in the rest of the United Kingdom. We have
                been assured that the transfer will have no negative impact on
                the current system, or on the recipients. The staff concerned
                will be working for the Inland Revenue rather than the Northern
                Ireland Civil Service. They have been assured that there will be
                no job losses, and their terms and conditions of employment will
                be largely similar.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is envisaged that the transfer of the
                system will make the scheme much more accessible to users and,
                as a result, more effective, efficient and responsive to their
                needs. The new system will run on an annual cycle, which will
                ensure continuity and cut out pointless stops and starts midway
                through the year. This will remove any uncertainty about the
                level of support that a family is entitled to. It is also
                envisaged that the system will allow support to be finely
                targeted so that the most needy and vulnerable will be able to
                benefit from the resources available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the major aims of the new scheme is to
                promote equality. Unfortunately, the most needy in society are
                usually the most excluded and often face financial barriers in
                the labour market.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new tax credits scheme will promote
                inclusion rather than exclusion, and will extend support to
                those who were previously denied it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the transfer of responsibility for
                policy- making and administration of child benefit in Northern
                Ireland to the Inland Revenue.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                Social Development (Ms Gildernew):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I am
                concerned about the motion and about the way in which the
                Committee for Social Development was consulted. Whom does the
                Minister think the motion will benefit? It will not make access
                to benefit any easier.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP has already mentioned the effect on
                jobs in the Six Counties, and I know that the Northern Ireland
                Public Service Alliance (NIPSA) is strongly opposed to the
                motion. As elected representatives, Members deal with people who
                have difficulty obtaining their benefits. It will be difficult
                for Members — and for the public — to move away from dealing
                with local social security offices to dealing with the Inland
                Revenue, when they are trying to sort out entitlement to
                benefits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am surprised that the DUP wants to take
                powers away from the Assembly, given that it is so keen on
                devolved government. I thought that it would prefer the Assembly
                to be accessible and accountable. Rev Ian Paisley, for instance,
                has worked well with the Agriculture Committee and has obviously
                found such accountability to be of great benefit to the people
                he deals with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the issues relating to the Tax Credits
                Bill is whether benefits should go to the main carer. When it
                was first raised, that issue was extremely contentious, as it
                could mean that money is transferred from the mother’s purse
                to the father’s pocket. It will continue to be a contentious
                matter. We are not debating that today, but it would be in the
                interest of Members to be able to scrutinise the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the motion is passed, Members will be
                passing powers back to Westminster and affording the Assembly no
                chance of scrutinising or changing the Bill. It will mean that
                the Assembly will have no input into the legislation, and that
                will have a huge impact on our constituents. Passing on that
                responsibility could be viewed as political cowardice, at worst,
                or political laziness, at best. The Assembly should not transfer
                powers back to Westminster on matters in which it can make a
                difference.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP asked that the motion not be tabled
                today. However, it has been tabled, so Members should vote
                against it to prevent further disadvantage to the most needy and
                vulnerable in society. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The PUP is concerned about the procedure that
                the House is going through. I urge the Minister to reconsider
                the motion. Members have had this discussion before. We have
                this debate every time that parity legislation comes before the
                House. Members must try to get round the notion of parity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly debated a request for
                accelerated passage for the Social Security Fraud Bill. The Bill
                was not given accelerated passage, and the Minister had to come
                back to the House. One of the problems pointed out by Members
                was that Westminster had been working on the issue for six
                months before the Assembly even found out about it. The
                Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development, Mr Cobain,
                said something similar this morning. He said that Alistair
                Darling was supposed to have contacted our Ministers. Members of
                the Scottish Parliament were also asked for their feelings on
                the issue. It is a procedural matter, which creates a lot of
                difficulties. If Members do not support the motion, we will have
                to find the money from the Northern Ireland block. All those
                things pose problems for the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member agree that one of the
                potential problems with the transfer to the Inland Revenue is
                that Northern Ireland would not, automatically or immediately,
                receive annual uprating in line with Great Britain and that the
                vulnerable section of our community discussed today would be
                further disadvantaged?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the point I am making about the
                annual block. This also has implications for people who are
                already employed, for changes in their employment and for job
                losses. All of those points are important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I want to focus on the procedural
                matter between here and Westminster. This debate is about the
                return to Westminster of responsibility for matters that were
                transferred to Northern Ireland. Either we have a devolved
                Government and a legislative Assembly that will continue to try
                to make things better for people in Northern Ireland, or we do
                not; we have to get this right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a responsibility has been devolved, there
                is no reason for Westminster to take it back. We need to focus
                upon that very point. We will get lost with arguments about
                whether it is the right place or not. We have to decide whether
                we want to continue to accept parity. We need a proper
                discussion about parity, when the House can be informed and we
                can play a proper scrutiny role — that will be the litmus
                test.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, Standing Order 40 does not mention
                legislative parity. We must continue to look at that in order to
                find a way forward. I support the remarks made by the
                Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development. As members
                of that Committee, we face this regularly, owing to the number
                of pieces of parity legislation that come to us. Why did they
                give us all this parity with social security matters in the
                first place if they want to take it back again? As an Assembly
                we have to focus on existing procedures and on how we deal with
                parity. This must change; the House must be notified early in
                the process; and we need access to Westminster to enable us to
                start scrutinising at an early stage and not at the last minute.
                I urge the Minister to reconsider this and to find a different

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept what the Minister has told us about
                the significant costs that could be involved if we allow the two
                systems to diverge. However, like some others in the House —
                and I would like some answers in the Minister’s conclusion —
                I am concerned about paragraph 20 of his presentation, which
                deals with the movement of staff from the Northern Ireland Civil
                Service to the Imperial or Home Civil Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My concerns centre on the fact that many
                young people join the Civil Service on the basis that they will
                be able to transfer around Northern Ireland within the Civil
                Service. Many people from western parts of Northern Ireland move
                to Belfast for training and employment initially, hoping to move
                back to their home areas eventually.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to respond clearly to the
                fear that this may involve the curtailment of transfer and
                promotion opportunities for staff. I note that negotiations with
                NIPSA continue, and I hope that if the transfer comes about,
                staff will be allowed to choose whether to remain a part of the
                Northern Ireland Civil Service or to transfer to the Home Civil
                Service.</p>
                <b>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have severe problems with the motion. It is
                not clear what the outcome will be if the Assembly takes a
                decision on the matter. The motion says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;That this Assembly endorses the
                principle…&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are we endorsing the principle that pieces of
                serious public policy will revert to Westminster? If we support
                the motion, we are establishing a principle. I do not support
                that principle — I support devolution, and we should operate
                it properly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion goes on to propose that the
                administration of child benefit and guardians’ allowance be
                transferred to the Inland Revenue. I do not have a problem with
                ensuring that our administration is efficient and cost
                effective. Already, we efficiently administer working families’
                tax credit, disabled person’s tax credit, jobseeker’s
                allowance and the child-related elements of income support. I
                have a serious problem with transferring responsibility for
                child benefit and guardians’ allowance policy. The Assembly
                already supports the appointment of a children’s commissioner.
                Will we really transfer responsibility for policy in the
                enormous area of child welfare to the taxman? Is the Inland
                Revenue the right body to have responsibility for policy on
                those issues? I have a problem with that, and I will not be
                supporting the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion also asks us to give
                responsibility to the Inland Revenue for rafts of unspecified,
                consequential changes in social security legislation. It would
                be madness for us to give such responsibility back to
                Westminster. I have not seen the legislation, and I cannot
                endorse that. If we say it is all right for Westminster to
                legislate and that we do not want to see the script, the Bills
                or the Orders, that subverts the role of the Assembly
                Committees, particularly that of the Committee for Social
                Development. This is a complete abdication of the responsibility
                of the Assembly and its Committees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two other issues concern me. We have heard
                hints of a massive cost implication if we do not go along with
                the motion. Figures of around £5 million have been whispered. I
                can see no reason why the administrative element should not
                proceed, with the Inland Revenue footing the bill as it has in
                other cases.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for giving way. I will
                respond to these points, but the Member is living in fantasy
                land if he thinks that the Inland Revenue will cough up money to
                maintain and develop a new and separate computer system for
                Northern Ireland when it is offering to include us in its own
                system. Either we provide a new computer and IT system and the
                necessary administration, or the Inland Revenue will charge us
                for it. We must not indulge in fantasy politics.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Fee:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has eloquently illustrated my
                next point. There is no reason for not bringing in and
                administering an Inland Revenue system for Northern Ireland. The
                Inland Revenue wants policy and legislative authority over
                social security issues here, and I do not believe that we should
                allow that. The Treasury will put up the money on its terms —
                if we cede authority. The Treasury is pushing us around, and we
                should resist.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Have we all lost our ambition for this place?
                Are we giving away any prospect of gaining tax-varying powers
                for the Assembly in the future? I do not know about other
                Members, but I will not give up trying on that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion proposed by the
                Minister, but I want to make several comments. It is vital that
                our legislation be brought into line with that in the rest of
                the United Kingdom. Continuity of the system is vital, as is
                equality for all. We have concerns about several points, some of
                which have already been expressed; staffing is one of them. The
                transfer of 150 staff from the Social Security Agency to the
                Inland Revenue has raised concerns about job transfer. Can the
                Minister tell us what stage the discussions are at? Have the
                outstanding issues been dealt with, and does he believe that
                staff will be happy to settle for the changes in their security?
                Will more staff be needed to deal with the new children’s tax
                credit as well as the new changes?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Concern has been expressed that the
                changeover could cause delays in the payment of child benefit.
                Can the Minister confirm that manual payments will be made to
                cover short-term delays in payment, should they arise? We want
                to ensure that there will be no delays for those who need the
                money most.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Point 6 of the Minister’s statement said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;No significant comments were received
                from Northern Ireland.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That shows that some of the people who
                expressed concern this morning said nothing during the
                consultation process, and it is a bit late in the day for them
                to do that now. Why did they not do so earlier? The consultation
                paper was widely distributed, so perhaps they will address that
                point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has described the legislation
                that is required, and the reason for it, but further points must
                be made, notably about consultation. Can the Minister confirm
                that the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister fully scrutinised the proposed legislation? If so, when
                did that scrutiny allow discussion with the parties and other
                groups in the Assembly?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most important is the matter of money. Can
                the Minister clearly detail why he must have this legislation
                immediately? If there is any delay whatsoever in implementing
                the legislation, what will the financial implications be? When
                people consider them, they will realise how necessary the
                legislation is.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have already begun to consider some of the
                difficulties that members of the Committee for Social
                Development faced when dealing with this. The Chairperson was
                correct to say that the outcome of the deliberations was
                inconclusive. We were neither for nor against the move — we
                simply could not agree. It is not surprising that there is a
                divergence of views in the Chamber. However, as Members are
                aware, a significant issue is at stake. Child benefit is a
                devolved matter. We have control over it. If responsibility for
                the policy and administration of child benefit is transferred to
                the Inland Revenue since taxation is a reserved matter, we will
                have handed back a devolved responsibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is interesting to see Nigel Dodds, in his
                role as Minister, advocating that we do that. He has been the
                champion of devolved responsibilities in the past, yet he now
                says that we do not want responsibility for child benefit, which
                should return to Westminster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister and Jim Shannon use arguments
                about financial costs and time implications to blackmail the
                Assembly into supporting the motion. As my Colleague, John Fee,
                pointed out, this is a difficult motion to be certain about —
                even its structure leaves a lot to be desired. The Minister
                requests that we support the motion. He says that if we do not,
                the additional cost to the Budget could possibly be £5 million,
                and that if we do not make the decision today, we could be left
                behind. We should not allow ourselves to be blackmailed by
                anybody, because that would negate what we are supposed to be
                doing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at the Minister’s arguments.
                This is not the first occasion when the time factor has been
                used to push things forward. In those instances, the Assembly
                has democratically decided to take its time and to ensure that
                it has all the facts in order to make a correct decision. We
                should not be too impressed by that argument.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Though figures were mentioned, we have yet to
                see a proper analysis of the possible costs. We do not know how
                much it will cost, nor how much of that cost will be picked up
                by the Inland Revenue. We have not been informed of the benefits
                to accessibility, openness and transparency, jobs or the
                protection of promotion prospects within the Civil Service.
                Neither have we seen an analysis of the benefits of the
                introduction of new technology into the present system — that
                is bound to be beneficial. If we had those analyses, we might be
                able to weigh up the pros and cons of the argument and come to a
                correct decision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Michelle Gildernew remarked on the SDLP
                attitude. My party is asking the Minister not to move the motion
                today, which is his privilege. If he does not move the motion,
                the Committee can have a period of further deliberation and
                consultation. If the Minister insists on moving the motion,
                against the concerns of a number of Members and parties, we will
                vote against it. That is our clear position on the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a social democratic party, the SDLP argues
                that the Assembly should have full responsibility for all social
                issues. Transferral of responsibility to the Inland Revenue,
                with its reputed lack of transparency, does not bring us forward
                into open and transparent devolved Government, but backward. We
                have major concerns about moving in that direction.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. I am a little perturbed
                by some of Mr ONeill’s comments. I am not saying that they
                were in any way insincere, but they were difficult to
                understand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members have questioned the issue of
                parity: should we or should we not? I agree that blindly
                following parity is the wrong principle on which to support the
                motion. However, where it is proven and demonstrated to be to
                the distinct advantage of the people of Northern Ireland, we can
                have no hesitation in saying that parity is the way forward.
                Those issues where parity may not be to our advantage are
                obviously a different matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone in the Assembly has the right to
                vote against the motion, but with that right comes
                responsibility. The sum of money is approximately £5 million.
                Where do we find £5 million? Can we tell the Exchequer in
                London that we have deviated from parity and taken a different
                line on the issue, and that they should put up £5 million?
                Anyone who thinks that that would work does not live in the real
                world. The Exchequer would say that we made the decision to
                deviate onto another road, and that we can therefore pay for it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During my time as Minister for Social
                Development, the Alliance Party proposed a very good motion to
                increase pensions by £5. No one in the House had any problem
                with that idea, but it would have had to be paid for from our
                own pocket. The first question was, therefore, &quot;Where do we
                find the £50 million to pay for that?&quot;. At that stage,
                cold reality took over.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members have played up the potential for
                job losses. I have read the Minister’s memorandum, and I am
                satisfied that the opposite will be the case. Jobs will be
                created. Paragraph 13 states that</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Secretary of State for Work and
                Pensions, Alistair Darling, has indicated that should the
                transfer take place there will be no reduction in staff
                requirements nor will any staff be transferred out of Northern
                Ireland. Assurances given in 1999 at the time of the transfer of
                staff in the Social Security Agency Contributions Unit and
                Family Credit Unit to the Inland Revenue have been
                honoured.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who talk of potential job losses are
                ducking and diving. That issue is a red herring. It does not
                exist. There will be no loss of jobs. Jobs will be created.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a responsibility to support the
                motion. This is not the time to prove a point, political or
                otherwise, to the cost of the people of Northern Ireland. The
                tab will be picked up by them alone, not by the Assembly. The
                Minister will undoubtedly clarify points of genuine concern at
                the end of the debate.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise for not being present at the
                start of the debate. I support the motion for three reasons.
                First, it was said that those who opposed the motion wished to
                preserve devolved power. That power is not real; it is cosmetic,
                and it is a veil. Child benefit in Northern Ireland is
                administered at the same rate as in the rest of the United
                Kingdom, and it is inconceivable that we would wish that
                position to change in future. Therefore, it is a power without
                any great benefit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, those who attempt to take a
                principled stance to preserve that small part of devolved power
                are in grave danger of hurting the poor. That is a strange
                attitude for parties that claim to have a social, democratic or
                radical basis to take. A parity principle is in place; the
                levels of social services and benefits across the United Kingdom
                should be the same. That principle was established — at some
                cost and difficulty — by previous Administrations that
                operated from this House during the 1920s, and after 1945, when
                the Labour Government under Attlee developed the welfare state
                in the UK.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members should hesitate before they throw out
                the motion and threaten the long-established and beneficial
                practice of parity in social services and benefits in the United
                Kingdom. That is the longer-term danger should the motion be
                rejected. The more immediate danger, as has already been stated,
                is that an attempt to establish our own duplicate services for
                tax credits might incur costs. Those services would uselessly
                mirror the Inland Revenue in London.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, a consultation exercise on
                integrated child and employment tax credits ran from the summer
                to the autumn. I responded to that, and I wonder how many of the
                opponents of the motion took that opportunity to raise some of
                the issues that we have heard today.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I oppose the motion. If we have devolved powers, we should not
                hand them back. It is Committees’ role to scrutinise
                legislation. Why did the issue not go before the Committee for
                Social Development? Did its Chairperson, Mr Cobain, equivocate
                because the issue did not go before the Committee, or is he
                opposed to the power being returned to Westminster? That
                important distinction must be made. We heard that jobs will not
                be lost. However, if jobs are not to be lost, why would we
                transfer back the power? The issue must be teased out more
                thoroughly, and I support the SDLP’s view that it should be
                either postponed or withdrawn.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committees’ role is to scrutinise, and
                I would like the Chairperson of the Committee for Social
                Development to clarify whether he is unsure about that, or
                whether he feels that the point is valid and that the motion
                should be scrutinised before any further action is taken.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened carefully to Members’
                points. Many raised important issues and concerns, and I hoped
                that I had dealt earlier with some of those; indeed, in my
                opening remarks I addressed some of the themes that were raised.
                However, I am happy to address those concerns again, and to deal
                with other issues that arose.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will try to explain why we are at this
                stage and why we are proceeding in this way. It is in the
                interests of the recipients of child benefit and the people of
                Northern Ireland. I have heard arguments about principles and
                parity; and there may need to be further debate in Committees
                and in the House about parity as it relates to the area of
                social security. People speak about having power over social
                security but, as Dr Birnie rightly reminded us, it is a power
                that is never exercised. Who in their right mind would want to
                exercise that power to the detriment of the people of Northern
                Ireland by creating a less favourable situation than exists in
                the rest of the UK?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will return to that theme, but we must
                concentrate on the matter before us, and on what impact the
                motion will have. Let us deal with issues such as devolution and
                principle, but let us not lose sight of the impact there will be
                on Northern Ireland — and the implications for the Northern
                Ireland block — if we do not proceed in this way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Cobain, the Chairperson of the Committee
                for Social Development, Mr Hutchinson, Mr Gallagher and others
                raised the issue of the role of the Committee. There has been
                much talk about the role of the Assembly in relation to tax
                credits and tax credits legislation. The Inland Revenue is
                responsible for the Tax Credits Bill: the Assembly has no choice
                in the matter. Taxation is a reserved matter, whether we like it
                or not. The matter is being brought forward at Westminster,
                whether we like it or not. That is the reality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We could talk all day about this, but the
                Chancellor and the Government at Westminster have responsibility
                for the matter and are proceeding with it. The Government are
                going down this route, and we are merely being asked to consider
                the changes that will result from the establishment of tax
                credits. There seems to be a misunderstanding that we could have
                a role to play if we deferred the matter. The Bill is going
                ahead; all that the Assembly is being asked to do is to deal
                with the consequences. The choice is between maintaining the
                administration of child benefit using our own computer systems,
                administration, and the cost of doing that, and transferring
                that responsibility to the Inland Revenue following the changes
                under the tax credits legislation. This is not a situation
                where, if we do not go through with this, we can sit down and
                discuss the issue of tax credits. That is not the issue. Some
                Members have greatly misunderstood what we are being asked to
                do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document that Dr Birnie referred to, ‘New
                Tax Credits — Supporting Families, Making Work Pay, Tackling
                Poverty’, was published in July. There was a 12-week
                consultation period that finished on 12 October. I presume that
                all Members who were so exercised about the issue responded
                during the consultation period. I will look carefully at the
                responses of Members who raised these issues to make sure that
                they did so to the relevant Government, which in this case is
                Westminster. A copy of the document was sent to each MLA —
                indeed it was sent wider afield. As I made clear to the House
                from the start, no significant concerns were raised —
                according to those who deal with the policy and practical aspect
                of these issues. I will deal with the staff employment issues
                shortly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Chairperson said, a letter providing
                details of tax credits, dated 20 September, was sent to the
                Committee for Social Development. We should remember that tax
                credits are not a devolved issue for Northern Ireland; they are
                an issue for Westminster. It was not possible to bring the
                matter before the Committee earlier due to the confidential
                nature of correspondence. Members often wax eloquent and lyrical
                about the agreement, the legislation, and so on. However, in
                keeping with the memorandum of understanding and the devolution
                guidance note 8, the Executive must respect the confidentiality
                of such exchanges between the mainland United Kingdom Government
                and the Assembly as a devolved institution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall examine ways to involve the Committee
                in such issues as early as possible. My record, and that of my
                predecessor, shows that we try to do that as much as is
                possible. However, we have to deal with a mechanism and a
                framework that sometimes circumscribe our ability to do that. It
                is not of our making, but we have to deal with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already mentioned the limited response
                to the consultation process. However, I re-emphasise that
                responsibility for tax credits does not fall within the Assembly’s
                remit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Billy Hutchinson mentioned the situation in
                Scotland. We have discussed devolution, and whether it is a real
                power. In regions of England, Scotland and Wales, the Scottish
                Parliament is held up as an example of the best and strongest
                form of devolution. However, the Scottish Parliament does not
                have responsibility for social security. Therefore, the idea
                that there is a massive point of principle involved in the
                benefits issue in Northern Ireland is misguided. The recipients
                of those benefits must be kept at the forefront of the debate.
                The Scottish Parliament would be consulted only about those
                areas within its control that are affected by tax credits —
                issues such as training. We must be clear about the real issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members, including Mr ONeill, have asked
                me to delay the motion. However, by so doing, we would lose the
                opportunity to have the consequential changes carried at
                Westminster. The Assembly cannot avoid the task, for the
                Westminster Bill is ready to go before Parliament, where
                responsibility for tax credits lies, and where decisions will be
                taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have also dealt with the costs issue.
                Members have spoken about a procedural matter of principle —
                it is more than that. A decision that is not in the best
                interest of the people of Northern Ireland will affect the
                Northern Ireland Budget and block. The estimated cost of
                procuring and operating a computer system to handle Northern
                Ireland-only child benefit claims and administration is likely
                to be some £5 million per annum. As a Member from this side of
                the House asked, what purpose does that serve if it is simply to
                duplicate what has already been done in Great Britain? The
                current charge is £215,000. Annual maintenance charges are
                likely to be much higher than that £215,000, given the need to
                maintain a similar service to that provided in Great Britain.
                That £5 million will supply only the basic, minimum system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It does not take account of future
                development costs of keeping the system in line with changes
                that may occur in Great Britain. This is not something that
                Members can vote on without there being an implication here —
                there are strong implications.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Assembly decides to retain this area
                of child benefit administration, it must be aware of the
                consequences. The reality is that Members will want to maintain
                child benefit at the same rate and under the same conditions as
                elsewhere. Regarding the talk about power and where it lies, is
                anyone seriously going to come before the Assembly and suggest
                that we should not have the same position as elsewhere? The
                increases are funded centrally, they are demand-led, and they do
                not come out of the Northern Ireland block. Of course, Members
                might suggest differences that will have to be met out of the
                Northern Ireland block — I would be interested to hear where
                that money is likely to come from.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reality is that the Assembly will want to
                maintain parity so that our people receive the same benefits as
                those elsewhere. If this motion is not passed today, we will
                need a system that will guarantee payment to Northern Ireland
                recipients. We will have to make provision for the introduction
                of new computer systems and the associated administrative costs.
                We cannot run away from this reality. The idea that the Inland
                Revenue will pick up the costs is simply pie-in-the-sky, fantasy
                nonsense. What compelling argument could be advanced to suggest
                that the Inland Revenue would be willing to finance a separate
                system when it is offering to include that as part of an overall
                UK-wide system? Clearly, the costs would have to be borne out of
                the Northern Ireland block — that is the reality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher mentioned cross-border workers.
                We have been down this route before. Working families’ tax
                credit already deals with such workers on a satisfactory basis.
                The problem was recognised when the system was established and
                measures built in. I hope that that takes care of the point Mr
                Gallagher and others made on that issue. Some Members referred
                to benefits for women and lone parents. Much of the benefit of
                the new integrated child credit will go to women, including lone
                parents. People with disabilities will continue to benefit from
                support as now. It has been concluded that there have been no
                identified negative differential impacts arising from a person’s
                sexual orientation, political or religious beliefs. Of course,
                that situation will continue to be monitored, and a final
                equality impact assessment will be issued after the consultation
                period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What are the advantages? Some Members,
                including Mr Gallagher, asked who will benefit from this and
                expressed concern about access. I emphasise that child benefit
                will continue to be administered in Northern Ireland. People
                will continue to have access to the same staff on the same basis
                as at present — we have seen this happen already in the case
                of working families’ tax credit. I would be interested to know
                of any Member’s representations of dissatisfaction on that
                score — and I am talking here about access to staff, not to
                the system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consultation with the union will continue.
                The transfer will not take place until 2003 and, as I said in my
                opening remarks, will affect some 150 staff in the Social
                Security Agency. Similar transfers have taken place before
                involving 229 staff — 106 from family credit and 123 from the
                contributions unit. Those transfers clearly suggest that terms
                and conditions of service are similar, and they have not proved
                contentious.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Negotiations with NIPSA will continue as part
                of the overall consultation process. Some Members raised the
                issue of staff transfers and the number of staff that will be
                required. There will be no reduction in staff requirements, and
                staff will not be transferred out of Northern Ireland. The
                Inland Revenue had to recruit additional staff to administer the
                working families’ tax credit. It is expected that additional
                staff will be needed to deal with the new children’s tax
                credit. Mr Shannon raised the possibility of delays in manual
                payments. Delays will be likely only if the motion is not passed
                and if the Assembly breaks with the parity principle and the
                current system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The additional costs that would result from
                the failure to pass the motion would have to be met from
                elsewhere in the Northern Ireland block, as would the
                administrative costs. I have further long-term concerns
                regarding the issue of parity. The Treasury may raise concerns
                that funding for something that is classified as social security
                costs in Northern Ireland does not have a corresponding social
                security benefit in Great Britain. The Assembly must recognise
                that, and it may have to deal with the issue. We can discuss the
                issues with the Government at Westminster and lobby there.
                However, those issues must be decided at Westminster. As tax
                credits and child benefit become more closely aligned and
                developed by the Inland Revenue, it will become increasingly
                difficult for Northern Ireland to replicate those changes. The
                Assembly would have to decide how to legislate for the annual
                upgrading of those benefits, the amounts to be upgraded and the
                basis for the upgrading. Whether any increases would be in line
                with the increase in child benefit set by the Inland Revenue, or
                possibly determined by some other method is a further
                consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is difficult to envisage circumstances in
                which the Assembly would not want to maintain parity.
                Considerable costs will be incurred by allowing the systems to
                diverge in the long term. Section 87 of the Northern Ireland Act
                1998 — a piece of legislation that many Members have quoted as
                something that must be supported and reinforced — states that:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Secretary of State and the Northern
                Ireland Minister having responsibility for social security
                (&quot;the Northern Ireland Minister&quot;) shall from time to
                time consult one another with a view to securing that, to the
                extent agreed between them, the legislation to which this
                section applies provides single systems of social security,
                child support and pensions for the United Kingdom&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They have agreed to continue to operate the
                existing parity system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The argument that such a motion, which is of
                benefit to the people of Northern Ireland and to the Northern
                Ireland block, is against devolution per se, is ludicrous and
                without foundation, particularly when compared to the situation
                in Scotland. The Assembly has a duty to bring that forward in
                the interest of the recipients of child benefit. The concept of
                parity means that people in Northern Ireland pay the same rate
                of income tax and national insurance contributions as elsewhere.
                In return they have access to the same range of benefits, both
                contributory and non-contributory, paid at the same rates and
                subject to the same rules and conditions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would welcome a debate on the wider issues
                and principles; that could be beneficial. However, the accepted
                view is that parity works to the advantage of the Province.
                Contributory benefits, such as retirement pensions and
                incapacity benefit, are funded from national insurance
                contributions. The amount raised in Northern Ireland from those
                contributions is insufficient to meet the demands of those
                benefits. It has been so for a long time. The shortfall in the
                Northern Ireland national insurance fund is made up by a
                transfer from the fund in Great Britain. Similarly, in relation
                to non-contributory benefits financed from taxation revenue,
                expenditure is demand-led and outside the managed block. That is
                in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that I have addressed most of the
                issues raised. When Hansard is printed, I will ensure that
                Members receive a written response to any matters that I may
                have omitted. I remind the Assembly that the main purpose of the
                debate is to give Members the opportunity to endorse the
                principle that in Northern Ireland all social security benefits
                should continue to operate in strict parity with Great Britain,
                and thus be fully funded by the Treasury. Agreeing to the
                transfer of the administration of child benefit to the Inland
                Revenue is the only way for Northern Ireland to maintain that
                position.</p>

                we have problems with the way in which this is being advanced. A

                runs contrary to the guidelines, custom and practice that have
                developed through the requirements of equality legislation.
                Having put down that marker, we will work with the Ad Hoc
                Committee to ensure that there is the fullest possible public
                consultation on this. The Assembly needs to debate the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not good enough that we should have
                such a short time. That is the way in which several issues
                presented to the House have been managed — perhaps
                deliberately — by the Government at Westminster. It is unfair
                to force us to rush through our consideration of far-reaching
                reforms of the legal system. I reiterate the point made by Mr
                McLaughlin: it is wrong, in principle, for the Government to put
                the Assembly in that position. They have done so before, and
                they have now done so again on an issue of fundamental
                importance to the community. On behalf of SDLP Members, I

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Education met the £3
                million costs of the education and library boards’ ‘connecting
                teachers to ICT’ programme, which trained teachers in core
                information and communication technology (ICT) skills in
                preparation for their training in the use of ICT in their
                subject areas. The new opportunities fund is funding the latter
                training with a grant of £10·81 million over three years. The
                Department has also assisted schools with that comprehensive
                training programme by providing £20 million for 12,000 laptop
                computers and almost 1,000 digital projectors, and by granting
                exceptional closure days that can be used for the training.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A further £15·8 million has been made
                available to enhance electrical and data cabling circuits in
                schools. I also recently announced an investment of £16 million
                to implement the Classroom 2000-managed services in 574 small
                primary schools over the next eight months. That is the first of
                several procurements that are well under way. The plan is to
                award the contract for the remaining primary schools at the end
                of January, and the contract for special and secondary schools
                before the end of this school year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All that major investment is additional to
                the schools’ computer-based administration systems and the
                NINE Connect Internet services, which are already in place. It
                is envisaged that the Classroom 2000 managed services will be
                available in all schools by the start of the 2003 school year.
                Through the entire process, expenditure has been managed
                centrally in order to minimise the bureaucratic burden on
                schools, so that they can concentrate on the educational use of
                ICT.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ICT has an important role to play in
                education. When used effectively in teaching and learning, it
                helps to raise standards. Teachers have responded well to the
                challenge. I have no doubt that their training programme, the
                NINE Connect services and Classroom 2000 provide the kind of
                support that enables teachers and learners to be creative in
                their use of the new educational technologies.</p>

                new infrastructure for Northern Ireland. Does the Minister not
                consider the resources that he has announced today — and
                previously — inadequate to ensure sufficient provision to
                allow Northern Ireland to compete equally on the European scene?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyone who listened carefully to my answer to
                Mr Murphy would know that the Department of Education had put a
                great deal of finance into the development of Classroom 2000.
                During the recent negotiations, there have been some
                difficulties, which we are now well on our way to overcoming.
                The Department has put important resources directly into the
                classroom and will continue to do that in the coming months. It
                will pay off. Young people, teachers and everyone else in the
                education system understand the vital importance of ICT in the
                classroom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we have said recently, we are seeking to
                bring about a modern education system for a modern world and,
                indeed, for modern children, who are well up to the challenge.
                On my travels, I have been amazed by some 80-year-old
                &quot;children&quot; who think it important to attend training
                courses on ICT. There have been many examples of that, and there
                is a growing appreciation, particularly within education, of the
                importance of ICT in people’s lives.</p>

                diverting scarce resources to that end. Therefore, I have no

                compulsory, because they help children to avoid being
                stigmatised or being seen as different? Does the Minister
                recognise the hardship and debt that is faced by many families?
                How can he justify uniform grants being given for post-primary
                school pupils and not for primary school pupils?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Generally, uniforms for primary schools are
                simple and cheaper. Most primary schools have a school tie that
                is distinctive, but the rest of the uniforms can usually be
                obtained from any of the major chain stores and, hence, at
                competitive prices. Some schools may require a sweater with
                distinctive piping, but that is not a major cost.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must have regard to spending priorities,
                and my aim is to ensure that the maximum level of resources is
                directed to classrooms. Extending the clothing allowance scheme
                would be relatively expensive. A grant of £50 would cost an
                additional £2 million a year. Funding would have to come from
                elsewhere in the budget, and I cannot justify diverting
                resources to this at present.</p>

                the additional cost of sports equipment, and so on, is no longer
                a source of embarrassment for families on low income? Whether it
                is a tennis racquet or a camogie stick, can he assure us that no
                child is embarrassed by not having one?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are keen to see that no children are
                embarrassed by any situation that can develop in schools.
                Regarding school uniforms, the modest sum that is granted to
                families by the education and library boards is to deal with
                basic clothing. If we start supplying equipment for sporting
                occasions, the education budget will rocket. That is where
                important decisions have to be made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Increasingly, the Department of Education is
                concerned to see that money goes directly to the classrooms.
                That is vital. Clothing grants are a matter for the education
                and library boards and parents. Dealing with the issue that the
                Member has raised would have to mean a substantial increase in
                my allocation from the block grant, and that would mean a huge

                as they consider necessary, or as are directed by the
                Department, to facilitate the attendance of pupils at
                grant-aided schools. The arrangements made by boards are subject

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current approved arrangements, introduced

                unable to gain a place in all suitable schools within statutory
                walking distance of their home: that is two miles for primary
                school pupils and three miles for others, measured by the
                nearest available route.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The term &quot;suitable school&quot; relates

                exists in the Foyle constituency? Parents are advised, when
                their son leaves primary school, to nominate a school that is
                not his first choice. Parents do this in the knowledge that
                their child will not be accepted because of enhanced criteria
                used at that school to determine those entitled to free school
                transport. If they do not go through that procedure, the parents
                must pay for their child to attend the grammar school of their
                choice. That issue needs to be addressed.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The transport arrangements must be
                administered fairly and equitably. Many grammar schools admit
                pupils with lower test grades. The guidance makes it clear that
                to qualify for transport assistance to a school outside
                statutory walking distance, parents must formally apply for and
                be refused a place in all schools in the chosen category that
                are within statutory walking distance. No exceptions are made on
                the basis of possible rejection by nearer schools. That does not
                affect the likelihood of a child being admitted to other
                schools, as the order of preference expressed by parents may not
                be included in schools’ admission criteria. Any child refused
                a place at a nearer school would have his or her application for
                admission to more distant schools considered on its own merits
                and on an equal footing with all other applications received by
                the school.</p>

                We must, however, recognise that the full implementation of its
                recommendations would require significant additional resources.
                Some £42 million would be needed for capital costs, as well as
                £23 million for running costs to remove standing passengers on
                school buses and the three-for-two seating arrangement. Further
                substantial costs would be associated with other
                recommendations, such as the installation of seat belts. There

                and that it delays unnecessarily the implementation of a new and

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to take sufficient time to
                agree the best way forward rather than to rush into
                ill-considered change. These matters are vital to the future of
                our education system. For that reason, I decided that there
                should be an extended consultation period. Our overriding
                objective must be to create an education system that will enable
                all children to reach their full potential. I intend to consider
                carefully all the responses we receive, and proposals for future
                post-primary arrangements will be discussed by the Executive,
                the Education Committee and the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been heartened by how the debate has
                been conducted by everyone — educationalists, schools,
                teachers, principals, boards of governors and the Assembly —
                not only during the last couple of weeks, but over some 18
                months. Many parties have made a huge contribution towards the
                sensible and mature discussions that we must have if we are to
                deal with such an important issue for children and the education
                system. I want to pay tribute to Assembly Members, who have
                adopted a well-considered approach to this. By the way in which
                they have contributed to the debate, they have shown that the
                prospects and opportunities for children are much more important
                than anything else. That is encouraging. I hope that people will
                continue to think carefully about this. From next January they
                can contribute to a debate which is vital to everyone.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, we should pay tribute to Gerry Burns
                and the review body for producing an important report. What is
                pleasing about the review is that it places children at the
                centre of its thinking. It places the needs and rights of all
                children above the preservation of structures, which is crucial.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who have been involved in considering
                the weighty body of research which has recently been put before
                us know that there are serious weaknesses in the education
                system. The research conducted by Prof Tony Gallagher from Queen’s
                University and Prof Alan Smith from the University of Ulster,
                together with the work carried out by Save the Children and the
                Education Committee, has shown up those weaknesses. The
                Committee has made it clear that we must accept that change is
                necessary and appropriate, and the Assembly has endorsed that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We know the difficulties that exist. Much of
                children’s time is wasted in preparing for the transfer test
                — at the expense of real learning. One third of children who
                benefit from a grammar school education do so at the expense of
                the two thirds who are regarded as failures. The confidence and
                self-esteem of those two thirds takes a terrible knock that is
                difficult to restore in the secondary sector. Inevitably, the
                selection process also leaves a long tail of low-achieving
                schools. Only 10% of children from low-income families make it
                to grammar schools. Indeed, that figure is as low as 2% in the
                Shankill Road area. That is totally unacceptable and makes a
                very convincing case for change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Change is needed. The fact that the Committee
                for Education and the Burns review body have spoken on this
                indicates that their approach is correct. We need an education
                system based on equality, excellence, choice and accessibility.
                The big challenge for us is to provide an education system where
                all children — irrespective of their backgrounds or
                circumstances — can realise their potential. We need a modern
                education system that caters for all children and gives them the
                confidence and encouragement to move into a new era.</p>

                that will benefit all concerned, both in the number of modular
                examinations that are taken and in the reduced possibility of
                timetable clashes. Pupils will now be able to take all the
                written examination requirements of a full AS level in a single
                half- day session of up to three hours, instead of a possible
                four and a half hours in separate sessions. That will mean fewer
                examinations and, therefore, less chance of timetable clashes.</p>

                receipt of those reports, which are due to be completed by the
                end of December.</p>

                already announced new arrangements that will benefit everybody
                concerned. We have looked carefully at the way that AS levels
                have been managed. They are a comparatively new development. We
                would have been surprised if there had been no initial hiccups
                or difficulties to be addressed. We have certainly addressed the
                problems that have been brought to our attention. Problems have
                been created, not least for pupils, parents and teachers.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Concerning the first issue raised by Mr
                Wilson, I say categorically that the allegations he made were
                untrue and unjustified. I have consistently maintained that the
                schools capital building programme is determined by educational
                needs, be they in controlled or voluntary schools or in any
                other schools sector. The make-up of last year’s conventional
                school building programme was six Catholic maintained school
                projects, costing £25·7 million; 10 controlled school
                projects, costing £24·1 million, including two special schools
                which were the capital priorities of two education and library
                boards; and one grant maintained integrated school project,
                costing £12·5 million. In addition, provision was included for
                eight secondary projects with a total capital value of
                approximately £70 million under public-private partnership, and
                those are grouped under three separate contracting authorities.
                The Trustees of Catholic Maintained Schools in the Derry diocese
                have been allocated £34 million, the North Eastern Education
                and Library Board, £15 million and the South Eastern Education
                and Library Board, £21 million.</p>

                reserve his right to deal with the detail of his capital
                expenditure plans in accordance with his Department’s
                timetable. However, will he assure me that projects where a
                clear need has been identified, or where a site has been
                purchased and an economic appraisal completed, will receive
                priority? The new buildings for Loanends Primary School in my
                constituency of South Antrim are an example, particularly
                because the board of that school hoped to be among the new

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I certainly appreciate the concerns of
                schools and their authorities who have advanced their projects
                by completing an economic appraisal. My point of view, and that
                of the Department of Education, has always been that that is a
                prerequisite of ensuring a school’s eligibility for a place in
                the programme. Projects must be supported by an economic
                appraisal and be at a suitable stage of planning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Projects are selected according to
                educational need, not the length of time that they have spent on

                for 2002–03? It will come as no surprise to him if I refer to
                the areas that I represent. St Patrick’s Grammar School,
                Downpatrick, has waited for 18 years; its counterpart,
                Assumption Grammar School, Ballynahinch, is on the waiting list,
                and the rural Mourne area of Moneydarragh is in urgent need of a
                new primary school. How can those specific examples be brought
                into line with rural-proofing and social-inclusion commitments?</p>

                based on educational need. That encompasses the areas of social
                inclusion and equality, and ensures that rural communities have
                access to a network of strong rural schools. The Department of
                Education’s equality scheme provides for the school building
                programme to be subject to an equality impact assessment in the

                Services Board carry out a further assessment of service in only
                the Downe Maternity unit, after it had carried out a risk
                assessment for all the maternity units in the board area last
                year? Why, following that, did it issue further instructions to
                staff on criteria for determining high-risk maternity cases? Go

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All maternity units in the Eastern Board area
                were advised to formalise their criteria for high-risk transfers
                in 1999. Lagan Valley Hospital completed the work in 1999 and
                implemented the criteria for admissions to the unit. I have been
                advised that no further assessment was carried out at the Downe
                Hospital. The Downe maternity unit did not finalise its criteria
                in 1999 and requested an extension until September 2001. The
                Mater Hospital is in the process of finalising its criteria. I
                understand that transfer criteria have been introduced at Lagan
                Valley Hospital and that a revision of risk criteria is nearing
                completion at the Mater Hospital’s maternity unit. Trusts are
                required to review risk assessments in all maternity units
                continually, and the screening of referrals at the Downe
                maternity unit was examined as part of that process.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my main answer, I signalled my clear
                intention that every effort would be made to sustain the current
                service profile of all hospitals, pending decisions made
                following the acute hospitals review. The board and the trust
                have already taken steps to sustain the Downe maternity unit.
                Arrangements involving anaesthetists from Belfast have been
                introduced to maintain a robust anaesthetic service at the Downe
                Hospital, and those are reported to be working well. Five extra
                theatre nurses have been appointed to assist with the 24-hour
                anaesthetic rota, and the training programme for midwives has
                been reviewed so that all midwives are now offered the
                opportunity of advanced life support training.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those measures demonstrate a clear commitment
                to sustaining maternity services at the Downe Hospital — that
                commitment is evident in the work of all the professionals in
                that unit. As a result of anaesthetists’ concerns, in January
                2001 the Down Lisburn Trust asked the board to arrange for the
                high-risk pregnancy group to complete its work on the screening
                of referrals to the unit as soon as is practicable. However,
                that work was undertaken in the context of an ongoing risk
                assessment initiated in all units in the board area in 1999.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is concern in many areas —
                particularly rural areas — about the extended delay in the
                consideration of the Hayes report. Although the consultation
                period has just expired, I urge the Minister to bring forward
                the expected date of the departmental response, particularly in
                the light of the answer that she has just given about the Downe
                Hospital, because the maternity unit and the acute hospital are
                interdependent. The Minister does not seem to understand what is
                happening on the ground, despite a letter sent to her on 4
                October by the Royal College of Midwives. It advised that,
                unless immediate action is taken on the maternity issue, the
                Downe Hospital will be closed, because new criteria introduced
                six weeks ago, without reference to any other Department or
                hospital, will be implemented in Downpatrick with
                discrimination.</p>

                does not cease to exist before the review is completed.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issues involved are far-reaching, as
                illustrated by the many responses to the consultation. They
                affect many people, who have a right to have a say in decisions
                that affect their lives and shape their services. Indeed, the
                major scope and scale of the matters involved are such that they
                go far beyond the remit of my Department, and the way forward
                must be considered by the Executive. Under statutory equality
                duties, the equality implications will be subject to assessment
                and consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Were I to move forward without taking any of
                those steps, I am sure that the Member would be the first to
                draw to my attention the need to do otherwise. Officials will
                now examine and analyse the responses, and the Executive must do
                likewise. We hope that proposals on the way forward can then be
                put out to consultation as soon as possible.</p>

                public or practitioners. Significant work to combat prescription
                fraud is ongoing. For example, points of dispensing checks have
                been introduced, and a dedicated counter-fraud unit was
                established in January 2001 to target the main areas of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Next year the Department intends to introduce
                fixed penalty fines of up to £100, to penalise those who
                fraudulently claim exemption from prescription payments.
                Individuals who have been found to have repeatedly evaded
                payment of prescription charges could be prosecuted and fined up
                to £2,500. Those measures represent a major advance in
                deterring members of the public from fraudulently claiming
                exemption from payment of prescription charges thereby securing
                additional resources for the Health Service.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot tell the Member the precise cost of
                carrying out those procedures. That will depend on how long the
                procedures take and whether the payment is forthcoming
                immediately or has to be pursued through a small claims court,
                for example. It is estimated that in the 2000-01 financial year
                some £9·5 million was lost to the Health Service on account of
                false claims of exemption from prescription charges. During the
                same period, income realised from prescription charges was
                £10·1 million. The annual loss due to prescription exemption
                fraud has decreased from £11 million, in 1999-2000, to £9·5
                million in 2000-01. However, those figures do not reflect the
                full impact of the counter-fraud unit, which became fully
                operational in January 2001.</p>

                in other places that if Members intend to ask a specific
                question as a supplementary they contact the Minister in advance
                so that a reasonable response may be given. It is easy to ask a
                general question, and to then home in on a specific point, but
                there is little purpose in that if a proper answer is required
                from the Minister — and that is the case for any Minister. The
                convention applies not just to Question Time, but in other
                contexts where a specific answer is requested of a Minister. On
                occasion, something unusual will arise, but if it is a Member’s
                intention to ask a supplementary, or a specific question in
                other contexts, the convention elsewhere is to give the Minister
                some notice. That makes an immediate reply a much easier

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The existing rate rebate scheme, as part of
                the social security system, already ensures that the impact of
                rates is lessened for those in the lower income bands, including
                a great number of those on fixed incomes in receipt of state
                pensions. I recognise, however, that many individuals who would
                not necessarily be considered as well off fall just outside the
                parameters of the rebate scheme as it currently exists. The
                review will address that difficult problem directly. The
                question of equity within the system is central to the review
                process.</p>

                the Minister consider compensatory measures for those citizens

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review of rating policy will examine how
                the rating system is structured and how rates are levied. It
                will try to ensure that equity is more strongly reflected in the
                new regime. However, when looking at rate levels, as they are
                levied across council districts, analysis shows that high rates
                tend to occur in district council areas that are more affluent
                while low rates tend to occur in less well-off areas.
                Departments and councils organise and provide services in
                different ways, and therefore there is no means of directly
                relating rates to local services.</p>

                scheme will be canvassed for their views, given that part of the

                injustice and lack of parity in services rendered by trusts?
                This comes about because some trusts stick to their budgets and
                do not create deficits: they achieve this by cutting back on
                services in their localities. Other trusts exceed their budgets,
                create deficits, and give a better service. When does the
                Minister anticipate that action will be taken on this, and when

                in the House previously. The question of the pattern of trust
                deficits, and the fact that not all trusts recorded deficits, is
                one that Members have previously addressed. It is a question
                that the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                and the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                have been interested in.</p>

                of how some trusts have taken steps to avoid deficits, whereas
                others have incurred deficits because of certain pressures and
                demands. Trusts with acute services seem to have had particular
                difficulty in avoiding deficits. That reflects the pattern of
                the pressures that those trusts are under. More detailed

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will be aware that he has had
                representations from the Law Society of Northern Ireland on this
                and that it is not only solicitors who suffer from the
                disruption but mortgage lenders and other financiers too. There
                is a backlog with proof of title for home-buyers in County Down
                especially, where it appears to be worse than anywhere else. It
                would be appreciated if easing that backlog could be speeded up.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the representations from the
                Law Society of Northern Ireland, and the Committee for Finance
                and Personnel has also relayed details of them to me. Not all
                the problems are as straightforward as some of those lobbying
                would suggest. If all the information received by land
                registrars, including information from the legal profession and
                others working in the property field, was accurate, delays and
                time spent on the misplaced activity sometimes involved would be
                reduced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the land registrars appreciate the
                needs of their customers and know that their customers are not
                only those in the legal profession. They have already made good
                some of their commitments in recent months to secure
                improvements in the short term. The focus now is on trying to
                ensure that underlying improvements last for the longer term.</p>

                operating the Barnett formula under the resource accounting and
                budgeting system and discussing them with the Treasury. The case
                for assessing the needs of public expenditure is being examined
                in the context of the six needs and effectiveness evaluations
                being undertaken in Departments. As already stated, the 2002
                spending review sets the context for negotiations on the Barnett
                formula with the Treasury.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think that I have been headed off at the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the future, will he perhaps consider
                publishing a &quot;fool’s guide&quot; to the Barnett formula,
                as it is a complicated and mysterious method of establishing our
                Budget? Can he give more detail on how the change to resource
                accounting and budgeting will affect the formula, and how the
                six needs and effectiveness reviews will be used to support all
                the Barnett negotiations?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think two questions became three; that is
                inflation for you. I wish the Barnett formula would work like
                that and give us more at the end than it started out offering.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To take the last point first, the work on the
                needs and effectiveness evaluations will provide the most basic
                and essential information for any negotiations we have with the
                Treasury. They are aimed at providing a clear and realistic
                assessment of our needs. We need to reflect that clearly in
                negotiations with the Treasury, and to seek a move to funding
                allocations which also reflect that need. In the context of the
                negotiations that we will face, we have to show that we are
                properly addressing the effectiveness issues as well. The needs
                and effectiveness evaluation exercises will throw up questions
                and issues for us as far as our own decisions and allocations
                are concerned, as well as issues that we will want to talk to
                the Treasury about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding the impact of resource accounting
                and budgeting, a significant issue — probably the most
                significant issue in respect of Barnett — is the question of
                capital charges and depreciation costs. Where those have been
                taken account of previously, as part of annually managed
                expenditure, they did not impact on the funds that were within
                our discretion under the departmental expenditure limit. With
                resource accounting and budgeting, they now will.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a very high capital base here
                compared to England. For example, many roads in England belong
                to local authorities and do not count in the departmental
                expenditure limits. Here, they will. Water and sewerage are not
                owned by central government in England and do not count under
                the departmental expenditure limits in resource accounting and
                budgeting. Here, they will. Even on the impact of resource
                accounting and budgeting alone, we have a significant case to
                argue for modification to the Barnett formula.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding the publication of a &quot;fool’s
                guide&quot; to the Barnett formula, we will try to produce
                further information and advice on its operation, not just for
                Members but for wider public interests. People see different
                reports in various magazines and periodicals that slice the
                issue and represent it differently.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree, or will he at least
                consider the possibility, that if the Department of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety were divided in two — one
                Department for health, and another for social services and
                public safety — we could perhaps attract more funding through
                the Barnett formula?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no relationship between the number
                and functional responsibilities of Departments and the Barnett
                formula. I refer again to the point about water and sewerage,
                which do not count towards public expenditure in Britain. What
                we receive from the Barnett formula does not include an
                allocation for water and sewerage, so we have to make provision
                for that out of our own resources. Commitments such as that
                further squeeze the Barnett formula, and for those reasons we
                have to look to what it is we are going to do for ourselves
                through rates and revenue-raising. There is more work for us in
                analysing those issues than there is in restructuring
                Departments or reallocating responsibilities, as that will make
                no impact on what the Treasury allocates to us.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following on from the implementation review,
                one of our public procurement aims is to reduce the transaction
                costs so that we can re-deploy savings into vital areas of
                expenditure, not least to support broader social and economic
                policy. Although the policy of value for money will run through
                all areas of procurement, like letters through a stick of rock,
                it is also possible to achieve other multipliers, not only in
                the Executive’s social and economic policy, but in the
                environmental area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am committed to ensuring that public
                procurement achieves best value for money and also contributes
                to social and economic policy objectives. The workings of our
                procurement policy will support the course of action that we
                take in relation to our valid economic regional objective of
                improving our small- to medium- sized enterprises (SMEs). We are
                concerned about targeting social need, tackling long-term

                a review. Its four aims are: to ensure that current practices
                and procedures for appointment to and promotion within the Civil
                Service facilitate the business objectives of Departments and
                Ministers; speedily to enhance representation in the Senior

                participation by all sectors of the community; and to match best
                practice in other major public-and private-sector bodies. To
                ensure that those aims are addressed, the review team has
                consulted with 39 organisations or groups that represent the
                voluntary and public sectors, as well as the business community.
                That work is almost complete. The organisations and groups
                consulted included Executive Committee members, the Committee
                for Finance and Personnel, the Equality Commission, trade unions
                and other groups identified in section 75 of the Northern
                Ireland Act 1998. There may be further consultation on specific
                measures, depending on proposals that emerge from the review.</p>
