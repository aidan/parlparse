                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Tuesday 26 June Dr Paisley raised a point
                of order regarding language used by the then First Minister
                during a personal statement by the Minister for Regional
                Development, Mr Campbell, the previous day. Dr Paisley asked for
                a ruling on whether the remark was unparliamentary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have examined Hansard and consulted with
                officials on the practice in other places. I believe that there
                was some ambiguity and that the then First Minister attempted at
                the time to correct his remark, but that this was not recorded
                correctly in the Official Report of the debate. A corrigendum
                was issued with the report of yesterday’s proceedings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The use of the word &quot;coward&quot; is
                regarded as unparliamentary in other places, and it seems to me
                that it cannot be regarded as anything different in this place.
                While there may be some question as to whether this is the case
                when it is modified by the adjective &quot;political&quot;, I
                have decided that the word &quot;coward&quot;, whether or not
                modified by an adjective, should be regarded as unparliamentary.
                However, in the absence of a previous ruling on this specific
                term, and in view of the fact that the First Minister attempted
                to qualify his remark, I do not propose to take any
                retrospective action. I emphasise that in future the use of the
                word &quot;coward&quot; will be regarded as unparliamentary
                language, whether modified by an adjective or not, and any
                Member using it will be asked to withdraw it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet again I must take the opportunity to urge
                Members to reflect on the tenor and content of their remarks. It
                does no service to Members or their constituents if business
                cannot be conducted in a seemly manner. I will not hesitate to
                take firm action against any Member who wilfully and
                persistently continues to ignore these directions or any other
                directions from the Speaker. I trust that the matter is clear.</p>

                McGimpsey):</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third North/South Ministerial Council
                sectoral meeting on inland waterways took place in Enniskillen,
                County Fermanagh, on Wednesday 27 June 2001.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following nomination by the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister, Dr Farren and I represented the
                Northern Ireland Administration. The Irish Government were
                represented by Síle&nbsp;de&nbsp;Valera TD, Minister for Arts,
                Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. I am making this report on
                behalf of myself and Dr Farren, who has approved the report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The meeting opened with a progress report
                from the chief executive of Waterways Ireland,
                Mr&nbsp;John&nbsp;Martin. The Council noted that there had been
                disruption to work programmes due to restricted access on
                account of the threat of foot-and-mouth disease but that
                operations are now returning to normal. Since my last report to
                the Assembly, three major projects on the Shannon navigation at
                Limerick, Ballinasloe and Boyle have been completed, opening up
                those venues to boats for the first time. In Northern Ireland,
                work has been carried out to replace the lock gates at
                Movanagher on the Lower Bann navigation, and two public jetties
                at Devenish on Lough Erne have recently been refurbished.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council visited Waterways Ireland’s
                temporary headquarters in Enniskillen and met some of the staff
                there. Overall, 220 professional, technical and industrial staff
                have now been transferred to Waterways Ireland, while a further
                28 administrative staff have been temporarily seconded to the
                organisation. The recruitment process for the directors’ posts
                commenced recently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council approved Waterways Ireland’s
                plans for promotion and marketing of inland waterways. Work is
                progressing on the development of a three-year strategy to
                promote the hire boat sector on the island as a separate niche
                market. A working group has been set up with representation from
                the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, Bord Fáilte and the hire
                boat sectors on both sides of the border to take this forward. A
                new brochure will be published shortly. Waterways Ireland will
                also prepare a longer-term marketing and promotion strategy in
                consultation with the cross-border tourism company, Tourism
                Ireland Ltd and other relevant stakeholders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A promotions advisory group will be set up
                with representation from community, commercial and private user
                groups, as well as the tourism sector. The Council approved the
                setting up of a new marketing and communications directorate by
                Waterways Ireland to deliver these important marketing and
                promotions functions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council received a report on the updated
                feasibility study on the Ulster Canal, which has been carried
                out by ESB International and Ferguson McIlveen. A number of
                options for restoration were assessed, and economic appraisals
                were undertaken. The preferred option recommended by the
                consultants and endorsed by Waterways Ireland is for restoration
                of the canal with six-metre- wide locks along a modified route
                that would link into the River Blackwater at the Lough Neagh end
                and the River Finn at the Lough Erne end.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The updated capital cost for the construction
                works is £89 million at 2000 prices. The construction phase of
                the project is estimated to take about seven years to complete.
                When inflation is taken into account, the final construction
                costs will be significantly higher than £89 million. The
                economic appraisal for the preferred option indicates a net
                present cost of £39 million at 2000 prices, discounting the
                projected cash flows over the estimated life of the project
                using the 6% discount rate currently applicable to UK public
                sector projects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council recognised that there are
                non-monetary benefits that have to be considered. The Council
                noted Waterways Ireland’s assessment of the feasibility study
                report. Now the two Governments must consider the report and
                determine the way forward. An executive summary of the
                consultants’ report will be released to inform and promote
                public debate on the issues involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council approved both the selection
                process for recruitment of the chief executive officer and the
                draft strategic development plan for Foras na Gaeilge.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed to meet again in sectoral
                format in autumn 2001.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Culture,
                Arts and Leisure (Mr ONeill):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement and
                would like to record the Committee’s pleasure that, despite
                some disruption caused by foot-and- mouth disease, a number of
                projects have been completed on both sides of the border. We are
                also glad that staffing levels have improved. Can the Minister
                tell us when Waterways Ireland’s full complement of 380
                employees, which he mentioned recently, will be achieved, and
                when the appointment of directors will be completed?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also good to see that the Council
                visited the temporary headquarters of Waterways Ireland in
                Enniskillen. Can the Minister tell us what stage the
                arrangements for the permanent headquarters are at? I am also
                glad that preparations for the three-year development strategy
                for the hire boat sector are underway. Can the Minister tell us
                the timescale for the completion of these?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is good to see the preparation that is
                being done on the longer-term marketing and promotions strategy
                in consultation with Tourism Ireland Ltd. One of the key issues
                emerging from the Committee’s current inquiry into cultural
                tourism and the arts is that, to date, we have not been as
                effective as we could be in promoting and marketing our

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fortunately, there is no detention at this
                stage. With regard to the report of Ferguson McIlveen and the
                feasibility study on the Ulster Canal, on which the Committee
                welcomes progress, how will the Minister proceed with his
                consideration? How quickly does he expect to arrive at a way
                forward? How does he intend to address the resources issue,
                which the Committee considers to be important, as does the
                Minister?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will respond to as many of these points as
                possible. Staff recruitment is under way. Waterways Ireland
                currently employs 220 staff, has 28 seconded staff, and is
                rapidly moving towards the full complement of 380. There have
                been difficulties, not least suspension, which slowed down the
                rate and process of recruitment. That has prevented Waterways
                Ireland from reaching its full staff complement, although it is
                working as quickly as it can.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I do not have a specific date for
                when Waterways Ireland expects to be fully manned, the process
                is being taken seriously and is being dealt with as a matter of
                urgency. It should not spin out over one or two years. I can
                write to the Member to give him a better appreciation of it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The headquarters will be in Enniskillen, with
                70 full- time jobs. The selection of a site is being undertaken
                by Construction Services, which is acting in an advisory
                capacity to Waterways Ireland. There are seven proposals on five
                sites, from which a shortlist of three will be drawn up. Those
                three proposals will go to a full feasibility study, which will
                include planning. The decision on the final site will be made
                after this process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member mentioned the marketing of
                Waterways Ireland. I cannot give a specific date for that, but I
                can give the Member the chronology as it has built up.
                Water-based tourism is one of the prime raisons d’être for
                reinvesting in and reinvigorating our inland waterways and
                canals. The potential is there, but there is no point in doing
                all this work if we do not promote it and go after the market.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Marketing is a matter for consideration by
                Waterways Ireland, which has decided to appoint a director for
                promotions and is currently in discussions with Bord Fáilte,
                the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the new tourist body,
                Tourism Ireland Ltd. Waterways Ireland is also working with
                local communities and local commercial sectors — boat hire
                companies, for example — and is dealing with the stakeholders
                as they bring forward a promotional strategy for internal and
                international marketing.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An updated feasibility study on the Ulster
                Canal has been conducted, and the cost at 2000 prices is £89
                million. Because of the lifetime of the canal, construction will
                take seven years by traditional methods and with traditional
                funding. The price, therefore, will rise. Roughly half of the
                canal is in Northern Ireland and the rest is in the Irish
                Republic, so the arrangement is for an almost fifty-fifty split
                in relation to finding the capital. There are, however,
                opportunities for attracting private finance into that
                investment, and it is important that we explore those avenues as
                we move forward. There is good business potential in the
                recreation of the Ulster canal system, and I have no doubt that
                private finance can be attracted. We must look at that in more
                depth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are hidden benefits — for example, in
                targeting social need. Canals go through rural areas and areas
                that suffer from low economic activity. The experience in the
                Irish Republic, on the mainland and in Europe is that this type
                of development in such areas greatly enhances local communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are other factors to be considered, but
                the feasibility study is based primarily on the previous study
                for a six-metre-wide canal to allow use by existing boats on
                Lough Erne. That is the next step.</p>

                material? In the past, I have seen brochures produced by the
                Northern Ireland Tourist Board that did not live up to the
                standards expected of a major tourist organisation. Will the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my response to Mr ONeill, I dealt with the
                promotion and marketing of Waterways Ireland. As I said, that
                process is under way. The short-term and longer-term marketing
                and promotion are being looked at with Tourism Ireland, the
                Northern Ireland Tourist Board, Bord Fáilte and the relevant
                stakeholders. I have no doubt that brochures will be produced.
                Waterways Ireland is a stand-alone body, answering to the North/
                South Ministerial Council and, therefore, to the Assembly. I
                have no doubt that arrangements can be made to allow Committee
                input into the promotions strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hear what you say about previous strategies
                not always living up to what had been anticipated. Given the
                history of the last 25 years, it was a difficult sell. Matters
                are now improving greatly. There is huge potential, and, as I
                said in an earlier answer, canals act as economic generators.
                Canals are a benefit to the community as a whole and especially
                to the communities situated close to them.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that three major projects have been
                completed on the Shannon. Are there any major projects for the
                Erne system in the pipeline? I am delighted that the two jetties

                increased pressure from boat traffic coming from the Republic of

                entering the system from the Shannon waterways? Is there a
                monitoring system in place? I ask because of the increased

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Three major projects were completed recently
                at Limerick, Ballinasloe and Boyle. As regards Lough Erne, six
                public jetties at Muckross, Bellanaleck, Magho, Inishdavar,
                Devenish East and Devenish West have been completely
                refurbished. A new floating jetty has been placed on the Lower
                Bann at Toome, and the gates at Movanagher Lough were replaced
                recently. There is an ongoing maintenance and capital programme
                for waterways, and it applies to Lough Erne because Upper and
                Lower Lough Erne are an integral part of the system. Those
                matters are under way as a matter of course.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson asked about projects in Northern
                Ireland. I referred to the Ulster Canal and the upgrade
                feasibility study that is now with us. The executive summary
                will be given to the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee and
                placed in the Library. I announced recently that we are
                conducting a study into the Lagan navigation system. That is
                another major part of the scheme. If the River Lagan navigation
                system were completed, with navigation through Lough Neagh, it
                would connect Belfast, through the Ulster Canal, to the Shannon
                waterways. That is an exciting prospect, offering huge potential

                indicate when the report on the Ulster Canal project will be
                available. We do not want to see another Navan Fort situation or
                the similar problems that are found at many other tourist

                date in view of the major developments that have taken place in
                the Republic compared with the minor works in Northern Ireland?
                Did all completed projects meet their budgetary targets?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have referred to the issues that Mr
                Hilditch raises. The executive summary of the canal report will
                be available to the Committee and will be placed in the Library.
                It reached us last week and will be a matter for discussion
                between the Committee and myself. It is a major project, so it
                is important that the Committee put forward its views.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member asked about completed projects. I
                gave a sense of what has happened. We must understand that there
                has been major investment in canals and inland waterways in the
                Irish Republic over a number of years and that they have a major
                system in operation now. The Republic needs to work on six road
                bridges in order to bring the Royal Canal back into operation.
                That work is beginning immediately. The Republic’s system is
                advanced; the system here is not. As Members know, nothing was
                spent on canals and inland navigation in Northern Ireland during
                the past 25 years. We are starting from a lower base, which
                means that large amounts of capital must be found. That is why
                it is important that Waterways Ireland and the Department, in
                consultation with the Committee, consider the question of
                resources more broadly than just relying on Assembly Budgets. It
                will not be feasible to find the money from the Assembly Budget
                under the current financial restrictions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Waterways Ireland is recruiting a director of
                promotions. The body has also assembled a group of stakeholders
                in the area — such as Lough Erne boat owners, other users and
                local councils — who are looking for help from the Northern
                Ireland Tourist Board, Bord Fáilte and Tourism Ireland Ltd. The
                group wants to promote a strategy, and anyone is welcome to
                contribute good ideas. As I said to Mrs Nelis, I will ensure
                that the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee has an opportunity
                to make a contribution to that process.</p>

                the problem of the proposed development of a footbridge that
                will create an obstacle to navigation on the Newry Canal at
                Scarva? The creation of such obstacles must be avoided if we are

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note what Mr McMenamin said about the
                Strabane Canal and the north-west. To be frank, I must admit
                that I was not aware that there had been a canal in Strabane.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member referred to a footbridge at Scarva
                on the Newry-Portadown Canal, which was an important navigation
                canal in the nineteenth century. That canal is on the list for
                refurbishment. It was an important link to Portadown and was
                part of the network of canals. I had no input into the decision
                on the construction of the footbridge at Scarva. My Department
                was not asked for permission, and it is not clear to me what our
                interest in that was. In examining such matters, we would
                consider it a retrograde step to build a bridge over a canal,
                without allowing sufficient space underneath it to allow for the
                navigation of boats. Questions must be asked about that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I understand it, the Newry-Portadown Canal
                was listed by the Environment and Heritage Service, which may
                have been an extreme step at the time. However, that step would
                seem not to have worked if they have allowed the construction of
                a bridge over the canal that does not permit navigation, even
                though they knew — as everybody does — about the remit of
                Waterways Ireland and the interest of this House in the
                reinstatement of our canal network.</p>

                Cuirim fáilte roimh ráiteas an Aire ar leibhéal amháin ach
                ar leibhéal eile tá mé míshásta leis. I welcome the report
                and the fact that the meeting took place, but, again, I want to
                record my dissatisfaction and protest at the continued unlawful
                exclusion of Sinn Féin Ministers from North/South Council
                meetings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to concentrate on the feasibility
                study on the Ulster Canal and on the crucial matter of
                facilitating and promoting public debate on the issue. I was
                concerned at the comments made by the Member for Fermanagh and
                South Tyrone (Mrs Carson) about the pressure on Lough Erne
                created by traffic from the Republic. I would have thought that
                there would be a universal welcome for visitors to Lough Erne.
                Fermanagh District Council has a progressive attitude towards
                that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When will the executive summary of the
                consultants’ report be released into the public domain? That
                is necessary for meaningful public debate to take place. Further
                to the question asked by the Committee Chairperson, Mr ONeill,
                can the Minister give preliminary details of how that project
                could be financed by the two Governments?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will make the executive summary available
                immediately to members of the Culture, Arts and Leisure
                Committee, and it will be placed in the Library. That will be a
                step forward. We have just received the report, which is very
                technical and comprises several volumes, and we are still trying
                to assimilate it. The executive summary is the first step
                towards doing that, and its contents will be shared immediately.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that we have a public debate
                on the matter, so that people can get an appreciation of the
                importance of the scheme, the economic benefits that will flow
                from the recreation of the canals network, and the potential for
                water-based tourism from which big earnings can be made. Other
                countries that have developed their canal networks have profited
                in that way, and that is the raison d’être of Waterways
                Ireland. It wants to create a network that will attract
                visitors, and we will all benefit from that. We want to ensure
                that facilities such as Lough Erne are used and that visitors
                are attracted to these areas. Mr McElduff may have had made
                another point, but I have answered most of his questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have not yet addressed the issue of
                finance. The study states that the revenue consequences will be
                positive — in other words, once the canal is operational, the
                revenue from it will more than take care of planned maintenance,
                renewals and refurbishment. The capital cost is high — £89
                million at last year’s prices — and we should be a wee bit
                more imaginative rather than simply taking the traditional
                funding route. There are means of attracting private finance
                investment for such a scheme.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister, his Department
                and Lisburn Borough Council on the recent world canals
                conference, which was held for three days in Dublin and one day
                in Northern Ireland. They made an excellent contribution, and
                our officials and Lisburn Borough Council have much to be
                pleased about. It was an excellent few days. I attended the
                conference with the Chairperson of the Committee for Culture,
                Arts and Leisure, Mr ONeill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister aware of the generally held
                view that those employed in the Lough Erne boat hire businesses
                are losing out in the tourism market, principally because of the
                exchange rate? For the most part, tourists are hiring their
                boats in the South before immediately travelling north to Upper
                and Lower Lough Erne. Is he aware — this has been referred to
                already — of the shortage of public jetties and private
                moorings in Lough Erne? That is another handicap for the tourist
                industry north of the border.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister address the matter of
                ownership of the foreshore? The foreshore is the portion of land
                surrounding both lakes that was exposed when, some years ago,
                the water level of the lake decreased considerably. I understand
                that only 9% of the foreshore is owned by adjacent landowners. I
                can only assume that the other 91% is owned by the Crown, and
                that raises questions with regard to Waterways Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister also examine the matter of
                ownership of the bedrock and soil of the lake —the portion
                beyond the foreshore? I draw that to the Minister’s attention
                because the handicaps created by foot-and-mouth disease and the
                exchange rate have this year created additional problems for
                those involved in the boat-hire business in Northern Ireland, on
                top of their existing problems. When those who work in the
                boat-hire industry attempt to develop their own businesses, they
                are being asked to hand over large sums of money for foreshore
                land. Indeed, if we were to go further and try to put a
                breakwater into the lake, the owner of the bedrock would be
                looking for thousands of pounds. Is the Minister aware that
                Northern Ireland boat-hirers are considerably handicapped
                because of that? If not, will he raise the matters with
                Waterways Ireland?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a cost difference between hiring
                boats in the Irish Republic and hiring them in Northern Ireland.
                It is primarily to do with the exchange rate and the disparity
                between the punt and the pound. There are advantages in hiring
                boats in the Irish Republic. However, set against that is that
                fact that anyone who wants to tour that area must drive the boat
                up to Lough Erne. It is a case of swings and roundabouts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not clear about how I could alleviate
                the problem. The exchange rate and the differential between the
                pound and the punt are beyond the responsibility of my
                Department — and, indeed, of the House. It is important that
                we consider what else can be done to compensate other areas.
                First, we must get a sense of the scope of the problem. There is
                always anecdotal evidence of the problem, but Waterways Ireland
                could usefully undertake to establish its size and scope.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been a lack of investment over a
                number of years in jetties on Lough Erne. Waterways Ireland is
                looking at the issue and seeking to make investment. To date,
                six public jetties on Lough Erne have been completely
                refurbished. There is ongoing capital investment in our
                waterways.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that the issue regarding the
                ownership of the foreshore of Lower Lough Erne came about
                because the depth of the water in the lough was lowered some
                time ago, leaving a portion of land between the old and new
                waterlines. My understanding is that the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development owns the bulk of the
                foreshore, although it has sold off some of the foreshore, which
                is now in private ownership. I will ask further questions on the
                matter and get details about the actual ownership of the
                foreshore. I am not clear about who owns the bedrock and the
                soil beneath the water. I will find out and write to the Member.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that the construction costs
                for restoration of the Ulster Canal would rise above £89
                million. Considering that the economic appraisal for the
                preferred option is based on a figure of £39 million, how will
                the Minister ensure that costs are kept down, and how will he
                ensure that the project does not go over budget, inevitably
                creating a drain on the public purse?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What involvement has Waterways Ireland had
                with local businesses to develop tourism? Has sufficient
                discussion taken place with local people, and have the needs of
                disabled been considered?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as Waterways Ireland is concerned, the
                promotion strategy will take stakeholders — specifically the
                responsible tourist promotion bodies — into account. Local
                businesses are important stakeholders, and their views will be
                taken into account. Disability access to waterways is important,
                and over the past 12 months my Department has invested in
                construction work and will continue to do so. There has been
                underinvestment in that area for many years, but the issue now
                takes priority. The cost is £89 million at 2000 prices, but
                that cost will rise when inflation is taken into account.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Against that, because Governments do what
                Governments do, and the Civil Service does what the Civil
                Service does, we must also consider the estimated life of the
                canal, which is 56 years. There is a discount rate for the total
                cost, and we end up with a net present cost. If allowance is
                made for that, for income generated during the construction
                period and for maintenance costs, the net present cost is about
                £39 million, which makes the Ulster Canal unviable. However,
                that does not mean that it should not go ahead. We have
                considered private finance and private investment for the Ulster
                Canal. Economic activity along the canal network, as enjoyed in
                other countries, will be attractive to business and private
                investment. I am convinced that we will not need to meet the
                full amount of capital cost.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must be imaginative and look to the
                market. There are ways and means of doing that. An estimate of
                inflation can be incorporated into the cost, although I cannot
                govern the future. Completing the project on time and on cost is
                a construction management problem, and a proper investigation
                should be conducted to ensure that the work includes everything
                that is required.</p>

                limited knowledge of local history informs me that there has
                been no serious dredging on the Lower Bann since the 1930s. I
                accept the Minister’s suggestion that there will be enormous
                benefits for people on that side of Lough Neagh if the proposals
                go ahead. Can he ensure that the Lower Bann will be shipshape
                for the visitors who will undoubtedly travel further north than
                they have in the past?</p>

                in the same way as other waterways, in that capital will be
                invested as and when it is required or becomes available. Work
                and investment are ongoing, and Waterways Ireland will make

                Roughly half the length of the Ulster Canal lies in Northern
                Ireland, and roughly half lies in the Irish Republic. The
                arrangement, as far as Waterways Ireland is concerned, is that
                we bear the capital costs in Northern Ireland and the Irish
                Republic’s Government bear the capital cost in the Irish
                Republic. Running costs are based on a percentage. Last year,
                our running costs were 9% of the total budget. That percentage
                will vary as more staff are taken on from, for example, the
                Rivers Agency to take on the work of managing the navigations in
                Northern Ireland. Next year, Northern Ireland’s share of the
                budget will rise to 12%.</p>

                of the programme depends on putting in place the final
                arrangements for its implementation. It is vital that that
                should happen quickly. The other substantive item on the agenda
                was a review of progress on implementing the common chapter. We
                also needed to set out a clear programme of work for the summer
                in that area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The chief executive of the Special EU
                Programmes Body (SEUPB) reported on progress made by the body
                since the meeting on 9 April. The report covered a range of
                topics, including progress to date on the selection of
                intermediary funding bodies, the development of local strategy
                partnerships, the current position on gap funding in Northern
                Ireland and accommodation issues. The chief executive advised
                that four local strategy partnerships had been established to
                date and that work was continuing to establish local strategy
                partnerships in the remaining district council areas. The
                Council noted the progress made by the body on those matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council underlined, as it had done at
                previous meetings, the importance of the role of the body, and
                the EU programmes coming under its remit, in contributing to the
                development of peace and reconciliation and maximising social
                and economic benefits on the island, not least in the border
                areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted that between 1995 and the
                end of the current round of structural fund programmes in 2006,
                the European Union will have contributed about 1·3 billion
                euros to North/South programmes. It will continue to play an
                important role in support of the peace process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first paper tabled at the meeting
                reviewed the progress made to date and outlined the next steps
                towards implementation of the common chapter contained in the
                Northern Ireland structural funds plan and the National
                Development Plan for Ireland. That set out a strategic framework
                for building on and developing North/South and wider
                co-operation across a broad range of sectors and activities in
                the context of those plans. The paper highlighted the fact that,
                under the Belfast Agreement, North/South co-operation has been
                placed on a new basis through the establishment of the
                North/South Ministerial Council and the new institutional
                framework outlined in strand two. In this context, the
                North/South Ministerial Council provides a strategic focus for
                taking forward implementation of the common chapter. Moreover,
                the SEUPB has been given a statutory mandate to monitor and
                promote implementation of the common chapter under the direction
                of the North/South Ministerial Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council welcomed as timely a report by
                the two Finance Departments on progress to date in taking
                forward the co-operative actions outlined in the common chapter.
                This report showed that while commitment to implementation of
                the common chapter had been clearly stated, there was a need for
                greater clarity on a number of the issues involved. In order to
                ensure the maximum effectiveness of the common chapter in
                delivering practical benefits both North and South, and to set
                out more clearly the policy and administrative framework within
                which the SEUPB will perform its important role in monitoring
                and promoting implementation of the document, the report pointed
                to the need for a clearly defined action plan to address the
                issues involved. Accordingly, the report recommended the
                establishment of a working group, chaired by the two Finance
                Departments, to review the issues identified and to bring
                forward proposals for action to the next North/South Ministerial
                Council sectoral meeting in this format. The Council noted the
                progress to date on the implementation of the common chapter and
                approved the establishment of the working group as recommended
                in that report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council was advised that the Peace II
                monitoring committee had agreed the programme complement at its
                meeting on 15&nbsp;June 2001 and that this completed the final
                stage of development of the programme. The complement, which was
                prepared by the SEUPB as managing authority for the programme,
                contains detailed information on how the funds allocated will be
                spent. The Council endorsed the approval of the programme
                complement and agreed that it should be sent to the European
                Commission for information, as required by structural funds
                regulation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council also noted with satisfaction the
                progress made to date on the implementation of the Peace II
                programme. The programme complement apart, there are a number of
                associated stages that must be completed to enable full
                implementation of the programme. These include the appointment
                of intermediary funding bodies (IFBs) to deliver elements of the
                programme and the development of the local strategy partnerships
                in Northern Ireland. It was agreed, given the key role that IFBs
                had to play in the delivery of the programme, that priority
                should be given to concluding contract negotiations with IFBs
                and that a deadline of 20 July should be set.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council received an overview on the
                progress to date in relation to spend and closure of the current
                Peace I and INTERREG II programmes. Under EU regulations, all
                funding under both programmes is required to be fully expended
                by 31 December 2001. The Council noted that overall expenditure
                currently stands at 86% for Peace I and 89% for INTERREG II and
                that the SEUPB would provide a further progress report on the
                implementation of both programmes at the next North/ South
                Ministerial Council meeting in this sector. The Council also
                agreed that the body should provide monthly reports to the two
                Finance Departments on the closure of the programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council received a report on progress
                made to date on negotiations involving the two Finance
                Departments, the body, and the European Commission on INTERREG
                III programme proposals. The Council was advised that the
                European Commission’s comments on the draft INTERREG IIIA
                programme had been forwarded to the Northern Ireland and
                Southern authorities in May and that a meeting had taken place
                in Brussels on 1 June involving the European Commission, the two
                Finance Departments and the programmes body.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council was advised that it is planned to
                submit a revised programme to the European Commission by
                mid-August and that it is expected that negotiations on this
                programme will be completed in the early autumn. The Council
                noted the current position of the negotiations and stressed the
                need to ensure that these were progressed quickly so that the
                programme could be implemented on the ground as soon as
                possible. Given the delay in getting this programme up and
                running, the Council indicated that it hoped to hear about
                significant progress in this area at the next North/South
                Ministerial Council sectoral meeting in this format.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council received a report that provided
                an update on the staffing and recruitment position for the
                implementation body. The Council was advised that the SEUPB is
                currently engaged in a recruitment exercise to fill the five
                posts that were approved by the North/South Ministerial Council
                at the sectoral meeting in April and four other posts that were
                approved by the Council in the initial staffing structure for
                the body on 16 June 2000. It is hoped that these appointments
                will be made in the near future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council was also advised that the
                exercise to carry out a full analysis and evaluation of the
                proposed staffing structure for the body was ongoing. Although
                some work remains to be done, it is expected that this will be
                completed by the end of the summer. The Council agreed that in
                the meantime the body could proceed to recruit a further 19
                staff to replace lower-tier staff, within the staffing levels
                agreed in the initial structure, who are currently on secondment
                or who are on short-term contracts with the body. It was
                acknowledged that recruitment of these posts now, followed by
                recruitment of second-tier management posts after completion of
                the full evaluation, would allow for a phased replacement, which
                would avoid any sudden depletion of staff and should assist in a
                more organised transfer of knowledge.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted that the cost of these
                staff would be met from within the approved budget for the body
                and urged the Finance Departments to work with the body to
                ensure that the whole staffing exercise is completed as soon as
                possible.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was agreed that the Council would meet
                again in this format in Northern Ireland in October 2001. The
                exact venue for the meeting has yet to be confirmed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed the text of a joint
                communiqué, which was issued following the meeting, and a copy
                of this has been placed in the Assembly Library.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Finance
                and Personnel (Mr Molloy):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                welcome the Minister of Finance and Personnel’s statement on
                this meeting, which brings us up to date with the European
                programmes. It is important that we move swiftly to implement
                this because of the gaps that have arisen in funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister satisfied that the
                arrangements that have been put in place will allow the funds to
                be drawn down and wholly utilised? When does the Minister plan
                to put the money into use? The report notes the establishment of
                a working group to examine aspects of the common chapter.
                Precisely what issues are to be addressed by this group? Will
                the Minister assure the Assembly that this will not introduce a
                delay in the distribution of funds that are much needed on the
                ground?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I raise the issue of gap funding because it
                is becoming clear that gap funding applications from a number of
                the most disadvantaged areas have been refused, and a number of
                projects have collapsed as a result. Is the Minister aware of
                this? Can he do anything to ensure that the gap funding will be
                put in place to prevent schemes from falling apart?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, why has only 86% of the Peace II
                money been spent at this date?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the Committee’s keen interest
                in the whole area of EU structural funds, not least in respect
                of the Peace programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards a timetable, the fact that the
                programme complement has been agreed by the monitoring committee
                allows us now to take the next step of preparing to call for
                applications for the funding. We also need to complete work on
                the contracts for the intermediary funding bodies, so we are
                working towards seeing the first allocations from the
                Peace&nbsp;II fund being issued in the autumn.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We appreciate that that means we will be
                developing some of these arrangements over the summer. We want
                to take steps to make sure that people are fully informed — as
                people’s patterns are not very regular during the summer —
                but we also share the sense of urgency articulated by Mr Molloy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The work that is to take place on the common
                chapter should not in any way delay any of the necessary work,
                particularly in bringing forward the Peace II programme. The
                cross-border provisions in the Peace II programme are not
                necessarily predicated or dependent on the development of the
                commitments in the common chapter, although we want to bring
                both forward together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report that I referred to in my statement
                identified several difficulties in realising the prospectus that
                is common to both the previous common chapter and the present
                common chapter plans. The working group is trying to recognise
                those difficulties and to find solutions to them. However, that
                should not hold up any of the work that we need to undertake to
                get Peace II on-stream.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to gap funding, it will do no
                harm to remind Members that when we were bringing in the interim
                funding arrangements, groups were lobbying us and saying that
                £3&nbsp;million was needed for gap funding in this financial
                year. The arrangements that we have put in place for the six
                months to October of this year have seen a total of £10 million
                in interim funding being awarded. Therefore the current
                arrangements have provided £10 million in gap funding for that
                six-month period. That compares well with the total of
                £9&nbsp;million gap funding that we issued in the last
                financial year, and it certainly compares favourably with the
                £3&nbsp;million that the lobby groups asked for.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr Molloy said, not everyone was
                successful in those applications. Departments had to make a
                judgement on the basis of Peace II criteria. Decisions can be
                queried and subsequently reviewed. People who have been
                unsuccessful in gap funding applications under these
                arrangements can reapply when the Department of Finance and
                Personnel calls for applications in the new round for the full
                programme. Anyone who has been successful in gap funding
                applications also has to make a full and proper application in
                the new round.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, I will try not to give you the
                problems that you had earlier with an ex-teacher.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister put more meat on the bones
                of the procedures for selection of the intermediary funding
                bodies?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Chairperson of the Finance
                and Personnel Committee, who has already referred to the gap
                funding scenario. Will the Minister inform the House of the
                percentage of groups that have been unsuccessful? The Minister
                told the House, in his answer to Mr Molloy, how much money has
                been distributed, but it would be useful to know the percentage
                of groups that have been successful and unsuccessful. It would
                also be useful if the criteria or scoring system used for groups
                that appeal decisions were made available to all groups, so that
                they could ascertain the likelihood of the success of an appeal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister is aware of particular concerns
                in the Unionist community about the effectiveness of Peace I.
                Can the Minister confirm that those concerns have been addressed
                in the proposed implementation of the Peace II programme,
                together with an increased sustainability requirement? As Peace
                I comes to an end in which there appears to have been some
                back-end loading of projects, which explains the 14% still to be
                distributed, will the Minister assure the House that the end
                monitoring of the entire Peace programme will include a review
                of the effectiveness of Peace I in the Unionist community? A
                front-end loading of Peace II may be required to redress that
                balance.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Members will recognise that there were
                delays in getting aspects of Peace I up and running, which meant
                that the spending rate ran behind in some respects. However,
                steps are being taken to ensure that all spending is completed
                before the end of this year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As well as the lessons taught us by Peace I,
                the Department of Finance and Personnel is trying to recognise
                the issues that the Member refers to concerning uptake of the
                programme. It is essential that all sections of the community
                have an equal opportunity to benefit from the programme. That is
                why — and I repeat this for the umpteenth time in the House
                — under Peace II, horizontal principles have been adopted and
                are inherent in all aspects of the programme, and those
                principles address equality and balance considerations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members of the monitoring committee also
                expressed concerns about these issues. The programme complement
                has been agreed by the monitoring committee not only on the
                basis of some of the commitments given about the programme
                complement, but also because of the significance of the
                horizontal principles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Decisions can only be made on the basis of
                applications received. Applications received from areas or
                groups that meet the criteria will be well favoured. Money
                cannot simply be withheld on the basis that other applications
                were not received. As we know from our experience of Peace I, we
                need to make sure that we have a reasonable allocation and
                reasonable drawdown rates. Members need to look at all of these
                issues in the round.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The local strategy partnerships will be able
                to carry forward many important lessons of the previous
                programme to the intermediary funding bodies (IFBs). Many of the
                issues that involved some differential uptakes as far as Peace I
                was concerned will be well reflected on by local strategy
                partnerships, IFBs and Government Departments in Peace II.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IFBs were appointed using a competitive
                tendering process, as previously indicated to the House. The
                outcome of the process was the subject of a press release and
                was notified to the Finance and Personnel Committee.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister mentioned the 20 July deadline
                for concluding the contract negotiations with the IFBs. Will he
                confirm that every effort will be made to conclude these
                negotiations within the deadline and ensure, in a speedy and
                satisfactory way, that IFBs are ready to do their job, which is
                to feed this money through to help the groups on the ground?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the North/South Ministerial Council
                agreed the deadline of 20 July last week, it was with the
                intention of meeting that deadline. We hope that agreement can
                be reached sooner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We recognise the importance of ensuring that
                the overall programme is implementable. We need to ensure that
                the key position of IFBs, who will be responsible for
                distributing about 34% of the total value of the programme, is
                clearly established. While the tendering process and evaluation
                exercise that took place identified the bodies that should be
                appointed, there are other outstanding issues and some
                contractual points to be sorted out. Those are being pursued,
                not with a view to creating any delays or difficulties, but with
                a view to assisting in certainty and making sure that IFBs are
                best placed to perform their roles in a timely way. They should
                ensure that the managing and paying authorities are in the best
                place to ensure that the rest of the programme complements well
                and properly with those arrangements.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not welcome the statement. It has
                serious implications for the future of this funding as it
                applies to Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know a little about the programme as I,
                together with my two MEP Colleagues, sponsored it originally. At
                first, the Irish Republic wanted to get its hands on this money.
                The three of us were determined that the greater proportion of
                this money would come to Northern Ireland as the people here
                have suffered the most. We said — generously, if I may add —
                that the border counties had been affected by the problems. We
                decided unanimously that there would be money for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new cross-border body is getting its
                hands on all this money. I do not know what legal right it has
                to have anything to do with Peace I or INTERREG II, because that
                was not originally in its agreement, and it was not operating
                when those programmes came about. Ministers have been telling
                people in Northern Ireland that the money has run out. We now
                find out that 86% of the funds allocated for peace has been
                spent and the remainder has not. This money could have been made
                available to those operations that had to shut down. These are
                serious matters, which the Assembly should take cognisance of.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.00</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister saying that all the money
                coming from Europe has to be scrutinised by the joint board?
                What about the money directed specially to Northern Ireland? I
                know that there is not yet a structure in place for monitoring
                the situation — meetings have been called but have not taken
                place. I did, however, attend a meeting with the Minister’s
                party leader, and we had a long discussion about the monitoring
                of the money from Peace II. We need to know how this will be
                structured. Originally the three MEPs nominated two
                representatives to the main monitoring body. I have been
                pressing the Minister for information on what is to happen with
                regard to that but, so far, have not received any. I am
                surprised that it seems to have been delegated to Mr Nesbitt,
                who finds it difficult to organise his diary in order to meet
                the people who should be making representation to him. There has
                been difficulty in getting this matter settled. It needs to be
                settled. The money used to come to Northern Ireland, but it
                seems that the spending and monitoring of it is now in the hands
                of the Irish Republic. That is the key to the whole situation.

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Member bring his question to a
                close?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My question is simple. Mr Durkan and I have
                talked about this matter. I put the question to him personally,
                eyeball to eyeball. I made the situation crystal clear to him,
                and he knows my position. You do not need a dictionary to
                understand what I am getting at.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge fully the insights Dr Paisley
                has as a Member of the European Parliament who was very much
                involved in securing the Peace I programme. That being said,
                there are several misapprehensions under which he is labouring.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, 80% of the Peace II moneys are to be
                spent in Northern Ireland, 20% in the border regions. The
                Special EU Programmes Body is the managing authority for Peace
                II. That is in position and is legal. There is no question of
                anything else being changed or moved in that regard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, we need to be clear about the Peace
                I money and the 86% spend rate. The money has all been
                allocated. The problem is that not all of it has been drawn down
                and spent. Under the European Union regulations, we do not have
                the freedom to decide to spend the money on something else. We
                have to follow the regulations. Money can only be spent within
                the confines of the measures for which it has been allocated.
                Where it is clear that money may not be spent on a relevant
                project, it will have to go to designated reserve projects. It
                is not a case of going to another project that is currently in
                funding difficulties. The regulations and the programmes will
                not allow us to do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the monitoring arrangements
                for Peace II, in case it has escaped Members’ notice there are
                monitoring committees in place. There is a community support
                framework (CSF) monitoring committee as required by European
                regulations, created on a format agreed by social partners and
                others, including local government, arising from the interim CSF
                monitoring committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monitoring committees for the programme for
                building sustainable prosperity and the Peace II programme have
                been set up and are already functioning, having been tasked with
                approving the programme complements. There are five sub-regional
                representatives who give voice to local government interests and
                perspectives on the CSF monitoring committee. They are from five
                political parties, all of which are represented in the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The two programme monitoring committees
                comprise representatives from four parties, including the Member’s
                own party. The Peace II monitoring committee, which is a
                North/South body, and which is chaired by the Special EU
                Programmes Body, includes, for instance, a DUP MLA. Those
                arrangements are in place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley referred to the Northern Ireland
                Partnership Board, which was just one aspect of the Peace I
                programme. It did not monitor the whole programme; it oversaw
                district partnership measures alone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the new programme, we will be setting
                up a Northern Ireland regional partnership board. It will not
                only oversee local strategy partnerships, but will promote,
                foster and sponsor the wider development of partnerships, rather
                than micromanaging the local partnerships. Not least, it will
                try to improve the interaction of Government Departments and
                statutory agencies in regard to the work of partnerships. It
                will also try to build more partnership links between the
                different districts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because it will have a wider ambit, it is
                appropriate that the chairperson of the regional partnership
                board should be from the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister. It will be the responsibility of the two
                junior Ministers. The secretariat for that body will be the
                Special EU Programmes Body. It will be an arrangement particular
                to Northern Ireland, because it is specifically the regional
                partnership board for Northern Ireland. Members should not be
                under any misapprehension that services, arrangements or
                facilities that apply specifically to Northern Ireland cannot be
                provided by the Special EU Programmes Body — it is entirely
                competent.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement.
                However, in common with Dr Paisley, I think that many grey areas
                remain, particularly in regard to the relationship between the
                Special EU Programmes Body and the monitoring committee that has
                already been established in Northern Ireland. Despite the
                Minister’s attempt to outline the relationships, the details
                are still unclear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, have all the intermediary funding
                bodies (IFBs) been identified?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the local strategy partnerships will
                have an important part to play in regard to the Peace II funds.
                Has a deadline been set for the establishment of the outstanding
                partnerships?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am surprised that Mr Neeson, who is a
                member of the CSF monitoring committee, feels that there are
                grey areas. The role of the managing authority, as prescribed in
                European regulations, is clear. The Special EU Programmes Body
                is the managing authority for the Peace II programme. Equally,
                the European regulations set out the role of monitoring
                committees. In this round of funding, we are adhering to and
                applying the criteria for the operation of these committees in
                an effective way. The Peace II monitoring committee is chaired
                by the Special EU Programmes Body. This committee involves
                representatives from the social partners, from local government
                and even from Government Departments, some of whom are members,
                although most attend as advisers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot see where there is a grey area in
                the relationship between the monitoring committee and the body;
                the body is chairing the committee. The committee has agreed the
                programme complement, but it has identified some outstanding
                issues of concern, about which it will want to be satisfied as
                the programme gets under way and develops. The feedback that I
                have received from the two programme monitoring committees, not
                least at the last meeting of the CSF monitoring committee, which
                I chaired in Derry last week, is that people are very impressed
                with how those committees are operating. Their role is much
                clearer and more meaningful than in the previous round.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In respect of IFBs, I refer the Member to the
                answer that I have already given. The tendering process and the
                evaluation exercise have identified appropriate IFBs to cover
                the various measures for which they were asked to submit. That
                list has been identified and is a matter of public information.
                It has also been given to the House. We now want to conclude the
                necessary contractual negotiations by 20 July.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the European Commission’s Northern
                Ireland representative when Peace I was drawn up, I also have a
                special interest in this. I thank the Minister for the regular
                updates on the European programme and funding and how it is
                working. However, it has become clear through the interventions
                of Members that there are many grey areas and a great deal of
                confusion among Members and Committees. If we cannot understand
                how this system works, then the most important people — those
                who are trying to access funding and who are far further down
                the line of receiving information — must be extremely
                confused. What plans does the Minister have to adopt a more
                proactive approach to supplying information on these issues? It
                should not be a matter of statements being issued now and again
                or questions being asked of the Minister. Is he prepared to
                publish a guide to funding for recipients?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Assembly get the opportunity to
                review the programme complement and the common chapter? Members
                would appreciate a debate on the report. That would be a better
                way of letting them have the details. I also want to know about
                other forms of assistance and guidance for groups applying for
                gap funding. What should they do, and which areas should they
                apply for?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I want to ask about INTERREG III.
                The Council was advised of the European Commission’s comments
                on the draft, which is now being revised. Can the Minister
                elucidate that? What did the European Commission not like about
                our proposal on INTERREG III? What changes are being made, and
                will the Assembly be able to see them?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a number of points there. I remind
                Members that information has been given to the House and is also
                available in a number of other forms, including the various
                documents that have been published.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice mentioned the programme complement
                and the common chapter. The common chapter is not part of the
                programme complement, but part of the community support
                framework that was adopted last December. It has been the
                subject of previous questions and discussion in the House and in
                Committees and has been cleared. The common chapter is also
                reflected in the National Development Plan for Ireland.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members — and I am not referring
                particularly to Ms Morrice — ask practically the same question
                each time I make a statement. They do not appear to listen to
                the answers, and then they complain about grey areas. I ask
                Members to consider that and apply it when the documentation is
                published and furnished to them. Many of the representations
                that I receive suggest that many people are &quot;clueing
                in&quot; to some of the arrangements that are in place. In
                particular, the very successful operation of the monitoring
                committees and the commitment of their members has been of great
                assistance in that regard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice rightly made a point in relation
                to communication and information. All the monitoring committees
                have been impressing that since the first day of their
                existence. For example, last week the CSF monitoring committee
                agreed the appointment of a working group to take forward a
                communication strategy precisely in order to make good some of
                the points raised here. Let us remember, however, that because
                of the urgency of getting this programme under way and of
                getting funding on the ground, we cannot wait until there is a
                perfect communication strategy. The SEUPB has been working to
                make sure that a range of facilities will be available for
                people to have information on the programme, on the types of
                measures that will be considered and on the relevant managing
                authorities for those measures. That will now be part of our
                work, as we have completed the agreement on the programme
                complements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As has happened in relation to other
                programmes, the European Commission raised points concerning
                particular aspects of the regulations with regard to INTERREG
                III. The intent of particular issues has been queried, and, as
                INTERREG III is a cross-border programme, part of the
                questioning was to make sure that what was being said meant the
                same thing in both jurisdictions. That was agreed at the last
                North/South Ministerial Council meeting in this format, and I am
                quite happy that we will be able to answer the fairly
                straightforward questions raised by the Commission.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                thank the Minister for his statement and his comprehensive
                responses to several questions. On behalf of the North/South
                Ministerial Council, the Minister underlined the importance of
                the SEUPB’s role in contributing to the development of peace
                and reconciliation and in maximising social and economic
                benefits on the island as a whole, not least in the border
                areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister referred to the Special EU
                Programmes Body’s statutory mandate in relation to monitoring
                the implementation of the common chapter. A number of programmes
                touch on health or education responsibilities. While the
                Minister is not directly responsible, I would like to know how
                he sees that in respect of the continuing unlawful ban imposed
                by David Trimble on the Minister of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety and the Minister of Education. Can the Minister
                advise the Members of any adverse effect of that ban in relation
                to those Departments’ having input into such programmes as
                they come forward?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council recognised that development of
                the common chapter to date has not been satisfactory. There are
                several considerations. There has naturally been preoccupation
                with bringing forward the structural funds programme and the
                Peace programme. The concentration has been on negotiations with
                the European Commission and on working with the monitoring
                committees. Also, the common chapter is incorporated in the
                National Development Plan for Ireland in the South and in the
                community support framework in the North, but not always on a
                like-for-like basis. There are a number of issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The common chapter, as it applies in the
                South, is not confined strictly to EU funding. In the North,
                because it is in the community support framework, it is. There
                are therefore a number of meshing issues that we need to
                resolve. Those are not just between jurisdictions; we recognise
                that there are some meshing issues within jurisdictions as well.
                The working group was set up to try to ensure that we have plans
                for progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no point in having the perfect
                common chapter. The Member will have heard me say before that we
                had the common chapter seven years ago — it was a great book,
                but the movie was never made. This time, we need to ensure that
                we move forward. To develop and implement the common chapter,
                the Special EU Programmes Body needs to have a certain role in
                promoting and monitoring it. However, it would be entirely
                remiss for either the North/South Ministerial Council or myself,
                as Minister of Finance and Personnel here, to say that it is
                entirely up to the body. The body will not be able to monitor
                and promote very much unless the Government make the appropriate
                decisions and have the will to make something of the common
                chapter. That is why the working group is important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Developing and operating the common chapter
                will involve a range of Departments, both North and South. As
                things develop, it might well also involve some of the different
                sectoral formats of the North/South Ministerial Council. To
                date, it has not significantly done so. Any difficulties that
                there have been concerning any of the sectoral formats in the
                North/South Ministerial Council, or concerning the common
                chapter, cannot therefore be blamed on any of the difficulties
                that there were with North/ South Ministerial Council
                appointments. The successful implementation of the common
                chapter will involve a range of different formats, including
                North/South Ministerial Council formats.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the Minister’s statement and,
                in particular, the confirmation of the staffing arrangements
                that are being put in place for the Special EU Programmes Body.
                Can the Minister confirm that that body will continue to receive
                the strong and active support of both Departments of Finance,
                thereby enabling it to carry out its important work in building
                peace and co-operation? Can he also confirm that the people,
                North and South, want to see continued peace-related progress
                being made?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister give a commitment that a
                practical and meaningful common chapter programme of work will
                be formulated and acted upon, thus demonstrating active
                practical North/South co-operation and development along the
                border zone in particular?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member raised several points. I hope that
                it is clear to Members from what I have said that I, Charlie
                McCreevey TD and the North/South Ministerial Council are clear
                about the important role of the Special EU Programmes Body. We
                recognise the work that it has done in establishing itself and
                the necessary lead-in work that it has undertaken to bring Peace
                II on-stream. We are therefore committed to supporting the body’s
                direct practical needs in relation to funding and staffing.
                Again, that was reflected in the statement. The Departments of
                Finance, North and South, and the North/South Ministerial
                Council will want to continue to work with the body to ensure
                that it can discharge its role across a range of programmes in
                the way that it needs to. People should appreciate the
                complexity and diversity of working demands that the body will
                face.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I indicated, we want to ensure that we
                have a work plan for the common chapter that translates it into
                a programme for achievement and delivery, not just a text of
                aspiration. We have to get away from the &quot;it’s the
                thought that counts&quot; approach to these matters. That is why
                we have established the working group and why I look forward to
                having a work plan. I hope that the plan will be not just
                practical, but will have strategic merit. It should indeed
                benefit border areas, but the scope of the common chapter and
                the benefits that it might bring are not confined to border
                areas.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the years, many people have expressed
                concerns about the allocation of funding. What steps will be
                taken to ensure that funding is equally allocated between areas
                that are perceived to be Unionist and those that are
                Nationalist? There has been a large shortfall in funding for
                Unionist areas. Will funding targets be set, and, if so, who
                will monitor them? Will safeguards be put in place to prevent
                shortfalls? Are measures in place to ensure that both
                communities benefit from the programme?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has raised a familiar point.
                First, I refer the Member to my previous answer, when I spoke
                about horizontal principles, including balance and equality. I
                also remind Members that we must operate in accordance with
                section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. Authorities are
                required to pay due regard to the need to promote equality of
                opportunity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An equality impact assessment was carried out
                on the policies in the structural funds plan to ensure that they
                did not directly or indirectly discriminate against or
                disadvantage any group. The assessment also identified the scope
                for enhancing equality of opportunity. Since then, we have
                consulted the Equality Commission and decided to update the
                assessment, in the light of the further refinements that have
                been made to the programme’s priorities and the more detailed
                information that was available in the programme complements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Summaries of the operational programmes and
                details of the programme complements were sent to about 650
                consultees, and some helpful comments were made. We are
                analysing the results of that exercise. The main questions
                related to communications, accessibility and monitoring. The
                programme monitoring committees and the community support
                framework monitoring committee want to see those issues pursued.
                Everyone involved is well seized of those issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot predetermine a certain geographical
                distribution of funding. To do so would be to disregard the
                merit of particular projects or how well they measure up against
                the criteria set out by the Department and the European
                Commission. There would not be much point in negotiating the
                criteria with the European Commission or agreeing the details of
                the complements with the monitoring committees if, at the end of
                the exercise, the project were simply a geographical carve-up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that Members are reassured that all
                necessary steps will be taken to ensure that we fulfil all the
                criteria, objectives and statutory obligations that relate to
                the programme or are derived from the Northern Ireland Act 1998.</p>

                Minister’s statement contains some comprehensive answers.
                However, I have listened to a great deal of negative comment
                from Members about the fairness of the distribution of funding.
                I hope that such complaints will not be used against members of
                my community in this round or to justify allocating funding in
                the opposite direction. The new round allows for single identity
                work. That is a mistake; it allows communities to remain in
                splendid isolation and exclude themselves from working with
                other local communities.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My question relates to the importance of the
                implementation of local strategy partnerships, with district
                councils being well in the running on this occasion. The
                Minister mentioned four local strategy partnerships. Is there a
                resistance on the part of councils to the inclusion of
                partnerships that were previously in place and to people from
                the voluntary sector being stakeholders? If the situation
                changes, how will this impact on the round of funding?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for the welcome he gave to
                my original statement. I hope that the Member’s fears will
                have been allayed by my previous response: allocations will be
                made according to the criteria set down in the details of the
                measures and on the basis of merit. Every effort will be made to
                ensure that people are made aware of the funding and take
                advantage of it and that the application process is accessible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be no discrimination against
                anyone on any grounds. Not only will the authorities that manage
                the measures ensure that that is the case but the monitoring
                committees will also want to be satisfied that there is no
                discrimination, as will the European Commission, which attends
                committee meetings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sean Neeson put a question earlier about
                local strategy partnerships. Although I answered several of his
                questions, I omitted to answer that one. At the North/ South
                Ministerial Council sectoral meeting it was reported that four
                local strategy partnerships had already been established.
                Judging from the feedback that we have received, it looks as if
                a number of local strategy partnerships will be established.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where the establishment of local strategy
                partnerships has been agreed within two months of the programme
                complement’s being agreed, 22 June, those partnerships will be
                entitled to receive their allocation of moneys under priority
                three. If agreement has not been reached on the establishment of
                local strategy partnerships, the existing district partnerships
                in those areas will receive 25% of the funding under priority
                three. The allocation of the remaining money will be determined
                when agreement is reached.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure Members that while there have been
                some misunderstandings and misgivings about the changing nature
                of the scope of partnership at district level, most people, not
                least those in the community and voluntary sectors, have been
                reassured of our aims.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, we want to extend the scope of
                partnership and thereby extend the leverage of interest that
                those involved in partnership will have. Secondly, we are trying
                to extend the life cycle of partnership and make it more
                sustainable so that it does not perish when Peace II moneys run
                out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Councils are being asked to play a more
                corporate role in the new partnership arrangements. This is not
                to allow them to muscle in and dictate to the partnerships but
                rather to ensure that the corporate work of councils is informed
                and influenced by the strategic thinking of the partnerships.
                Equally, the local statutory agencies must be involved, and we
                want to ensure that these agencies work their passage on the
                partnerships to a greater extent than they had previously done
                in Peace I.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That will involve negotiations at local
                level. Fifty per cent of the partnerships will represent
                Government, including statutory agencies and local government.
                They will determine the balance themselves. The remaining 50%
                will involve social partners, the four pillars of which are the
                community and voluntary sector, the business sector, the trade
                union sector and those with agricultural or rural interests.
                Among the details being ironed out are the precise numbers and
                configuration rather than wholesale issues of principle. I am
                not aware of any difficulties or resistance from local
                government.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Regional Development (Mr
                Campbell):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for granting me
                time in the busy schedule of the House to make a statement on
                the review of my Department’s winter service activities. I
                realise that it is a rather unseasonal topic, given that it is
                the height of summer, but it is an important issue, as indicated
                by the high level of interest among public representatives and
                the public.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members might recall my statement to the
                House in January 2001 following the heavy snowfall of Christmas
                week, the heaviest since 1982. I announced that I had
                commissioned a review, with a final report to be completed by
                the end of June, so that the proposals could be effectively
                implemented in time for winter. A second heavy snowfall occurred
                at the end of February, and this was also considered in the
                review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review was undertaken by a team of senior
                Roads Service officials and outside experts, including Mr Mike
                Moore, director of environmental services for North Yorkshire
                County Council, in whose area snow frequently falls on the high
                moors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for the comments and advice of
                the Regional Development Committee, which met team members on 17
                January 2001 at the start of the review and again more recently,
                when it heard the preliminary recommendations. Members of the
                Committee who have seen the detailed presentation of the review
                findings will agree that the review has been very thorough and
                has taken proper consideration of the issues raised by Members.
                It has been very worthwhile.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most people believe that in exceptional
                winter conditions some disruption is to be expected, but there
                is always scope for improvement in our handling of those events.
                I am pleased that the Roads Service has drawn on the experience
                of last winter to develop better procedures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the key points highlighted in the
                review is the need for a different approach to tackling heavy
                snow, by contrast to the routine salting of ice and frost. For
                example, during normal icy conditions, salt is sprayed at a rate
                of around 20 grams per square metre, and a gritter carries
                enough salt to cover the entire route. A gritter travels in one
                direction but spreads salt over both lanes, so the average
                treatment time for a route is approximately three hours.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By contrast, during heavy snow, salt has to
                be spread at twice the normal rate, and the gritters have to
                return to depot in mid-route to replenish. They also need to
                plough in both directions, and it can take more than a day to
                clear heavy snow from the standard network. The review makes
                several recommendations for addressing those difficult
                conditions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first recommendation is to increase
                snow-clearing capacity by adapting normal lorries to carry
                snowplough blades. The second is the phasing in of
                quick-mounting kits to cut the time needed to fit snow blades to
                vehicles. The third is to ensure that the workforce has regular
                training and practice in snow-clearing activities. The fourth is
                the prioritising of snow-clearing routes so that in extreme
                conditions the most important roads are tackled first. Finally,
                the review recommends enlisting the help of other agencies, such
                as district councils, to help clear busy town centre footpaths
                in periods of prolonged lying snow, and employing contractors
                and farmers to help clear snow from local roads using their own
                equipment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review also looked at procedures during
                normal frost conditions. As a public representative, I realise
                that many motorists greatly appreciate the salting service
                provided in times of ice and frost, so much so that there is a
                great demand to extend the normal salted road network. However,
                we must be practical, and we must carefully consider the
                resource implications. The salted road network comprises 28% of
                all roads and covers 80% of the traffic, because it targets
                busier roads. That amounts to over 4,200 miles of roadway, which
                is equivalent to twice the distance from Belfast to Moscow. This
                length of roadway is treated in just over three hours. It is a
                massive undertaking.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review found that Northern Ireland has
                the greatest length of salted road network per head of
                population of any region in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
                It is equal with Scotland, where winters are more severe, and is
                more than twice the average in England. Some of my officials
                said that we are &quot;at the top of the league&quot; in the UK.
                We should be trying — and I will be endeavouring — to win
                the European Champions’ League, rather than simply being the
                UK league champions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also must remember that RUC statistics
                show that frost, ice and snow are a factor in only 2·5% of all
                road injury accidents. Less than 1% occur on roads outside the
                normal salted road network. Extending the salted road network is
                not the best way of achieving a targeted reduction in road
                casualties. To do that, we would be better spending resources on
                proper funding for road maintenance, which would improve the
                wet-weather skidding resistance of road surfaces throughout the
                year, not just in winter, or increasing the allocation for the
                accident remedial and traffic-calming programmes. The
                traffic-calming programmes have a proven track record of cutting
                accidents by 40%. I am sure that Members will recall my recent
                announcement in the House about the increase in traffic-calming
                programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A modest increase in the salted road network
                is, however, justified. It currently includes roads carrying
                more than 1,500 vehicles per day, or 1,000 vehicles per day in
                hilly areas. I have accepted the review team’s recommendation
                to increase the weighting for buses in service. For example, a
                40-seater bus would be counted as 40 vehicles for the purpose of
                the criteria. I have also accepted the recommendation that each
                small settlement that has more than 100 dwellings within its
                area plan boundary should have a salted road link via the
                shortest route to the current salted road network. While precise
                routes still have to be worked out, we estimate that it will
                increase the salted network by up to 4%. Members may ask for
                more, but we already sit at the top of the UK league, and to do
                even more salting would inevitably mean doing less of something
                else. The number of people coming forward with suggestions for
                that has been remarkably small.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During conditions of prolonged ice or snow,
                Roads Service will also be taking a more flexible approach to
                requests for salting routes outside the salted network on a
                one-off basis. Other measures coming out of the review include
                earlier target times for completing morning salting runs to
                match the start of morning peaks on the main commuter routes,
                which are creeping forward year by year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, a new communications strategy is
                being developed, which will see an improved winter service
                leaflet being more widely distributed. In addition, Roads
                Service is developing systems so that real-time information on
                salting activities can be relayed electronically to the
                broadcast media. This will mean that motorists listening to
                breakfast radio can be kept up to date with road conditions and
                salting operations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have accepted the recommendations of the
                review team and asked Roads Service to implement them as far as
                possible for the coming winter. These measures will have a cost.
                In an average winter, that could be up to £0·5&nbsp;million
                over and above the typical expenditure, which has been around
                £4·5&nbsp;million per winter. In a severe winter, the cost
                will be much greater. However, my Department has not allowed
                cost restraints to impact on its response to emergency
                situations. That was demonstrated last winter, when we spread
                almost 75,000 tonnes of salt — 60% more than the average —
                and spent £1·2&nbsp;million more than the normal budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the wide level of interest in
                winter service operations from all sections of the House will be
                remembered when consideration is given to my Department’s bid
                for additional winter service resources in the appropriate
                estimating rounds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for the opportunity to make
                this statement to the House. I hope the House will agree that
                the measures I have announced today will help my Department to
                meet its main winter service objective, which is to help main
                road traffic move freely and safely in wintry conditions by
                spreading salt at the most effective times.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                Regional Development (Mr McFarland):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement and
                thank him for his discussions with the Regional Development
                Committee last week on this issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly, we cannot grit all our roads, and
                there are substantial parts of the Province where minor roads
                fall outside the gritting schedule. Will the Minister consider
                encouraging local farmers to grit stretches of the road? Will he
                also consider placing strategic piles of grit in certain places
                on those roads that are not part of the gritted network, and
                encouraging local firms or farmers to help spread that grit?
                That would ease the load and the cost to the Department.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Deputy Chairperson for the
                positive nature of his comments. The review team considered the
                option of using farmers to help with normal salting operations.
                Consideration was given to it, and I will briefly outline why it
                was not pursued.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, it would significantly increase the
                amount of salting and, therefore, the cost. Salting in that
                rather piecemeal way would be less efficient and more expensive
                than using a larger-capacity gritter. Secondly, there would be
                problems of command and control in contacting the farmers to
                tell them when to grit. There would also be the likelihood of
                discontinuous treatment, with roads being salted for a few miles
                but then the treatment being discontinued without any warning to
                motorists. That would create obvious problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There could be a significant response problem
                were we to employ persons who did not prove to be as reliable as
                others. If, through illness, or some other reason, they were not
                able to turn out, there would be an assumption that a road had
                been gritted when in fact it had not. That would be totally
                unacceptable to motorists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The option of trying to get farmers to assist
                is an attractive one, but these reasons make it very difficult
                in the normal course of events to use them. As I said in my
                speech, the Roads Service at divisional level will be
                advertising, prior to this winter, to offer a standby contract
                to applicants who have suitable equipment and insurance.
                Farmers, as well as other contractors, will be able to apply for
                those positions.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an excellent statement, without any
                mention of the rocky road ahead. I share the Minister’s view,
                expressed in his statement, that it has been a very thorough
                review. It has certainly gone into great detail. I have just a
                few points.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the issue of the volume of traffic that
                determines the gritting criteria, I welcome the change from
                1,500 vehicles per day to 1,000 vehicles per day, but I am not
                completely satisfied. My long-held view is that the figure
                should relate to a given number of vehicles in any hour of a
                24-hour period. The term &quot;morning peaks&quot;, as used in
                the Minister’s statement, perhaps reflects my line of
                thinking.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are you coming to your question, Mr Bradley?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here it is, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is my
                understanding from last week’s meeting with the Department’s
                officials that the intention was to ensure that at least one
                route to and from rural schools would be gritted or cleared to
                prevent school closures during severe weather. Will the Minister
                confirm that my understanding is correct?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his broadly positive
                response. I will just establish the criterion for him. It has
                been 1,500 vehicles per day. I understand, however, the
                rationale that says that there may be a specific number of
                vehicles using a route at a precise time and that for the
                remainder of the day it might be relatively underused. There are
                difficulties in trying to establish the number of vehicles at a
                precise moment in a day. The normal practice has been to
                establish a 24-hour day in which a particular number of vehicles
                use a road.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are major problems in establishing a
                precise time at which a significant number of vehicles are using
                a road. If we were able to do that, it would show that
                significantly more roads had significantly more cars on them at,
                say, 9.00 am — school time. We would then be back to the
                resource implications of trying to cover more roads, with
                significantly greater costs. The criterion is 1,500 vehicles per
                day, but in hilly areas, mountainous regions or in other
                difficult circumstances, the criterion is 1,000 vehicles per
                day. The change that I have made gives greater weighting to the
                buses that are using lesser- used roads. Previously, a lesser
                weighting was given to buses using such roads. That should bring
                more roads into the salted network.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of minor roads to schools was
                looked at in the review. I hope that, as a result of the
                recommendations, small settlements — those with more than 100
                dwellings within an area plan boundary — will have a salted
                link road to the salted route network. Therefore, even if they
                are in an area that is not close to a salted route network,
                there will be a road that will connect them to it. In that sense
                there will be a salted route between small settlements, schools
                and the overall salted network.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that the Minister has accepted
                the review’s recommendations on this issue. People in west
                Tyrone will particularly welcome his comments about small
                settlements. It is vitally important that they be connected to
                the major salted routes in case of emergencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is another issue that I am concerned
                about. There are many salt and grit boxes in rural areas. During
                times of normal frost — I am not talking about heavy snow —
                there is sometimes excessive use of grit in the mornings, the
                supply becomes depleted, and nobody seems to replenish it. In
                order to deal with, for instance, a five- or six-day spell of
                frost, there needs to be adequate replenishment of grit. Also,
                what is being done with regard to village and town footpaths?
                The greatest numbers of personal accidents happen during frosty
                periods.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My last point concerns the suitability of the
                equipment used to move the snow to the side of the road. It can
                cause more problems. Many of the snowploughs push the snow into
                farmers’ lanes, and you can end up with lanes jammed and roads
                that nobody can access. Can we ensure that the equipment used
                pushes the snow right off the road and does not jam the lanes
                along the route?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member raised a number of issues, and I
                will try to deal with each of them. The availability of salt
                from depots was looked at during the review. One of the problems
                was that there seemed to be some representation to allow the
                public access to the depots to acquire salt to be used on roads
                outside the salted network or on farm lanes. That would have
                safety implications at a very busy time in the depots. With
                large gritters and loading shovels manoeuvring and reversing,
                there would be the possibility of accidents and claims arising
                from that. The safety of the public in the depots would have to
                be taken account of. The outcome of the review is that at the
                moment, salt boxes and grit piles are provided near to the
                points where they are most needed. One of the lessons learned
                from last winter is that those boxes and grit piles must be
                regularly replenished throughout frosty and snowy weather. The
                Department will endeavour to do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know from Members’ representations to me,
                and having made representations myself with regard to footways
                in Coleraine over the Christmas period, that there can be severe
                difficulties in pedestrian zones and on footways. However, it is
                at that time that Roads Service resources are stretched to the
                limit in trying to keep the main traffic routes open.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the first services to be stopped on
                occasions of severe weather conditions is the refuse collection
                carried out by district councils. In that case, district
                councils might be able to assist by spreading salt on busy town
                centre footways; Roads Service will gladly supply them with salt
                to do so. Some councils have expressed an interest in assisting
                in that way, and Roads Service will be in touch with all
                councils before next winter to see if local agreements can be
                reached to secure that assistance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson’s final point related to Roads
                Service’s capacity to move snow without leaving it in another
                location where it can block access to and from lanes or minor
                roads. That point was addressed in the review. As I said
                earlier, staff will be trained in the fastest and most efficient
                way of loading the devices to clear the snow, and in the best
                and most efficient method of moving it from the roadway.</p>

                not think it at all unseasonal. It is proper that a review of
                the winter services take place and that the recommendations be
                put in place now; they should be implemented prior to the winter
                season rather than when the first severe weather warning is
                announced. I particularly welcome the recommendation to have a
                communication strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When priority roads have been cleared by
                snowploughs during prolonged snow cover, will the ploughs then
                be deployed to clear the lesser-used roads? The review also
                recommended that contractors and farmers should be employed and
                involved in clearing snow in local areas. Does the Minister
                anticipate that the necessary advertising, recruitment and
                contracts will take effect in time for the forthcoming winter?</p>

                Communication to motorists in the mornings when they begin their
                journeys is particularly important. It is important for them to
                know if a road has been cleared or is likely to be cleared in
                the immediate future. That is fundamental, and it is hoped that
                it will be of considerable assistance this winter.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said in my statement, the salted network
                comprises 28% of the road network in Northern Ireland. That 28%
                represents the most heavily travelled routes, and therefore some
                80% of the traffic. Where there is snow and frost to such an
                extent that the main roads, which carry that 80% of traffic, are
                severely affected — and this happened last Christmas — Roads
                Service will concentrate on those roads and on that network.
                Once the salted road network has been cleared — either due to
                the efficiency of Roads Service or a slight improvement in
                conditions — it may be possible to try to clear minor roads
                that are not part of the network. Flexibility in the system will
                allow Roads Service to do this on a one-off basis, although
                there will be resource implications. The more often we do it,
                the more often we will exceed the amount of money allocated for
                winter service operations, which at the moment is just under £5
                million, and the more often I will be coming back to the House
                to try to get additional moneys.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Trying to ensure that rural communities are
                not cut off is an issue that concentrated the minds of those on
                the review team. Undoubtedly, it will be foremost in the minds
                of all Roads Service officials this winter. I hope and expect
                that all communications and advertising will take place before
                winter comes so that the entire community will be aware of the
                position.</p>

                stretching from urban Newtownabbey to the slopes of the Colin
                Mountain and Elliot’s Hill in the north, and the boundary
                between south Antrim and Ballymena. It was in that area over the
                recent winter that the farming and rural community was, as we
                say in the country, &quot;blocked in&quot; for a period of
                almost four days. When I eventually got to the area I found that
                a subcontractor had been trying to open roads over a large rural
                area. He appeared to have only two small pieces of machinery. He
                was not —</p>

                resources in a situation such as this? The resources available
                then were not able to cope with the situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have seen the technology that is now in
                place, and I hope the Minister will accept that, last year, the
                one thing for which he was criticised more than any other was
                for being caught on the hop. If the Minister has the technology

                there was going to be snow. However, we went out on to our roads
                the next morning to find that apparently Roads Service had not
                been in attendance.</p>

                constituency and the subcontractor on board. I will not go
                through the guided tour he gave me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I expect that the training that Roads Service
                staff will undertake will be completed by winter. They will be
                in touch with subcontractors such as the one Mr Wilson
                mentioned. They will be aware of the best way they can operate
                in the winter and of the best and most productive way they can
                ensure that designated roads are cleared. I hope and expect that
                the first-hand training given to Roads Service staff will be
                passed on to subcontractors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other issue is the extent of the
                snowfall. I am glad that Mr Jim Wilson used the word
                &quot;apparently&quot; in his question just now. I agree with
                him that a person rising in the morning and seeing a road
                covered in snow or frost would naturally assume that it had not
                been salted. It is not always an accurate assumption, because
                the road could be salted or gritted and then there could be a
                further snowfall. Given the extent of the salted road network
                — over 4,000 miles, which has to be covered in less than three
                hours — it is possible that roads could be salted and
                subsequently frosted over. It is difficult to salt roads in such
                a way that everyone can find the network clear, with no snow
                having fallen in the 30 minutes or 45 minutes since the roads
                were salted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review was carried out to make the best
                scheme in the UK a better scheme. As I said earlier — somewhat
                tongue in cheek — while we are the best in the UK, I want us
                to be the best in Europe. The Champions’ League is what we
                want.</p>

                Regional Development Committee made a meaningful contribution to
                that review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did Roads Service consider salting at least
                one route to each school, particularly those in rural areas
                where there is great concern each winter about public safety?
                People in rural areas would appreciate that.</p>

                Committee already. I thank the Committee for its help and
                assistance in considering the outcome of the review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review considered rural schools. The
                difficulty is that there is usually more than one access road to
                each school. The problem — without going into specific detail
                — is that if a particular route between the salted road
                network and a small rural school were to be salted, then people
                living on the wrong side of the salted minor road would have to
                make additional journeys. Such people might have to go several
                miles in order to get to the salted minor road, thereby
                increasing the possibility of motorists believing that they were
                encountering more risk.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, while the review looked at the
                possibility of salting a minor road between the salted road
                network and a rural school, it was simply not possible to do it
                in a way that would minimise journey time. If it were possible
                to achieve this, we would look at the situation again. If
                Members know of specific roads that could be salted and that
                would not disadvantage a number of parents leaving children to
                school, then I will look at such a situation.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last winter the minor roads in these hilly
                areas, which are served by four or five bus routes, were taken
                off the gritting schedule. Although I welcome the Minister’s
                statement and what he is trying to do, he does not go far
                enough. These minor roads should be prioritised before death or

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have outlined the resource implications
                before, and I tried to do so again today. For example, if I were
                to increase the percentage of traffic covered by the salted
                network from the existing 80% to 90%, it would costs several
                million pounds. If I were to try to cover 100%, which most would
                accept as being virtually impossible, it would cost many
                millions of pounds. It is therefore a question of devising a
                mechanism to treat the maximum mileage of road and accommodate
                the maximum number of vehicles on the salted network within the
                resources available to me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the concerns about rural areas,
                and it is about these areas that Members speak most
                consistently, but in practical terms they have the lowest
                density of traffic. Today I announced a change in the weighting
                to be applied to buses — for example, school buses. This will
                increase the number of minor rural roads included on the salted
                network. As I said, for the purposes of the criteria, a
                40-seater bus is counted as 40 vehicles. That ought to mean that
                a greater number of small rural roads on which school buses take
                children to rural schools will become part of the salted route
                network. However, it would cost several million pounds to cover
                every eventuality for every rural school on every rural route.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past I have made bids for additional
                funding for winter maintenance, but unfortunately they have been
                unsuccessful. However, I will continue to bid for an increase in
                the amount of resources deployed for winter service.</p>

                in the near future, in the light of the correspondence that will
                flow from the Roads Service to each of the 26 district councils.
                I do not want to go into specifics, but most interested
                observers will see the practical difficulties encountered by
                councils when there is substantial snowfall. In times of heavy
                snowfall, the refuse collection service is usually reduced
                considerably or stopped.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be a positive and productive use of
                council staff’s time if it were possible, between Roads
                Service and local councils, to devise a system to deploy that
                labour to clear footways and pedestrian areas. Roads Service and
                councils will discuss that in some detail before any agreement
                is reached, but the communication between them will be under way
                within a few months — well in advance of the winter.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy referred to how farmers can be
                included. I said earlier that there will be a standby contract
                with applicants with suitable equipment and insurance. That will
                almost exclusively be in rural areas, where they are required
                because the roads are outside the salted route network. Farmers
                and other contractors will be entitled to apply, and I encourage
                them to do so. When they do, and the successful applicants are
                ready to begin, they must be suitably trained in the use of the
                machinery in order to get the maximum efficiency from the post.</p>

                in a co-ordinated way so that there is no repeat of last winter’s

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assume from the Member’s comments that
                the road that he mentioned is on the salted route network. It is
                obvious that, in extreme conditions, there can be difficulties
                in keeping even the salted route network open. However, any main
                road on the salted route network — whether it is cross-border
                or not — is a priority route, and resources are deployed to
                keep it clear. The principle that I have announced will also
                apply on other roads — again, cross-border or not — outside
                the salted route network. Where the salted route network is
                clear and resources allow Roads Service to try to clear other
                roads on a one-off basis, resources will be deployed to keep
                those roads clear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I intend that the roads that carry 80% of
                traffic, whether internal to Northern Ireland or cross-border,
                will be kept clear. The review is designed to achieve that
                objective. I hope, and confidently expect, that that will be the
                case.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review has pinpointed a number of
                problems. I want to ask the Minister about information that is
                available to the public. On many occasions when there has been a
                severe winter or overnight snow, there has been a lack of
                information to the public, and especially motorists, about which
                roads are blocked and the timetable for clearing them. I want
                the Minister to take the point about how the public is informed
                of road conditions when there is a heavy snowfall.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said in response to a previous question,
                I have taken a particular interest in this issue. Of all the
                aspects of the review, this can go the furthest in assisting
                members of the public. The possession of information about
                whether roads are blocked or clear will assist them in making
                decisions about their journeys. That is why I want to see —
                and will expect to see — the communications strategy in place
                in advance of the winter service leaflet being more widely
                distributed. We now have a whole network in Northern Ireland of
                major broadcasting stations and minor commercial radio stations.
                Many people tune in to those on car radios, or at home before
                leaving. If we can get real-time information to motorists or
                potential motorists, that will greatly assist them in their
                journeys.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By way of a caveat, I must add that the
                weather enters the equation. For example, even if at 6.45 am a
                local radio station — wherever it might be in Northern Ireland
                — indicates that a particular road is clear, there may well be
                heavy snow at 6.55 am. That would, of course, mean that the
                information that people received 10 minutes previously was
                obsolete.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a difficulty. There is no precise
                scientific answer to this question. However, in general terms,
                the communications resource, if used properly, can go a
                substantial way to being of significant assistance to all
                motorists, particularly in very severe wintry conditions.</p>

                I have to welcome any review which might improve the situation
                regarding roads in the winter. Looking at the situation last
                year — or in any year — quite often in rural areas, heavy
                snow means that everything stops. It can even happen in cities,
                as was the case on one particular day last year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is welcome that the figure of 1,500
                vehicles per day has been reduced to 1,000. Is the latter figure
                based on urban areas rather than rural areas? If so, areas such
                as Fermanagh or Tyrone would have only a very small length of
                minor roads gritted or salted. That is a difficulty. We have
                some link roads between main roads that are used a lot by heavy
                lorries, although perhaps not by school buses. There are
                difficulties with the surfaces of particular roads —</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My question is being asked in context. Is
                there a possibility that roads within striking distance of the
                criterion of 1,000 vehicles could be included at some point?
                They are particularly difficult at a local level.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the roads outside the salted network
                are in rural areas, because rural areas are, for the most part,
                less populated than urban areas. Those roads falling outside the
                salted route network are therefore almost exclusively rural
                roads. The criterion of 1,000 vehicles per day refers to areas
                of mountainous or hilly terrain. I should elaborate on the
                matter of buses, particularly in relation to rural schools.
                Where a number of buses use lightly travelled routes, each
                40-seater bus counts as 40 vehicles towards meeting the
                criterion. Each year, Roads Service staff review the roads
                network to identify roads that may be coming close to entry into
                the salted network.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem is that if Roads Service were to
                make roads that carry 900 or 950 vehicles per day a point of
                reference, next year MLAs and councillors would say that there
                are roads that carry 800 or 850 vehicles per day, a figure that
                almost meets the 900-vehicle benchmark. That would bring us back
                to the resource implications. Therefore there are difficulties
                and problems, but there is also flexibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For a further year, sympathetic consideration
                will be given to winter gritting of those roads that currently
                come close to the 1,000-vehicle-per-day criterion in hilly
                areas. In the following year, the number of vehicles on those
                roads may increase slightly, with the total coming close to or
                exceeding the 1,000-vehicle-per-day criterion. If that happened,
                the road would be placed on the salted route network.</p>

                statement, which deals with an issue that needed to be addressed

                tell me whether all bus routes to rural schools will be gritted?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will try to be as clear as I can and
                clearer, obviously, than I have been. Every rural road that
                meets the criteria will be salted. Rural and urban roads are on
                the salted route network if they meet the criteria. It follows
                that if they are not on the salted route network, they do not
                meet the criteria. The outcome of today’s statement will be to
                increase the number of roads on the salted road network. I admit
                that the increase will be marginal, but given the resources at
                my disposal it is difficult to see how it could be otherwise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is concerned about rural schools.
                In the case of small rural roads in areas that do not meet the
                criteria, the Department is endeavouring to look at small
                settlements in those rural areas with more than 100 dwellings
                within the area plan boundary and to provide them with a salted
                road link via the shortest route to the current salted network.
                That will not automatically mean that every rural school has a
                salted road leading to it. However, rural roads that meet the
                criteria will be salted.</p>

                steep and difficult to negotiate. I listened to the responses

                will miss it. Some months should elapse between today and the

                maximise local media coverage through radio stations, television

                survey office, where they will, I hope, be given a résumé that
                shows exactly how each of the district council areas is covered
                and how the reports are sent in on a frequent basis throughout
                the day. Those reports mean that at any given time, engineers
                across Northern Ireland are aware of the temperatures throughout
                Northern Ireland, the depth of any snow and the potential for
                more snow and frost. During the very bad weather last winter, I
                went to the office to get a report. I heavily recommend that
                Members do that — or rather I &quot;actively&quot; recommend
                it; otherwise Members might think that I am talking about
                snowfall. They will see the extent to which Roads Service goes

                long-term effects on the roads? If there is, how much money will
                be coming out of the Minister’s budget to repair those roads?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is talking about the unfortunate
                corollary of the steps that I have proposed. Taking a
                dispassionate view, the money that is required to salt the roads
                for two years would build a bypass. Using salt on the salted
                route network does have an effect on the roads, and that has an
                impact on the maintenance budget throughout Northern Ireland.
                However, given the pressures that we face and the demands from
                the community regarding the extent of the salted route network,
                it is a very finely balanced judgement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my statement I said that 75,000 tonnes of
                salt were spread last winter. That does have an effect on the
                structure of the roads, but we are also under pressure to ensure
                that the roads are made as safe as possible to travel on during
                extreme weather conditions. The downside, as Mr Davis says, is
                that that has a cost effect that, unfortunately, is reflected in

                However, over the past few years I have received several
                complaints from people who live near hills which are not deemed
                steep enough for a grit box to be provided but which, when the
                frost comes in the winter, do present serious problems for

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of salt boxes and grit piles causes
                difficulties, particularly during the periodic visits by Roads
                Service officials to local councils. Invariably, during the
                winter visit, local councils make representations such as the
                one that Mr Hamilton has just made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is difficult to provide a salt box or grit
                pile at every incline, regardless of its steepness or the number
                of dwellings on it. Roads Service officials will deal
                sympathetically with requests from people who live on an
                incline, from their local representatives — MPs, MLAs or
                councillors — or from the corporate body of the council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware, as are others, of instances in

                more closely the provision of salt boxes. I expect Roads Service
                officials to treat the matter in a sympathetic manner. I would
                like details of requests for salt boxes that have not been met,
                and I will ask my Roads Service officials to explain the
                decisions.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister referred to the provision for
                footpaths in town centres and the need for collaboration with
                agencies such as district councils. Will the Roads Service
                liaise with the district councils at an early stage to establish
                ways to clear and grit footpaths in winter? The Department is
                trying to encourage people to use means of transport other than
                cars. Last winter, many pedestrians had to walk on the roads,
                which was very dangerous. I would like footpaths to be cleared
                and gritted.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am at a disadvantage, because I have not
                been present for the entire debate. The Roads Service will write
                to every district council to try to reach a series of agreements
                with them. Mr Poots is correct to state that many footpaths and
                pedestrian zones become dangerous in extreme weather conditions.
                There have been occasions on which council staff could have
                cleared those footpaths and zones, but were not asked to do so
                because the necessary agreements had not been put in place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review will speed up that process and
                ensure that there is urgent communication with councils over the
                next couple of months, well in advance of the winter gritting
                season. I hope that, at that stage, councils will be able to
                enter into an agreement with the Roads Service. Although the
                agreements will be voluntary, the public will benefit from them.</p>

                Development Bill [NIA 18/00] be agreed.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will recall that the Agenda for
                Government identified the focusing of the economic development
                agencies on new economic challenges as a key issue. In taking
                that matter forward by means of the Industrial Development Bill,
                I have considered how the economic development agencies within
                the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment
                can be reorganised to meet those new challenges in the most
                efficient and effective manner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a first step, I commissioned detailed
                research on the current arrangements and on how economic
                development support is administered in other parts of the United
                Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, mainland Europe and further
                afield. I also sought a detailed report on local enterprise
                provision. Last October, I issued a consultative paper entitled
                ‘Towards a new structure for economic development support in
                Northern Ireland’. It was sent to members of the Executive, to
                the Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee, to business
                bodies and to other social partners, among others, through the
                Economic Development Forum and the Northern Ireland Public
                Alliance, the trade union representing staff in the existing
                agencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Responses were received from over 40
                interested parties, representing a wide cross section of
                opinion. The overwhelming weight of opinion supported the view
                that the time was now right for better and more efficient
                delivery of economic development support services and that the
                best and most efficient means of achieving that was through the
                establishment of a new single agency. The predominate opinion
                was that such an agency would have more flexibility, more
                credibility and would be more responsive to the needs of its
                clients if it were at arm’s length from Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Industrial Development Bill will
                establish a single economic development agency as a
                non-departmental public body. Members will recall that I
                recently proposed that the new body be known as Invest Northern
                Ireland (INI). The Bill transfers the powers provided by the
                Industrial Development (Northern Ireland) Order 1982 to Invest
                Northern Ireland. That will allow it to exercise the functions
                currently within the remit of the Industrial Development Board (IDB),
                the Local Enterprise Development Unit (LEDU), the Industrial
                Research and Technology Unit (IRTU), the business support
                division of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment
                — formerly part of the Training and Employment Agency — and
                the business support activities of the Northern Ireland Tourist
                Board. It also transfers the current assets and liabilities of
                those bodies and amends the Industrial Development (Northern
                Ireland) Order 1982 and the related legislation that underpins
                their activities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main purpose of the Bill, therefore, is
                to establish Invest Northern Ireland and transfer powers to it.
                Although the Bill specifies the parameters of matters such as
                membership and remuneration of the board of Invest Northern
                Ireland, as well as staffing and financial arrangements, it
                seeks only minor variations to existing powers in respect of the
                provision of financial assistance to business. Consequently, the
                Bill has no significant impact on the policy and functions of
                existing agencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill consists of eight clauses and four
                schedules. I will briefly outline the key aspects of the
                principal clauses. First, I must point out that the Bill should
                be read in conjunction with the Industrial Development (Northern
                Ireland) Order 1982, as the main functions of Invest Northern
                Ireland will derive from Part III of that Order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 1 establishes Invest Northern Ireland
                as a body corporate, and, in tandem with schedule 1, sets out
                its status, constitution and procedures. Paragraph 1 of schedule
                1 defines Invest Northern Ireland’s status as a
                non-departmental public body; it is not, therefore, an agent of
                or the property of the Crown. Paragraphs 2 to 4 cover the
                setting up of the board of Invest Northern Ireland. They enable
                the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to appoint a
                chairperson and a board consisting of between 10 and 20 members.
                The composition will reflect experience in the various
                activities of Invest Northern Ireland and shall, as far as
                possible, be representative of the community in Northern
                Ireland. The Bill also allows for a member of the board to be
                appointed as deputy chairperson. All appointments will be for up
                to five years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is intended that both the chairperson and
                members of the Invest Northern Ireland board will receive
                remuneration and allowances at a level determined by the
                Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. As Members will
                have noted, advertisements have already appeared in the local
                and national press seeking to recruit persons to a shadow board,
                which should be in place before the end of August 2001. We plan
                to advertise the post of chief executive designate before the
                summer is over. The chief executive designate will assist the
                shadow board in its deliberations on the preparatory work
                essential to the establishment of Invest Northern Ireland. For
                this reason, paragraph 5 of schedule 1 provides that the
                Department will appoint the first chief executive of Invest
                Northern Ireland. I will, of course, consult the members of the
                shadow board and involve them in that most important
                appointment. Invest Northern Ireland will appoint every
                subsequent chief executive.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 5 also provides for Invest Northern
                Ireland to appoint additional staff as it considers appropriate.
                Paragraph 6 allows for staff employed in the Northern Ireland
                Civil Service to be seconded to Invest Northern Ireland. It is
                envisaged that, in the first instance, a significant body of
                civil servants will be seconded to Invest Northern Ireland for a
                transitional period. That will mean that, from day one, Invest
                Northern Ireland will employ staff who are experienced in its
                field of operation. Through time, staff on secondment will have
                to decide whether to return to the Northern Ireland Civil
                Service or become permanent staff of Invest Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 7 empowers Invest Northern Ireland
                to determine employees’ remuneration and allowances, to
                maintain pension arrangements and pay gratuities. Those
                determinations will require the prior approval of my Department
                and the Department of Finance and Personnel. Paragraphs 8 to 12
                empower Invest Northern Ireland to establish committees and the
                proceedings governing their meetings. The accountability of
                Invest Northern Ireland is of paramount importance, and
                paragraphs 16 to 18 allow for the funding of Invest Northern
                Ireland by the Department. Those paragraphs also set out the
                requirement that the agency produce proper accounts for each
                financial year. As a non-departmental public body, Invest
                Northern Ireland will be able to make payments in accordance
                with terms and conditions to be agreed with my Department and
                the Department of Finance and Personnel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Officials in my Department and the Department
                of Finance and Personnel are already working on the practical
                details of the new accountability arrangements. I look forward
                to working in co-operation with my ministerial Colleague, Mark
                Durkan, and the members of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade
                and Investment to ensure that we achieve the essential balance
                between maximum freedom and flexibility for Invest Northern
                Ireland and appropriate control and proper accountability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the financial year ending March 2003,
                Invest Northern Ireland must produce proper accounts and make
                them available to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment and the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG).
                The Department will then lay the subsequent C&amp;AG report and
                the accounts before the House for scrutiny. Similarly, the Bill
                requires Invest Northern Ireland to produce for the Department
                of Enterprise, Trade and Investment an annual report, which will
                be laid before the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 19 brings Invest Northern Ireland
                within the scope of the Commissioner for Complaints (Northern
                Ireland) Order 1996 and thereby brings it within the scope of
                section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 2 and schedule 3 transfer existing
                industrial development powers to Invest Northern Ireland, thus
                creating its powers. In broad terms, that means that from the
                appointed day, Invest Northern Ireland will exercise the
                functions previously carried out under Part III of the
                Industrial Development (Northern Ireland) Order 1982 and article
                3 of the Energy Efficiency (Northern Ireland) Order 1999. Clause
                2(1)(a) will enable Invest Northern Ireland to provide financial
                assistance for industrial undertakings. Clause 2(1)(b) enables
                Invest Northern Ireland to take action for the purpose of
                promoting the efficient use of energy in industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 2(3) obligates Invest Northern Ireland
                to advise the Department generally on the formulation of its
                industrial development policy. Although the Department of
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment will retain responsibility for
                economic development policy, an essential aspect of that will be
                guided by the practical experiences of Invest Northern Ireland
                in its crucial role of programme delivery. Clauses 2(4) and (5)
                empower the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to
                issue directions to Invest Northern Ireland after consulting
                with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Schedule 3 sets out the amendments that the
                Bill makes to the Industrial Development (Northern Ireland)
                Order 1982 and the Energy Efficiency (Northern Ireland) Order
                1999. Paragraph 15 amends schedule 2 of the Industrial
                Development (Northern Ireland) Order with regard to the
                compulsory purchase of land by Invest Northern Ireland. It will
                enable the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to
                make a vesting order at the request of and on behalf of Invest
                Northern Ireland if the latter proposes to acquire land without
                agreement. One of the effects of the amendment will be to lessen
                the likelihood of any criticism that the body seeking the
                vesting order and the actual vesting body are one and the same.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 3 and schedule 2 dissolve the existing
                bodies. Subsections (1) to (3) effect, from the appointed day,
                the dissolution of the Industrial Development Board (IDB), the
                Local Enterprise Development Unit (LEDU) and the Industrial
                Research and Technology Unit (IRTU). Clause 3(4) removes the
                Northern Ireland Tourist Board’s powers to provide assistance
                for the purposes of providing or improving tourist
                accommodation. The power to provide assistance for those
                purposes will be exercised by Invest Northern Ireland under
                article 7 of the Industrial Development (Northern Ireland) Order
                1982, as amended by this Bill. The Northern Ireland Tourist
                Board will no longer have the power to offer grant assistance
                for tourist accommodation. From now on, tourism businesses will
                be treated like any other businesses. That change is made in
                response to points raised by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board
                and the wider tourism sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Schedule 2 makes provision for the transfer
                of the relevant property, rights, liabilities and staff to
                Invest Northern Ireland. That will involve the transfer of
                permanent staff from LEDU and the Tourist Board and the transfer
                of property, rights and liabilities from LEDU, the Tourist
                Board, the Department, IDB and IRTU. It also specifies the
                transitional arrangements for the preparation and laying of the
                necessary final accounts and reports of the bodies being
                dissolved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 5 details amendments and repeals.
                Clause 5(2) removes an existing restriction in article 7(6) of
                the 1982 Order, with regard to the taking of equity as a means
                of offering financial assistance. Current policy thinking no
                longer sees the taking of equity as a last resort, and the
                amendment will enable Invest Northern Ireland to utilise the
                taking of equity more proactively in offers of financial
                assistance. That brings the legislation into line with existing
                practice. Reflecting ‘Strategy 2010’ thinking, it also
                offers the prospect that the Exchequer will benefit from the
                most successful projects, because the Government will have the
                opportunity to share in the success of companies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Subsection (3) is a technical amendment to
                deal with a minor anomaly in the charging of interest on loans
                made under the 1982 Order. There have been instances where the
                principal and interest on a loan are not repaid by means of
                instalments but are repayable in total on or before a specified
                date. In such cases article 7(7) of the 1982 Order does not
                apply, and additional interest cannot therefore be charged.
                Hence, I am seeking to modify the provision to allow for
                additional interest to be charged irrespective of whether the
                principal or interest is repayable by instalments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 6 retains in the Department of
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment the powers under the 1982 Order
                to offer financial assistance to the gas and electricity
                industries, responsibility for which will remain with my
                Department. It is, however, only a temporary saving until the
                issue can be fully addressed in forthcoming energy legislation.
                The saving therefore expires three years from the appointed day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 7 gives the Department the power to
                bring the provisions of the Bill into force by order. As Members
                will be aware, it is intended that Invest Northern Ireland be
                established in early 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Bill will pave the way to the
                creation of what I believe is the desire of all Members and the
                wider business community: a new and vibrant economic development
                agency. The Bill will establish Invest Northern Ireland and will
                enable it to respond quickly, efficiently and effectively in an
                intensely competitive global marketplace in which the emphasis
                must be on getting the job done and not on bureaucracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to express once again our appreciation
                for the professionalism and hard work of those currently
                employed in the existing agencies. They have had exceptional
                years, especially last year. The moves that we are making are
                not a reflection on their abilities but rather an understanding
                that the nature of business and the relationship between
                Government and business must change in modern circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is slowly climbing back to
                normality, and it is essential that we capitalise on the new
                opportunities that are opening up to us. If we are to attract
                the best, we must modernise, innovate and seek new and better
                ways of doing the job. The Industrial Development Bill lays the
                necessary foundations to enable us to realise our vision for a
                new and better Northern Irish economy, and I hereby commend the
                Bill to the Assembly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I pay tribute to the Minister. This change
                has been mooted for a long time, and he has taken the initiative
                and acted. The separation between the two main agencies, IDB and
                LEDU, based on company size, has created confusion. A precedent
                was recently set in the Republic of Ireland, where one agency
                was brought into being with two internal branches, one relating
                to industry of home origin and the other to externally owned
                firms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make three points about the Bill.
                The first is the need to build on past achievements; the second
                is getting the right person for the top of the new agency; and
                the third is the need for the general policy and direction of
                the agency to focus, as the Minister said, on raising the
                productivity of the Northern Ireland economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a need for a balanced view of the
                past. At the end of his speech, the Minister rightly said that
                as we are now marking the end of a series of agencies — or
                their incorporation together into one larger body — it is
                appropriate to pay tribute to all those who have worked in those
                bodies in previous decades. The bookshelves groan under the
                weight of the reports and books that have sought to evaluate
                those agencies over the past 25 years: the Northern Ireland
                Economic Council; the Economic Research Centre; the Economic and
                Social Research Institute; and others. I confess that I was
                involved with one or two of them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As IDB and LEDU pass into history, we should
                note that since 1969 they have had to labour under more
                difficult circumstances than those faced by their counterparts
                in Wales, Scotland or the Republic of Ireland. It is also worth
                saying — the point has been made in this House, and it may be
                made this afternoon — that, contrary to the allegation that
                there was a bias in the way in which those agencies worked in
                different parts of the Province, all the available academic
                studies suggest that the distribution of inward investment into
                Northern Ireland was equitable. I refer to, for example, a study
                conducted in the department of economics at Queen’s
                University, which came to that conclusion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IDB and LEDU have had different cultures for
                dealing with companies. It is important that the good is
                preserved when we bring them together. For example, in the past
                decade, LEDU has built up a system of creating strong
                relationships with companies that were identified as having high
                growth potential.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My second point relates to the importance of
                getting the right person at the top of the new agency. It is not
                possible to go into specifics, but it would be desirable to have
                someone with a high level of business experience and wider
                international experience. They will have to be paid accordingly.
                It may not be populist politics to say so, but the salary should
                reflect internationally competitive standards for executive pay.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, with regard to the broader policy
                environment, the agency should focus on raising the
                productivity, or output per head, of the Northern Ireland
                economy. There is a good argument to be made that that has been
                the crucial problem facing our economy since 1921, because it
                has fed through into so many other characteristics, such as
                relatively high rates of unemployment.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our levels of gross domestic product per head
                have moved up slowly toward those in the rest of the United
                Kingdom and Europe, but it has been a slow, and irregular,
                process of so-called convergence. Indeed, since about 1990, the
                available indications suggest that our standard of living has
                got stuck at roughly four fifths of the United Kingdom and
                European Union average. There are no clear trends of
                improvement. Similarly, there has been a shortfall in relative
                productivity, especially in manufacturing and some other
                sectors. During the early part of the 1990s, our wage levels
                began to decline in relation to those in the rest of the United
                Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a previous occasion, when referring to the
                development of the single agency, the Minister talked about
                innovation and research and development as the golden thread
                that would run through the structure and purpose of the new
                body. I welcome that, not least because there is so much
                evidence to show that increasing the level of research and
                development will, in turn, have an impact on the level of
                relative productivity and general industrial competitiveness.
                With those three points in mind, I commend the Bill.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amalgamation of the IDB, LEDU, the
                Industrial Research and Technology Unit, the business function
                of the Tourist Board and the business support division of the
                Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment was a high
                priority on the wish-list of much of the corporate community —
                indeed, most of the political community — in Northern Ireland
                for many years. I am thankful that that wish is now set to
                become reality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I pay tribute to the work of many. I have no
                doubt that the process would have been significantly slower, and
                perhaps non-existent, had it not been for the work of the
                Executive, the Assembly and the Committee for Enterprise, Trade
                and Investment. Although I do not want to single out any
                individual, I feel that Members will forgive me for recognising
                the unique role played by the Minister. He has shown a
                single-minded determination to make the changes that he feels
                are required to face the commercial challenges of the
                twenty-first century. Many of us agree with him. Perhaps it is
                no accident, for his views were honed in the city hall in
                Belfast where, in the past, he and myself and others experienced
                only frustration and despair in dealing with the predecessor of
                the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That said, the Bill is largely functional. It
                is difficult to disagree with it, because the functional role is
                largely taking over the existing liabilities and
                responsibilities. My serious concerns with the new agency are to
                do with its philosophy and culture, rather than the purely
                functional aspects. The Minister, in the course of his speech,
                suggested that the philosophy and culture would not change too
                much. I worry about that. I believe that the culture has to
                change quite a lot.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we were to use a couple of words to sum up
                the restructuring process, they would be &quot;creating
                synergy&quot;. At the heart of the process is the hope that the
                synergy of combining public sector experience with private
                sector expertise will significantly strengthen the hand of those
                promoting and nurturing new business in Northern Ireland. It has
                long been held that to get the proper calibre of investment, to
                provide the growth strategies required for new business and to
                target new areas for research, we needed to have a much stronger
                private sector influence. I hope that the decision to open up a
                space for private sector influence will make a significant
                contribution to the welfare of the whole community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have been assured that Invest Northern
                Ireland will not simply be IDB with three additional arms
                flailing about wildly. I believe that there is still a risk of
                such an outcome. The work of the new agency could be hampered by
                a heavy overlay of bureaucracy. The Civil Service has a key role
                to play in the process but, for better or worse, it should not
                have the dominant role. Too much bureaucracy strangles the
                culture of enterprise and risk. The safety mentality is at odds
                with the corporate culture of the bodies that we are trying to
                attract. Getting the balance right between, on the one hand,
                accountability and political control and, on the other, opening
                things up to commercial realities is at the nub of the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like other Members who have spoken, I salute
                the IDB and other bodies such as LEDU and the IRTU for the work
                that they have done. Invest Northern Ireland must be market-led
                and outcome-driven. We must speak the language of corporate USA,
                corporate Europe and corporate Britain — the language of
                marketing. The new agency must decide what it wants to achieve
                and what shape Northern Ireland business — Northern Ireland
                plc — should take in the next five, 10, or 15 years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The top priority for the new agency — I
                have mentioned it before — is to create an open, dynamic and
                committed strategy for research and development. If that is not
                built in at the core of everything and at every level, we will
                never be able to do what we want to do. We have had some
                successes recently with call centres, software projects, and so
                on, but research and development is crucially important if we
                are to identify the opportunities offered by rapidly evolving
                technology. It is not a new approach on this island. In the
                1980s, senior figures in the Industrial Development Agency (IDA)
                and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in the
                South made a major effort to identify opportunities and put
                their economy in a position to attract new investment. The
                result was what is referred to as the &quot;Celtic tiger&quot;.
                I would not overrate the &quot;Celtic tiger&quot;, but the
                Southern Irish economy was given a major boost.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot offer a 10% corporation tax rate
                here, but we can offer many advantages. Our greatest strength is
                our people. There is a large pool of well-trained, highly
                educated people, ready and able to work, if the work is
                available for them. We also have a range of incentives that we
                can offer to those who might wish to invest here. We cannot
                simply react to events; we must think and act strategically, and
                research and development is a key component of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we want to be market leaders in new and
                emerging fields, it is imperative that research and development
                be at the top of our list of priorities. We have had many
                success stories in the past few years in areas as diverse as
                global e-mail, wireless application protocol (WAP) technology
                and electronic components. Many indigenous companies triumphed.
                We must encourage others, and to do that we need an environment
                that is conducive to doing business.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Above all, we need to remove the fear and
                stigma of failure in business. Last August some Committee
                members accompanied the Minister on a visit to the United
                States, where failure is almost a qualification for future
                success. Those who have failed and have used that experience to
                come back and succeed are among the top business people in the
                United States. However, those who do not try at all will never
                succeed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Silicon Valley, California, which we hear
                a great deal about, the most respected leaders are those who
                have failed. Some of them have failed more than once and yet
                rise and fight again. In Northern Ireland, we tend to write off
                people who fail. In doing so, we are probably choking our
                potential future resource. Someone who has almost made it to the
                summit of Mount Everest has a hell of a lot of experience that
                can be brought to bear in climbing a slightly less elevated
                mountain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Invest Northern Ireland should be a guiding
                light in creating a more business-friendly environment and in
                doing so should be the engine that makes things happen. If that
                can be attained, the restructuring will have achieved many of
                the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment’s
                objectives.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Bill and the close co-operation
                that there has been between the Minister and the Committee for
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment. The Industrial Development
                Bill is an important step in the modernisation of Northern
                Ireland’s approach to economic and industrial development. It
                is important that we get it right. The new agency is a vast
                undertaking, and it will become a super-agency with a combined
                budget for this year of at least £200 million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The important message at the end of the
                Minister’s statement was that the emphasis must be on getting
                the job done and not on bureaucracy. There is an absolute
                commitment that Invest Northern Ireland will not become tied up
                in its own bureaucracy as a result of being a super-agency. It
                must always keep its feet on the ground and get its priorities
                right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister mentioned the composition of the
                board; he suggested that, as far as possible, it should be
                representative of the community. That representation of the
                community should take gender balance into account. Sadly, there
                has been a lack of women at the top of the economic development
                tree in Northern Ireland. That is reflected in the world of
                economic development. It is one area in which women do not
                appear at the top of the management structure. It would be
                appropriate if as much as possible could be done to make the
                board representative of the gender balance in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Certain staffing representations were made,
                and the Equality Commission proofed the Bill on those grounds.
                The facts speak for themselves. A breakdown of staff according
                to gender is available for the new agency. Fifty-one per cent of
                the staff are female and 49% are male — exactly representative
                of society. However, at senior management level — principal
                and above — 16% of the staff are female and 84% are male. That
                is not acceptable today. Proactive measures are needed to
                encourage the promotion of women. Thirty-nine per cent of staff
                in middle management are female, but something must be done to
                break that glass ceiling and allow women to rise to their
                rightful positions in top management in economic development. It
                is right that people are nominated to the economic development
                forum, but it would be nice if something could be done to get
                more women involved in the forum. Their voices are important at
                that level also.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to talk about the geographical balance
                of the aid provided by the agencies in Northern Ireland. It may
                be a policy matter, but perhaps it could be reflected in the
                functions of the new agency. I have read the figures of the
                Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and its agencies
                on the geographical spread of funding and support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will begin with the Industrial Research
                Technology Unit (IRTU) and the thousands of pounds committed. I
                note that north Down and south Down are at the bottom of the
                heap as regards research and development. It comes as quite a
                surprise to me that that is the case, when other areas can rise
                to £2 million or £3 million. My calculation is that south Down
                is getting £0·2 million. The geographical balance of aid is
                important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to talk about the geographical
                balance of IDB assistance by district council area. Although I
                represent North Down, I am astounded that Moyle does not
                feature. Perhaps there is a statistical explanation for that.
                There has been virtually nothing for Moyle in investments and
                IDB assistance by district council area in the last five years
                — and nothing for Armagh.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been nothing for Armagh, and that
                is an important point. I would be interested to hear the
                explanation for it. It could not be because those areas have no
                investment potential.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that the Bill will promote
                the efficient use of energy in industry. It is part and parcel
                of the amalgamation that is part of the legislation. I would
                like to see much greater advances in that area, and I would like
                more notice to be taken of energy efficiency, renewable energy
                and aid for renewable energy. That is an important priority. Dr
                McDonnell referred to research and development. That is
                important, but I believe that green energy, whether it be energy
                efficiency or renewable energy, is very important.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is vitally important, and we will watch
                it with a great deal of interest. Dr McDonnell commented on the
                philosophy and culture. We believe that as far as possible there
                should be a grass-roots culture, which should protect and invest
                in local indigenous industry, while being farsighted in getting
                new industries on board.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Minister for getting the Bill
                to this stage. He has has gone into great detail about the new
                agency, Invest Northern Ireland, and the transfer of staff.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to make a special plea to the
                Minister, and he will not be surprised to hear that it is for
                the north-west. Derry has been recognised in report after report
                as a regional hub. Would it not be eminently sensible for Invest
                Northern Ireland to have a substantial presence in the Maiden
                City? The closure of the IDB office some years ago left a
                particularly bitter taste in the mouth of the people of Derry,
                especially of those people who were actively involved in the
                economic and industrial regeneration of the city. The Minister
                has a unique opportunity to correct a wrong and at the same time
                to build upon Derry’s spirit of enterprise and innovation. I
                ask the Minister to facilitate Invest Northern Ireland in
                locating a substantial presence in the north- west, particularly
                in our own Maiden City — not just a few additional jobs in the
                Derry office, but a real presence. It is important that the
                Minister act now. After Invest Northern Ireland is set up, the
                arms-length relationship will reduce the Minister’s influence
                in decisions on job locations. For too long, the people of Derry
                have had to make do, without a substantial presence. I ask the
                Minister to address the matter.</p>

                This is an important Bill, and it has the impact that the
                Committee wanted. However, for the rest of us, its importance
                lies in what the new body might do in comparison with what has
                been done in the past in our own areas. I welcome the change to
                what is perhaps a superagency, but an important factor is that
                people will be watching what will happen. This body is not LEDU
                and IDB repackaged; it must make an impact on its own. However,
                I am concerned that there has been some jockeying of the
                previous bodies to make way for the future body. I hope that
                this is a change for the better.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since 1982, massive changes have taken place
                in the global economy. The new body will have a completely
                different agenda to work to. It must deliver locally for small
                and medium-sized businesses in rural areas, and it must help the
                individual. An agency with glossy annuals is of no use if it
                neglects the representatives of small business who read of what
                can be achieved in the media but can achieve nothing for
                themselves. That perception must be surmounted by the new body;
                it must make a different image for itself by helping small
                businesses to achieve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was said that IDB and LEDU have delivered
                equitably. Fermanagh people would not necessarily go along with
                that. The difficulty with the way that those bodies were set up
                was that they were not able to deliver to small businesses. We
                hope that that will change. The economy in Fermanagh and Tyrone
                is like that of many other rural areas. It depends on small
                rather than large businesses. Businesses that create jobs for 50
                plus employees often fall between two stools, while businesses
                started by single entrepreneurs that create between five and 10
                jobs fail for lack of capital. The local challenge must be dealt
                with. Competitiveness and benchmarking against the achievements
                of the South and other countries such as the USA are critical.
                The South is the world’s second largest exporter of IT
                software, the first being the USA. That is a considerable
                achievement, but such an approach also runs the risk of putting
                all the eggs in one basket.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I look forward to seeing the outcomes and
                achievements of this body. There is a mindset among people in
                many institutions — including, in some instances, the Civil
                Service — that everything stops at the end of the M1. Such
                people do not consider sending investors to places west of the
                Bann. That mindset must change. At the very least, investors
                must be encouraged to move to other areas. In the South,
                investment in the outer reaches is actively promoted. Perhaps
                that can be done here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that we are limited to
                areas that people want to invest in. Some people may want to
                build their factory in Belfast or Craigavon, and we cannot do
                much about that. However, local Governments such as ours can
                actively promote areas, encourage investors to visit those areas
                and to see them as places where corporate people can enjoy a
                good quality of life. Quality of life is almost as important as
                the distance one has to travel for business.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IT industry does not require transport
                over long distances. It can also work to enhance the environment
                in areas such as Fermanagh, where the environment is an
                important factor. On the other hand, people such as Sean Quinn
                would not be allowed to build anything today if it were up to
                the planners.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Designated tourism areas are important. We
                will gain much from tourism, but there are other industries that
                we would like to see moving to Fermanagh and Tyrone. The changes
                that will come as a result of the erection of the new body will
                be for the betterment of the people in those areas, improving
                their quality of life and creating jobs.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened carefully to what was said,
                and I will try to reply to as many points as possible. We will
                look at Hansard later and, if necessary, I will pick up on any
                concerns that Members have expressed if I miss them now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie referred to the importance of
                having the right person at the top of the organisation. I assure
                him that the Department has been thinking about that. We have
                appointed special consultants, with whom I spent some time in
                London, and we went through the profile of the type of person
                that we would wish to see occupying that position. We also
                recognise Dr McDonnell’s point that the appointee would have
                to be given a package appropriate to the post. We have taken
                advice on that. We have compared the situation with that in
                other jurisdictions, and we believe that we have arrived at a
                competitive package. I made it clear to the consultants that the
                person must know what a customer is. That type of experience is
                crucial to performing what will be a very important function.
                The person involved will preside over an organisation of 700 or
                800 people with a budget of approximately £200 million per
                annum. It is an important and responsible job. It will involve
                interfacing with the public sector, and there are accountability
                issues. Therefore it is a high profile position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie also mentioned the issue of
                productivity per head. There are a number of ways in which the
                Minister and my Department will continue to influence that.
                Three-year corporate plans will have to be produced, and there
                will be an annual operating plan. We will have to agree those
                plans, and it will be clear that we have to set out targets and
                objectives for the agency. That is the mechanism through which
                we intend to have influence over those issues. Targets based on
                benchmarking and scoping studies will have to be set, and the
                Assembly will have to be able to evaluate whether those targets
                are being achieved. Indeed, that will be one of the ways of
                measuring the success, or otherwise, of the agency.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Raising performance levels and having a
                balanced view of the past are important, but it is felt that we
                have moved on, that businesses have changed and that the
                previous agencies were set up at different points over a 30-year
                period. Dr Birnie referred to the unique way that Northern
                Ireland previously divided businesses by size, when the
                principles very often remained the same. Also, large employers
                are no longer around as they were 30 years ago. It is time for a
                change. I want to make it clear to Members that it is not simply
                a matter of bolting together the existing agencies — we are
                creating a new one. I want to come back to that point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie and Dr McDonnell referred to
                research and development, which I said was the golden thread
                that will run right through the agency. There is absolutely no
                doubt — Dr Birnie and Dr McDonnell have raised this point on
                many occasions — that if the innovation strategy is not
                brought right to the core of the agency, we will have failed. I
                readily accept that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Things have moved on, and there must be a
                different approach. Many ideas have been generated through
                research in universities, by private companies and even in the
                public sector. Industry can convert those ideas into productive
                processes or tradable services that will enable us to bring
                products to the market and differentiate us from the low-wage
                economies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell also mentioned the philosophy of
                the agency. I hope that he did not pick me up wrongly. I do not
                anticipate that we will simply carry forward what was there
                before. There must be a new approach. I accept entirely that it
                must be based on innovation. Private sector involvement and
                influence will, of course, be crucial. However, we readily
                accept — and the Minister of Finance and Personnel is watching
                this closely — that although that there has been a reduction
                in the assistance offered by the state over recent years, it is
                not only money that matters to businesses. They require a whole
                range of other services and assistance that can be critical to
                their ability to survive and grow. The growth of small
                businesses and an increase in the start rate will be two of the
                benchmarks and targets that we must set. Although the
                sustainability of our new businesses is quite high, our start
                rate is low. That is another challenge that has been set up for
                us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concept of IDB with three additional arms
                flailing around is certainly not my vision, nor that of the
                Committee or of Members. We see a totally different
                organisation, but the new agency must start somewhere, and it
                will start with persons who currently work for the other bodies.
                It will take time to get going, but it will ultimately have
                control of its own destiny. Our task will be to ensure that the
                new agency is set targets and asked to do things that are
                realistic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have referred to the stigma of failure. Dr
                McDonnell is of a similar view to myself. It is a problem in
                Northern Ireland and in these islands. In the United States, the
                attitude varies from place to place, but people there do not
                wear bags over their heads if a business does not work out. As
                Dr McDonnell said, those people are often at a premium because
                they have had an important experience.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of accountability has been
                mentioned. The new agency has been referred to as a very large
                organisation with a substantial budget. However, while wanting
                to have the maximum flexibility, we also want to ensure that the
                accountability arrangements are appropriate and that this House
                continues to have sight of and control of the resource. As I
                said in my opening statement, my officials are working with
                officials from the Department of Finance and Personnel to ensure
                that the issues of accountability are properly dealt with. The
                Department of Finance and Personnel has specific responsibility
                for those issues, and we will work closely with it as we move
                forward to ensure that there is access for the Comptroller and
                Auditor General and that Members of this House have full and
                free access to all financial and other information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice referred to a number of issues,
                and I want to draw one or two points to her attention. She
                raised the question of gender issues, not only at board level
                but also at staff and other levels. She will be aware that some
                weeks ago we advertised very widely in local papers and further
                afield for membership of the board. We received in excess of 150
                responses, but I have to say that the number of applications
                from women was in single figures. I want to put on record that,
                from a gender point of view, that response was exceedingly low
                and disappointing. That does not go into the nature and quality
                of the applications received, which are now being dealt with;
                rather, it refers to the volume of applications from women. That
                is a matter of very grave concern to our officials, who are
                currently interviewing for the board. We have of course brought
                in an independent figure to sit in on those interviews, and I am
                satisfied that the structure of those will meet with Members’
                approval.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly, the concern about gender relates not
                only to the board. I take Ms Morrice’s point. When this agency
                is up and running it will have its own equality schemes, and
                those will have to be approved in the normal way. Currently,
                schemes such as IDB’s are covered by the departmental scheme.
                IDB is at present an integral part of the Department of
                Enterprise, Trade and Industry. There is no doubt that there is
                an awareness of the issue, not only in the economic development
                agencies but throughout the service. I know that the Minister of
                Finance and Personnel is watching these matters carefully, as we
                have made commitments in the Programme for Government to achieve
                progress in these matters right across the board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must make a number of points on the
                geographical balance of aid. IDB and the economic development
                agencies have client companies in different locations. Moyle was
                mentioned, and regrettably we have only two client companies in
                that district council area. It is not necessarily the case that
                those particular businesses either come forward with, or can be
                encouraged to — or wish to — put themselves forward for, any
                of the schemes operated by the Department. It also depends on
                the nature of the businesses. Ms Morrice also mentioned north
                Down and south Down. Again, with regard to research and
                development, it depends on the concentration of businesses and
                where the most appropriate businesses for that type of activity
                are located. There are historical issues that are outside our
                control. I can assure the Member that the question of
                distribution is one that is continuously and consistently
                brought to our attention. However, Members have to be aware that
                business is where business is.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh — and this also relates to Ms
                Morrice’s question — raised the issue of distribution west
                of the Bann. As the Member knows, the Department has a number of
                targets. One of those is that 75% of first-time visits should be
                to New TSN areas. We slightly exceeded that target last year,
                with about 76% of first-time visits going to New TSN areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where possible, we encourage companies to
                visit and to invest, and, as I have said many times before in
                the House, we do bring forward enhanced offers of assistance to
                companies that are prepared to invest in New TSN areas. On some
                occasions, companies will avail of those opportunities, but on
                other occasions they will refuse them point-blank. We cannot
                force companies — and the Member acknowledged this — to
                establish themselves in areas where they do not consider it to
                be in their interests to do so. We can encourage and persuade,
                but we cannot force.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commitment to try to achieve distribution
                along these lines is undoubtedly there. The Member for Fermanagh
                and South Tyrone (Mr McHugh) will be aware that I have been in
                that constituency on a number of occasions recently. I am aware
                of the difficulties, and I am aware of the feeling of isolation
                and the feeling that perhaps Belfast-based agencies do not care.
                However, I assure Mr McHugh that that is not the case: we do
                care; I care. There are commitments in the departmental plans,
                and I believe that it is for us to ensure that the agency is
                charged, when established, with achieving targets that are
                consistent with the Programme for Government objectives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney, uncharacteristically,
                encouraged me to ensure that additional investment went to
                Londonderry. I cannot imagine why that was so. It seems to come
                up frequently. On a serious note, there is a commitment that the
                new agency will have a regional dimension. That commitment has
                been made frequently in the House, and I reiterate it today. I
                cannot yet say precisely where the offices will be located, but
                there is a commitment to having a significant regional
                dimension.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For practical reasons, the Department must
                take some action to establish the shadow board and to appoint
                the chief executive. If we do not, it will be next year before
                the board has any statutory powers, and we cannot wait that
                long. Therefore the Department must take the lead and get a few
                things started. However, I want to consult with the shadow
                board, which I hope to appoint before long, so that it can have
                ownership of some of these policy issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I repeat that we are initially appointing a
                small shadow board because I did not wish to anticipate the
                decisions of the House or the Committees on the actual size of
                the board, which will be dealt with in the legislation. The
                intention is that when the legislation is passed, there will be
                a second tranche of appointments to the board to bring it up to
                its agreed final strength. People who applied for positions on
                the shadow board and who were not appointed will, if they so
                wish, be automatically re-entered for the second stage of the
                competition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I place on record my thanks to my
                departmental staff, and in particular those in the restructuring
                branch, for the long hours and months — indeed, over a year’s
                work — that have gone into this; it has been painstaking.
                There have been many hills and hollows to get over, but the
                realisation of our objectives is closer than ever before.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that I have covered most of the points
                that were made. If I have failed to do so, we will pick them up
                later and contact Members with any points that were missed. The
                aim and objective of the Bill is not simply to shuffle the pack:
                it is not simply doing it for the sake of doing it.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reason for the Bill is to ensure that a
                fresh look is brought to the economy. The current economy is
                different from the one that existed 30 years ago when some of
                those organisations were founded. The nature of business then
                was totally different from today. If we go back only five years,
                the extent to which the economy has changed is dramatic. The
                pace of events, globalisation, the move away from traditional
                industries, and the rise of Third-World countries with their
                low-labour-cost economies were not threats 20 or 30 years ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are a very small region, and nobody owes
                Northern Ireland a living. Therefore we have to make sure that
                everything we do maximises the results and the cost-
                effectiveness of business. That will ensure that our economy can
                grow and strengthen itself. Several Members have identified
                structural weaknesses, but we have achieved great things in a
                short time. All of the agencies are entitled to receive their
                share of criticism. However, I would like to remind people that
                20 or 30 years ago, when people were marketing Northern Ireland,
                the CNN image of this place was a war zone. People were knocking
                on doors and trying to sell Northern Ireland as a place for
                investment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since I started this job, it has never ceased
                to amaze me that we have such a resilient economy, although it
                has weaknesses. Scotland, Wales, the Republic and mainland
                Europe did not have to deal with the problem that we faced,
                which was a huge marketing disadvantage. We must understand the
                backdrop against which those who were charged with the job of
                trying to market this Province had to work. There are
                significant pockets of unemployment, but here we are today,
                enjoying the lowest rates of unemployment for generations. That
                is a tribute not only to the workforce and the businesspeople
                who have shown such resilience, but also to the agency and
                Department staff who attempted to maintain a degree of economic
                stability against a background that was anything but stable.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 23 April the Assembly agreed to suspend,
                until the summer recess, Standing Order 10(2), which sets the
                times of the Monday sittings as from 10.30 am to 6.00 pm. The
                purpose of the suspension was to give the Business Committee the
                freedom to set a later starting time for Monday sittings. This
                would allow parties time to consider the forthcoming week’s
                business. When I introduced the motion I made the point that the
                10.30 am start time did not allow parties sufficient time to
                hold meetings; neither did it provide them with the opportunity
                to discuss amendments to motions that had been tabled that
                morning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In moving that motion, I explained that the
                Committee’s research on Monday plenary timings showed that
                less than six hours were spent in plenary on Mondays. Those six
                hours were almost always interrupted by a lunch break that,
                until the 23 April, lasted on average 1 hour and 45 minutes. The
                research also showed that business often stopped before 6.00 pm.
                These conclusions led the Committee to believe that a start time
                of 12.00 pm would provide sufficient time on a Monday for the
                Assembly to conduct its business.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, rather than make a permanent change,
                the Committee agreed that the new timings should be experimental
                until the summer recess, whereupon decisions on a permanent
                change could be taken. During the debate on the motion, several
                Members expressed concerns about the proposed new timings. They
                were concerned that the Business Committee would have less time
                for Monday’s business, that the time for debate would be
                reduced and that Wednesday sittings might be needed in order to
                complete business. My response was to emphasise that a change
                would only become permanent if it proved beneficial to the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A LeasCheann Comhairle, the Committee on
                Procedures has reviewed this experiment and is content that the
                change has been beneficial and that Members’ concerns have
                proved unfounded. Members may be interested to note that of the
                six Monday sittings since the new start time of noon was
                introduced, only two have lasted until 6.00 pm; three have
                finished before 5.00 pm; there has been a lunch break during
                four of the sittings; and on two occasions the lunch break has
                lasted more than an hour. To date, it has not been necessary to
                sit on a Wednesday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly is sitting this Wednesday, but
                not because of a lack of time on Monday. Rather, it is due to
                the requirements of the five-day rule for stages of legislation
                as set out in Standing Orders, and this Wednesday is the
                earliest date that three Bills on the Order Paper can have their
                Final Stage considered. In the light of the above facts, it is
                clear that Members’ initial concerns on this proposal have not
                been realised. There has been sufficient time to consider
                Assembly business, and there have been no complaints to the
                Procedures Committee from the Business Committee about time
                pressures or about its being forced to curtail the time
                allocated to items of business. Similarly, there has been no
                adverse impact on the Assembly commitment to family-friendly
                policies as there has been no extension to plenary times on a
                Tuesday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, the Committee on Procedures
                believes this proposal is of benefit to the Assembly and
                supports the change to Standard Orders.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, the current Standing Order 64 does not
                conform fully to what is set out in the Northern Ireland Act

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Registrable interests are to be as defined in
                Standing Orders, and currently there is no such definition. The
                current Standing Order also mentions pecuniary interests. This
                is not defined, nor is it in the wording of the 1998 Act, which
                refers to financial interest. The Act says &quot;as defined in

                on 14 December 1999, are sufficient. The proposed amendment to
                this Standing Order includes replacing the term &quot;pecuniary
                interest&quot; with &quot;financial interest&quot;, defines the
                categories of registrable interests and financial interests and
                makes clear the responsibility of the Assembly Clerk of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In moving the motion, the Committee on
                Procedures is putting into effect the recommendations of a
                report, which was unanimously agreed by the Assembly on 2 April
                2001, making provision for it to be the duty of the Committee on
                Standards and Privileges to oversee the work of the Assembly
                Clerk of Standards, examine the arrangements for the
                compilation, maintenance, accessibility and review of a Register
                of Members’ Interests and any other registers of interest,
                consider specific matters relating to privilege referred to the
                Committee and any matters relating to the conduct of Members
                which are brought to the Committee’s attention, make a report
                to the Assembly on any matter falling within this Standing Order
                and recommend to the Assembly that sanctions be applied to any
                Member who has failed to comply with or who has contravened any
                provision of this Standing Order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to implementing the
                recommendations of the Committee’s report, the proposed
                Standing Order will also provide for the appointment of an
                Assembly Commissioner for Standards to investigate and report on
                matters relating to Assembly Members and Assembly privilege. It
                sets out the matters which the commissioner may investigate,
                including alleged breach of privilege, complaints in relation to
                the declaration or registration of interests, alleged
                contravention of the Code of Conduct and the ‘Guide to the
                Rules relating to the Conduct of Members’. It enables the
                commissioner to carry out his or her functions without being
                under the direction or control of the Assembly. A recommendation
                to the Assembly on sanctions against any Member will remain
                within the remit of the Committee on Standards and Privileges.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Standing Order sets out the
                procedure for the dismissal of the commissioner. The requirement
                for any such resolution would require the support of a number of
                Members equal to at least two thirds of the total number of
                Assembly seats, that is, of 72 Members. That is the same as for
                the removal from office of the Comptroller and Auditor General
                as laid down in section 65(2)(b) of the Northern Ireland Act
                1998. I understand that further legal advice has led to an
                amendment to this motion being brought forward by the
                Chairperson of the Committee on Standards and Privileges. This
                Standing Order and Standing Order 64 are intended to ensure that
                we as Members are seen to behave with propriety. This is an
                important issue, and one which we, as Members, will be well
                aware is currently the cause of considerable public interest and
                concern.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In proposed Standing Order 57(7) line 1
                delete &quot;the Assembly may not dismiss&quot; and insert after
                &quot;Standards&quot; &quot;shall not be dismissed&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Chairperson of the Committee on
                Procedures said, the amendments to Standing Order 57 would
                provide the means to ensure implementation in principle of the
                recommendations of the first report by the Committee on
                Standards and Privileges, inquiring into the possible
                appointment of an Assembly Commissioner for Standards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support this motion, which will give effect
                to the Committee’s recommendations on sanctions and privileges
                and will provide the enabling power for the Commissioner for
                Standards to investigate complaints made against Members of the
                Assembly. In supporting the motion, it has also become necessary
                for me to move an amendment to section 7 of the Standing Order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following last-minute legal advice, it has
                become apparent that a minor adjustment to section 7 is required
                in order to ensure that the terms of the Standing Order
                accurately reflect the role and responsibility of the Assembly
                if consideration is being given to the dismissal of an Assembly
                Commissioner for Standards. The intention of section 7 is to put
                in place a framework in which the Assembly shall determine that
                an Assembly Commissioner for Standards is to be dismissed. As
                currently drafted, however, there is an ambiguous reference to
                the dismissal process. My proposed amendment makes an adjustment
                to this wording and removes any ambiguity relating to the powers
                of the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In moving this amendment, I want to
                emphasise, as Chairperson of the Committee on Standards and
                Privileges, my broad support for the motion put down by Conor
                Murphy. I ask all Members to support the motion as amended
                because it will provide reassurance to the general public that
                Assembly Members perform their responsibility to the highest
                standard that they rightly expect.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for the opportunity to query
                the reason for the amendment. One concern that I have is that it
                would remove any procedure that the Assembly would have to
                police the work of the commissioner. While the commissioner
                would carry out — and be expected to carry out — an
                important role, it would also be vital that he or she would be
                subject to some degree of control by the Assembly. I am at a
                loss to know why, as I understand the amendment, the Assembly
                may not dismiss a commissioner under any circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems I have the wrong end of the stick.</p>

                is to remove any ambiguity in the wording; that is the primary
                concern. The Assembly would make the decision about the removal
                of a commissioner, but it is the Assembly Commission that would
                carry out the work. Its aim is to remove the ambiguity of the
                process, rather than to create a further problem.</p>

              prepared by the Committee for Finance and Personnel following its
              inquiry in to the use of public-private partnerships (7/00/R).</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will have received copies of the
              Committee for Finance and Personnel’s report on the use of
              public- private partnerships (PPP) yesterday. The Committee’s
              inquiry into PPP addresses an issue of critical importance. It is
              a key time in the debate on the role of the private sector in
              public services. The issues are vital and relevant to the
              Assembly, to the Executive and, most importantly, to the public at
              large.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We face a very serious problem in how we
              finance and procure major improvements to the public
              infrastructure. Finance will be needed over the coming years to
              fulfil the deficit. The shortfall runs into billions of pounds. It
              is estimated that health, education and housing need at least
              £850&nbsp;million now. Water, roads and public transport will
              need about £4&nbsp;billion over the next 10 to 20 years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel confirmed
              the size of the problem we face. In his evidence to the Committee
              he said:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;If we use all the resources in the
              Northern Ireland block for investment in the conventional
              procurement manner, we will fail to achieve our goals.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee agreed that in pursuing its
              scrutiny and policy advice role, it needs to examine the extent of
              the deficit of investment in public services and infrastructure
              and the part that public-private partnerships might play in
              financing the deficit and improving services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee began its inquiry in March. It
              has generated a great deal of interest from a wide range of people
              and organisations involved in the debate on PPP. We heard from
              people working locally, in Dublin, London and further afield. They
              came from hospitals, schools, trade unions, the academic world,
              international private sector companies and financial institutions,
              and local and central Government. Nearly 60 substantial papers
              were submitted, and the key people from those areas were
              questioned. We examined a range of PPP projects and their effect
              on users, their value for money, the effects of committing money
              over a long term, and the patterns and trends that are starting to
              emerge.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee members spent many hours reading,
              hearing and analysing evidence. No one to whom we spoke was
              neutral. People were either enthusiastic or critical of PPP.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to thank publicly all those who
              contributed to the report. In particular, the Committee wants to
              express its appreciation of the work of the Assembly staff — the
              Clerks and various people who served the Committee, and the
              Hansard staff — and also to thank those who provided hospitality
              and helped during its visits to various locations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee agreed that, ideally, public
              finance is preferred for investment. It can be provided at lower
              interest rates than are generally available in private finance.
              Using public money ensures that responsibility for provision of
              public services remains firmly in the public sector.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel, and the
              Executive, must address the problems of the Barnett formula. That
              has contributed to underinvestment here. They must seek an
              increase in grants if public money is to be used to tacke the
              infrastructure deficit. We recognise that the Treasury is unlikely
              to meet all of the outstanding financial needs from increased
              public expenditure in the short term. If that turns out to be
              true, we must look at other sources of finance to help address the
              deficit. However, we must continue to lobby and ensure that we get
              a fair proportion.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee heard evidence on the benefits of
              revenue and capital bonds, which were deemed a cheaper means of
              financing public sector projects than PPP. Representatives from
              the Department for Regional Development also discussed the
              possibility of a not-for- profit regional investment trust,
              financed by bonds. The Executive need to rigorously investigate
              these methods, and the Department of Finance and Personnel, in its
              own review, needs to clarify their suitability.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee acknowledged that PPPs could be a
              valuable tool or means of investment if used in the right
              circumstances. Many of the witnesses, including users of PPPs,
              were enthusiastic about their benefits. However, other witnesses
              warned us of the dangers and disadvantages of PPPs, especially if
              they are used incorrectly. Members will be aware of the ongoing
              debate on the role of the private sector in public service
              provision. The Committee calls for caution to be taken in regard
              to PPP. Care needs to be taken in deciding how, where, and when
              this method is adopted. We should not blindly follow others down
              the PPP route.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A recent report by the Institute of Public
              Policy Research — ‘Building Better Partnerships’ — argues
              in favour of a pragmatic rather than dogmatic approach to the use
              of the private sector in public service provision. It also calls
              for the reform of PPPs if the Government are to succeed in
              improving the quality of publicly funded services. Their views
              echo the Committee’s own, and the report gives added weight to
              our conclusions and recommendations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee believes that the findings and
              recommendations of the inquiry will help to ensure that any
              decisions on PPP are properly taken and that due regard will be
              given to the overall investment needs of the public sector. More
              effective use of PPPs and other methods will accelerate investment
              in public sector infrastructure. This will improve the quality of
              our public services and economic development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We discovered that a well-planned programme of
              PPP projects is being established in the education sector. I
              congratulate the Minister of Education, the Minister of Higher and
              Further Education, Training and Employment and their staff on
              their work in this field.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, we lag behind in other key areas.
              We need to quickly develop a co-ordinated investment strategy that
              establishes a sustained programme and flow of projects across
              administrative boundaries. There will be a need for effective
              leadership from the Assembly and the Executive, and for a
              commitment from everyone involved.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A key factor in developing the programme will
              be the demonstration of value for money throughout the life of
              each project. I emphasise that this must continue throughout the
              life of projects. The establishment of value for money will
              highlight the impact of long-term spending commitments on the
              Programme for Government and on the quality of public services.
              The establishment of value for money must involve much greater
              openness and public accountability in the decision-making process.
              This point was stressed by many witnesses, particularly trade
              union representatives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among our recommendations is the need to instil
              in the public a confidence that effective action is being taken to
              address the deficit. My Committee has made some important
              recommendations in its report. It is important that the Assembly
              and the Executive be seen to act quickly and decisively on these
              recommendations. The recommendations focus on the strategy and
              structures needed if the Assembly is to be assured that investment
              in the public sector infrastructure is being tackled effectively
              and that it will give the best possible value for money. We have
              learned several important lessons about PPP. The report gives
              examples of good practice that should be adopted by Departments
              when they are considering investment. I commend them to the
              Executive working group, which is reviewing PPP from a
              departmental perspective.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will find the full details of the
              recommendations in the report. I will concentrate briefly on two
              key areas. I will start with recommendation 1. First, and of
              crucial importance, is the need to establish an effective
              investment strategy. The Programme for Government begins to
              address this issue, but we need to go much further. The Programme
              for Government should, of course, underpin the strategy. This
              should be a unified, cross-departmental investment strategy to
              address how the deficit in the public infrastructure should be
              financed and managed in the future. We need to take the idea of
              joined-up government seriously when we consider investment,
              especially in areas where investment cuts across public sector
              boundaries.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A co-ordinated programme of strategic projects
              should support the strategy. That will enable, for example, early
              investment to be channelled into pathfinder projects that can best
              meet the strategy’s objectives — clearly demonstrating value
              for money and the early development of a broader skill base in the
              public and private sectors. It is vital that the strategy have the
              support of all concerned. That includes the private and voluntary
              sectors and local communities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PPP is supposed to be all about partnerships,
              and a social partnership approach should be adopted to achieve
              this consensus. Departments and their public and private partners
              need to reassess how they share information. Achieving that
              support may be difficult. We only have to look at the problems
              encountered in agreeing health priorities to understand the
              difficulties of achieving consensus. However, it is important that
              this happens, if we are to get value for money and provide
              long-term benefits to the public.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now move to recommendation 2. The second key
              recommendation is that the Executive need to establish ministerial
              responsibility for driving the investment strategy forward. The
              Minister should be responsible for achieving a partnership across
              Departments and public bodies. There should be a common approach
              wherever possible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee considered that the Minister
              should set up a temporary working group of representatives from
              each Department. The group would then develop and drive the
              strategy forward in the coming months. It would also initiate work
              on the most appropriate investment methods to be used. Other tasks
              would be to promote a sustainable flow of projects and to look at
              the methodologies, skills and guidance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee also felt that it was important
              that the group begin the development of a social partnership
              approach. We found that this was of benefit when we looked at the
              Dublin situation, where social partnership, and the role of the
              partners, was crucial in taking forward an investment strategy.
              Although this work will get the process going, the Committee
              agreed that the strategy needs to be driven forward over the
              coming years. Therefore the Committee has recommended that a
              central investment board or procurement body be established under
              the control of a designated Minister. That would take on the
              activities of the working group, and it would become a centre of
              excellence on investment, procurement and advice for all
              Departments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issues addressed in this report are matters
              of crucial importance to our future social and economic
              well-being. My Committee took its duty very seriously and worked
              hard to achieve consensus and to agree a report that reflects its
              concerns and proposals for tackling the investment deficit. I
              commend this report to the Assembly, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
              Finance and Personnel (Mr Leslie):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Chairman for his very thorough
              review of this report that the Committee has just published. This
              was a major undertaking into an area of potential public
              procurement that is a hot potato of conflicting opinions. We, I
              hope, encountered, and gave proper consideration to, all of them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My first point is that it would be far easier
              to do this review in 10 years’ time, when you would be able to
              draw on, perhaps, a maximum of 15 years’ experience of private
              finance initiatives and public-private partnerships. The
              initiative started in 1994. The first projects appeared a few
              years later, and most of the projects that the Committee looked at
              were very much in their infancy. While it is easy to identify
              problems that occurred when putting together the contracts,
              conducting the negotiations and dealing with the bids, it is
              impossible at this stage to accurately judge how well a 30-year
              contract has been costed when it has only run for three years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is therefore a considerable act of faith
              involved, particularly by those who are strong advocates of the
              private finance initiative and public-private partnerships.
              However, we do not have the luxury of being able to put the clock
              forward 10 years, so we have to base our assessment on the
              evidence currently available. The Committee has therefore tried to
              present as balanced a view as possible of that evidence, given
              that some of it is inconclusive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a number of important points that
              raise various issues. First, the provision of public services,
              which really started to accelerate from the post-war reforms, has
              meant that 50 years later the Government have become a huge owner
              and manager of property. Government Departments are now starting
              to question whether that should be such a major activity of
              government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has recently heard from the
              buildings and maintenance section of the Department of Finance and
              Personnel. It has put on the table a bill for £37 million for
              urgently required refurbishment to key buildings. The spending and
              prioritisation of that money, and the awarding of the contracts,
              will be a big job. Over the next few years, it will inevitably
              involve a great deal of effort. That is an example of an ongoing
              activity that the Government are confronting.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members are familiar with the figures involved
              in the education sector, where £500 million is required to
              address the shortfall in school buildings. At current rates of
              spending from traditional procurement methods, that will probably
              take somewhere in the region of 15 years — perhaps longer — to
              achieve. During those 15 years, other bills will land.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Education in particular has
              been active in using PPPs because it can, in effect, bring some of
              that expenditure forward. To some extent, it means spending
              tomorrow’s money today. If £60 million can be spent every year
              on school buildings, that will mean £600 million being spent over
              10 years. By financing the activity through the private sector and
              paying for it in instalments, the building programme can be
              brought forward. However, it will have to be paid for in the end
              — one way or another.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a delusion among people that somehow
              or other you do not pay for it; you most certainly do pay for it
              — the public sector pays for it. If you buy something through
              hire purchase it is likely that you will pay a bit more for it
              than would otherwise be the case. However, one must balance that
              factor against the benefit of getting the use of the asset much
              earlier than would otherwise occur.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another point relating to schools was put to
              us, with considerable vigour, by the Department of Education and
              Science in Dublin. Departmental officials stressed to us the great
              benefit that schoolteachers derive from not having to be concerned
              with the management and maintenance of the building in which they
              work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The feeling in Dublin was that this was so
              valuable that it was not all that necessary for them to try to put
              a cost on it. They were in a much happier position than us. They
              have the money to meet all of their building requirements and can
              choose whether to do it by traditional public procurement or by
              some form of PPP.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a number of cases, they have deliberately
              chosen to use PPP because of the benefit they foresee in schools
              not having to be concerned with the problems of management and
              maintenance of buildings. Therefore one can draw a tentative
              conclusion that if it is cost-neutral between the traditional
              procurement and PPP alternatives, then the extra benefits tend to
              favour going down the PPP route.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even if there is some cost disadvantage in
              going down the PPP route, it may still be worthwhile if you think
              you will get extra benefits from how you will be able to use the
              facility. The difficulty is in trying to judge the size of the
              numbers involved over the lifetime of these projects — a typical
              period would be 20 to 30 years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is perhaps a tail-end benefit, and it
              relates to the current state of the Government estate. The
              Government own very fine Victorian buildings, which are not
              particularly helpful for modern use, though they were undoubtedly
              magnificent state-of-the-art buildings in their day. The same
              situation may occur now. In 30 years’ time we may own a building
              that was good to have in 2000 but does not suit its purpose in
              2030. It might be beneficial if such a building did not belong to
              the Government at that time. It could be put back into the lap of
              the private sector to do something else with, while the Government
              could contract for a new building that would be state-of-the-art
              in 2030.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When you are building, one of the advantages
              you are likely to get through PPP is that you will receive the
              best of private sector innovation, and you are likely to get the
              benefit of leading-edge construction techniques.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the private service provider would be
              responsible for maintaining the building, it would have to assess
              carefully the trade-off between how much it spends on construction
              and how much it will have to spend on maintenance. Under public
              procurement, the tendency would be to save money now, but possibly
              pay for that with maintenance costs in the future. The way in
              which that particular cake is divided is one of the cores of
              controversy concerning the worthiness of PPPs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is another issue arising, and it is one
              that is particularly topical at the moment. It concerns the fate
              of public service employees if a private service provider takes
              over the part of the public service in which they work. We heard a
              considerable amount of evidence from trade unions on this matter.
              We also heard from the private sector. The Government at
              Westminster have made some pronouncements on this matter recently
              regarding health service employees. It was said that they could be
              seconded to the private sector. We have not heard a detailed
              reaction from the private sector about this yet. However, I
              strongly suspect that it may prove to be much more difficult in
              practice than the Government imagine. I do not think that that
              will be the last word on this subject.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I did not find the evidence presented to us
              about the potential problems for public service employees
              particularly convincing. It seemed to me that the evidence for the
              emergence of a two-tier workforce implied that the private sector
              part of the workforce was the better tier to be in. I do not think
              that we would have heard so much about it if it were felt that
              public sector employees were in an advantageous position.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I acknowledge that the development of
              PPPs will remain a controversial issue for some time.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been talking mainly about buildings in
              relation to schools and hospitals. The Committee was focused, in
              its deliberations, on the built infrastructure deficit and did not
              look into the potential for providing public services through the
              private sector. Had it done so it would not have come up with much
              enthusiasm for going down that course. It is worth emphasising
              that we are talking about the deficit in the built infrastructure
              and how that might be addressed in the short term.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Irrespective of whether infrastructure is built
              by public procurement or by public-private partnerships, the same
              construction firms are going to be involved. It is a question of
              the contract under which they carry out the activity. If we were
              to engage in a major programme of public-private partnerships with
              a view to accelerating the speed at which we renew and replace our
              public service infrastructure, the construction industry is going
              to have to gear up to meet that need. It is reasonable for the
              construction industry to require a clear plan laid down over some
              time so that it can gear up to meet the need.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turning away from the area of schools and
              hospitals, I want to talk about transport, which is the other
              principal area for using public-private partnerships. This is
              highly topical subject recently because of the ongoing wrangle
              about the London Underground. That example is not a helpful one,
              because the London Underground is a large- scale project, in
              excess of anything that would concern us. There are, however, some
              points of principle involved that are relevant to any city looking
              to improve its public transport.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When building schools and hospitals one simply
              looks at how to draw down forthcoming Government expenditure and
              how, through PPP, private finance might be mobilised to accelerate
              the rate of build. However when looking at transport there is a
              wider range of options. Public transport generates revenue in the
              form of fares, and the revenue stream provides an opportunity to
              raise money in other ways. Mention has been made of the use of
              bonds, although I am concerned at the undefined and imprecise way
              this is talked about. It is not likely that the Executive of the
              Northern Ireland Assembly are going to issue a bond. Going by
              previous experience, that would cause considerable difficulties
              with the Treasury. It is possible that there may be devices
              whereby a separate entity could be set up which owned a proportion
              of the fares of a public transport service and where those fares
              acted as security to service a bond. With that money it might be
              possible to expand the service to be provided. That is, however,
              predicated on the basis that the fare base is big enough. With our
              relatively small population, I suspect that we would be looking at
              an injection of public money as well. That is not a good reason
              for not getting involved in that; there may be a combined strategy
              there that would be suitable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the question of congestion
              charging, that is, charging people to take their cars into
              Belfast.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also possible to raise money through
              tolls. The key to this is the existence of sufficient demand for
              the use of the road for which you wish to charge a toll. It is
              preferable to have an alternative, so that the payment of the toll
              is an entirely voluntary act. For some reason people think that it
              is acceptable to pay a fare to travel by rail but that it should
              cost nothing to drive their car on a road. That is not necessarily
              realistic for a motorist who wants to travel at the same time as
              many others. However, if a motorist has the choice between queuing
              on an existing crowded road or paying a toll to drive down a brand
              new highway, he will eventually go down the new road when he is in
              a rush. After that he will never travel on the old road again.
              That has been the experience in regard to the toll roads in
              Dublin.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must be prepared to be imaginative, and
              there is a likelihood of short-term unpopularity until the
              benefits flow through. However, political parties must decide
              whether they are prepared to take on this responsibility in order
              to achieve a long-term benefit. We must remember that the payment
              of tolls and congestion charges is a voluntary act. There are
              other ways of travelling free of charge, but they might mean a
              longer journey.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I seem to have been talking for some time, Mr
              Speaker. I do not normally have this much time. I will try to wind
              up.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy:</p>
              </b>

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Absolutely. The question of whether Northern
              Ireland gets a fair deal from the Treasury under the Barnett
              formula frequently arises in the House. It is not useful to
              speculate about the creation of a new formula when making plans to
              address our infrastructure deficit. We must work with the figures
              that are currently available. If we were able to persuade the
              Treasury to give us more money, it would be a nice problem to
              have, and we would have no difficulty in allocating these funds.
              Realistically, we have to work with what we have now, and with
              conservative projections of what it will be worth in the future.
              We must remember that Northern Ireland receives some £10 billion
              from the Treasury, and our tax base is estimated at around only
              £5 billion. We therefore have to take the view that we are being
              treated generously.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are identifying the benefits of PPPs and the
              considerable problems involved, which are well highlighted in our
              report. One of the main benefits of PPPs is that they force
              Governments to plan and budget for the long term — not just to
              build things, but to maintain them to the same standard. By
              engaging in a contract for 30 years, a Government is tying up
              money for 30 years. By entering into more contracts, the
              Government ties up more money, which might otherwise have been
              available in, for example, 10 years’ time. Nonetheless, there
              are considerable opportunities for accelerating the rate at which
              we address our infrastructure deficit. Several of these would soon
              benefit Northern Ireland considerably.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Chairperson of the Committee has stated,
              this debate comes at an opportune time. This debate, its
              outworkings, and the decisions that will be taken in response to
              it, could shape decisions that affect our community for several
              years to come. They will have an impact on our society for many
              years.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is an unpalatable fact that the public
              infrastructure in Northern Ireland is in a very poor state. That
              is not an exaggeration — it is an understatement. It is
              estimated that several billion pounds are urgently required to put
              right the clear deficit in investment over the past 30 years, and
              to right the wrongs of neglect and violence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pages 47 and 48 of volume one of the report
              draw attention to the priorities published by the Executive in the
              Programme for Government in February 2001. The 33 paragraphs on
              those two pages should not be dismissed as a wish-list, but should
              be seen as the needs of our society if we are to achieve the goals
              that we have set ourselves.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will highlight some of those points, such as
              the need to provide for an anticipated 250,000 new households over
              the next 25 years and the need to address hospital waiting lists
              — 18% of patients in Northern Ireland have been on waiting lists
              for over 12 months. Community health and social care support also
              needs to be addressed, because there are 4,000 people waiting for
              that. Demographic changes clearly show that there will be
              increasing pressures on available resources.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The shortage of university places must also be
              addressed. Many young people leave Northern Ireland to further
              their education, and most of them do not return. The need to
              address the deficiencies in our roads, public transport, energy,
              telecommunications, and water and sewerage infrastructures has
              already been mentioned. By 2005, waste water treatment works must
              achieve 80% compliance with environmental and heritage standards.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The crux of the issue is that the Executive
              need to operate collectively to bring about the necessary
              improvements in the Barnett formula. Barnett does not recognise or
              adequately address the needs of the people of Northern Ireland. It
              is therefore incumbent on the Executive to operate collectively
              — and I stress the word &quot;collectively&quot; — to ensure
              that the Treasury gives financial expression to our needs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I live in the real world, and I recognise that
              waiting in hope for the justification of our needs in equity and
              fair play to be realised and recognised by the Treasury will take
              a long time. To do nothing is not an option in this situation. We
              must tackle our huge problems sooner rather than later, because
              time, in this respect, costs a lot of money. It is therefore
              imperative that alternatives be examined. The publication of our
              report comes at an opportune time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be wrong to see public-private
              partnerships as a panacea for all our ills. The cheapest money
              must be public finance. Any alternative must, by definition, be
              seen to be more expensive. Hire purchase is always more expensive
              than cash purchase.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be equally wrong to erect ideological
              barriers against public-private partnerships. Partnership
              undoubtedly has an important role to play, but lessons must be
              learned from the past. We must learn how to protect employees and
              avoid spending public money on bad employers. We need to recognise
              that risk ultimately lies with the public sector. We should not be
              drawn into heavily front-loaded contracts with no real idea of the
              full delivery costs over the full term of the contract. In short,
              we must see that value for money is the key over the full term.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must be conscious of the effects that
              long-term contracts will have in future, and we must demonstrate
              clearly that lessons have been learnt from the past. For example,
              we are still paying very dearly — very dearly — for long-term
              contracts in the privatisation of the electricity industry in
              Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report from the Finance and Personnel
              Committee sets down vitally important recommendations that are
              aimed at ensuring that we make progress in addressing
              underinvestment in a constructive, methodical and joined-up
              manner. Co-ordination must be the name of the game, and it must be
              done by a team headed by a Minister who will be responsible for
              driving forward a unified service- wide investment strategy that
              will have accepted and examined all possible options.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although our terms of reference were clearly
              focused on public-private partnerships and PFIs, whoever leads our
              investment strategy team should examine closely all alternatives
              and options, including what Mr Leslie called &quot;bonds&quot;. Mr
              Leslie should read a recent paper by Prof Austin Smyth and Jamie
              Delargy entitled ‘Bonds – a Capital Idea’. It emphasises the
              strong potential that bonds offer for dealing with our
              infrastructure deficit, and it draws particular attention to the
              non-profit owned company that deals with the Welsh water and
              sewerage system. I also draw attention to the recent ‘Building
              Better Partnerships’ report by one of the top think tanks. It
              gives an analytical breakdown of the pros and cons of PPPs and the
              direction in which we should go in future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report that the Finance and Personnel
              Committee produced after much work and thoughtful consideration
              should be the cornerstone upon which we build a centre of
              excellence for future investment and procurement. That goal should
              not be outside our reach. We have a golden opportunity to strive
              for excellence, and this report provides the cornerstone.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join the Chairperson of the Finance and
              Personnel Committee in expressing my gratitude to our staff who
              dealt admirably with a very complex and serious issue. The hours
              that they were obliged to work because of tight timescales must be
              recognised. Their admirable work has produced a report that should
              be a cornerstone for the future.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a very comprehensive report that left
              me with as many questions as it did answers on the way forward.
              The Chairperson of the Committee referred to the Department of
              Education and the Department of Further and Higher Education,
              Training and Employment, which are probably the only two
              Departments that can give us any detailed information. They were
              the only Departments to ask for additional funding in the spring
              Supplementary Estimates for last year, and as such I found very
              little detailed information on the report’s main
              recommendations. The report gave a guarded welcome to a greater
              introduction of PPPs. However, it seems to me that it does not
              have the information to make such a recommendation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Has the Committee considered referring some of
              these issues to the Civic Forum, particularly where a
              recommendation is made for a unified service-wide investment
              strategy? It is a novel idea, and it draws on the support of the
              voluntary and community sector and the private sector. Given that
              the Civic Forum involves those sectors as well as the trades
              unions, it may, for once, be useful for the Assembly or an
              Assembly Committee to ask the Civic Forum to put those sectors
              together to test their ideas on the way forward on public-private
              partnerships.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems to me that the issue is going the same
              way as many previous recommendations from the Executive, and that
              is to hand most of the work to an interdepartmental group that
              then relies on civil servants to bring the ideas forward. I
              suggest that we go to the sectors that work with the problems of
              finance and securing resources and ask for their views.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are four areas that the report needs to
              do more work on. First, there is the question of the openness,
              transparency and accountability of the public-private partnerships
              that are in place. Secondly, there is the issue of the impact of
              public-private partnerships on the community, particularly where
              the report refers to the need to meet the human rights and
              equality obligations set by the Executive. Thirdly, there is very
              little in the report about alternative methods of procurement,
              despite Mr Leslie’s views today. Seamus Close mentioned bonds,
              and there are many questions still to be answered and many
              technical problems with the Treasury’s views on public bonds.
              Finally, there is the issue of risk transfer.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The major issue is the lack of openness and
              transparency in public-private partnerships. The report explains
              how one individual asked for a business case, and even though
              there were commercial interests at stake, he could not get
              information about Transport 2000 from one Department. If we cannot
              get that information, how can we provide empirical data that shows
              that public-private partnerships work?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report states that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Project information does not appear to be
              kept in a uniform manner. This leads to inconsistent findings,
              making comparisons difficult, if not indeed impossible. Finally
              there appears to be an absence of research on the socio-economic
              impact of the individual projects on relevant communities.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that, how can the report reconcile its
              conclusion that, albeit cautiously, we should pursue public-
              private partnerships?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All the information seems to lie with the
              bidder or the contractor, so it is easy for them to demonstrate
              value for money because that depends on what they include or
              exclude and how they determine what costs will be counted and over
              what period. Some projects may be value for money but
              unaffordable. They can also be poor value for money and
              unaffordable. The difficulty is that schemes may be pruned to make
              them affordable, or that extra public resources — as we know has
              been the case — get thrown at them, hence the land sales, asset
              transfers, capital grants and capacity and service reductions that
              are so prominent in hospitals, schools and in the passport agency
              projects that we know about.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Experience in England indicates that the value
              of either private finance initiatives or public-private
              partnerships shows the estimated size of the capital element to be
              financed by the private sector but excludes the public sector
              contributions. That comes back to the point I made about the lack
              of transparency. I know from my own constituency that in general
              land sales and asset transfers were arranged with extremely
              advantageous terms for the private sector.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That brings me to the impact of public-private
              partnerships on local communities. We have section 75 and the
              Human Rights Act, and this is probably the most audited Assembly
              in the Western World — if not the entire world. Every policy
              must be audited and ticked off on how it impacts on certain
              categories of people and communities. However, we are going
              forward with a policy without knowing what its impacts will be.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me give Members an example of one
              public-private partnership that did not work and was
              disadvantageous to a local community.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wellington College, which was in great need of
              replacement, went down the PPP road. A consortium of builders was
              put together under the name of Northwin Developments. The
              consortium put in a successful application for planning
              permission. However, a problem arose when the Department of the
              Environment told it that part of the land had been designated for
              playing fields. By this stage the consortium was now the owner of
              the land, and as the owner, it decided that it could do what it
              liked with the land. The consortium decided to put up more housing
              than had been scheduled in the original plans. It claimed that the
              land was left over after it had finished building the school.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The community was not against the new school or
              the first proposal for the number of houses to be built. However,
              as the planning process continued the community discovered that
              their playing fields, which was the only piece of open land they
              had, were also going to be built on. This was an interesting
              example, because the Department of the Environment said that the
              consortium could not build on the land, but the Department of
              Education said that the consortium owned the land and could
              therefore do what it wanted with it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I attended a public inquiry where a debate took
              place about what should happen and about what powers were
              available. Ultimately, it was extremely disadvantageous to the
              community to be told that they really did not have to be consulted
              about what happened to the playing fields.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to see the conditions that would be put
              on future PPPs. I did not see much about that in the report. I
              have great concerns too for the future if supermarkets and
              high-density developments were to be built on the small number of
              playing fields and green spaces that we have in a city such as
              Belfast. Undoubtedly, much of this is taking place because of
              developments between the public and the private sectors.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also have concerns about management. The
              report has some worrying conclusions and makes comments about
              schools being managed by people who have been a part of the
              contractual arrangements. Presumably this could apply to hospitals
              as well. Many questions still need to be asked.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have concerns about the difference between
              the objectives of the public and private sectors. The private
              sector has moral obligations to investors that take priority over
              social obligations to customers. On the other hand, we are told
              that the public sector is motivated by social responsibility and
              environmental awareness. Therein lies the crux of the problem: two
              sets of objectives that fly in the face of each other. Experience
              to date suggests that the private sector’s objectives will win
              over those of the public sector.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is scant mention of other methods of
              procurement in the report, although it talks about a non-profit
              making trust for infrastructure investment. However, that is all
              — it simply refers to it and says that it would require
              significant further development. The report more or less dismisses
              the idea out of hand. As well as non-profit making organisations,
              there are public bonds — and those leave as many questions as
              they answer. We really do not know what we are talking about here,
              and the report does not offer us much enlightenment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What are the alternative funding arrangements
              or methods of procurement? The terms of reference state that the
              Committee was looking specifically at public-private partnerships,
              but that does not forbid the opportunity to go into detail about
              what exists elsewhere, particularly as the Committee was
              attempting to examine international as well as national
              experiences.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We come to risk transfer and the whole-life
              costs of a project. The contractor is clearly in a very powerful
              position here. The risks may be minimal if the project works.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a public-private partnership does not work,
              the public sector will have to take on the risk and costs of that
              failure. The Executive must deliberate this question if they are
              to go down this road and hand the risk over to trusts and boards.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As an aside, if the Executive were to consider
              the option of bonds, I wonder how much credit a long-term investor
              would give us for a bond given the current state of the Assembly
              and the Executive. Failed private projects are very worrying.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is assuming that, at that stage, the asset
              has any worth. The providers that go bust are the ones who supply
              badly constructed buildings in the first place. We have seen
              examples of that in England — and they have come about as a
              result of shady deals. The partnerships that we want to invest in
              are those that do not have a high risk attached to them. The
              assets that have been handed over to the public sector — and as
              usual the poor public sector picks up the pieces — are those
              that have been dodgy from the outset.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people wonder whether it was value for
              money. The assets become affordable only because developers have
              cut so many costs and corners. Then, in order to manage the
              assets, the private sector providers must ask for more money from
              the public sector to keep going. The public sector continues to
              bail them out until eventually it has to take over.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, trade unions do not oppose these
              partnerships simply because of private funding. Nowadays, trade
              unions are trying to find out what is good value for money.
              However, they have urged a cautious approach, particularly where
              there are huge implications for workers. Which parts of the Health
              Service will remain as its profitable side? In contrast, which
              parts will be thought of as the poor sisters of the Health
              Service? That issue is a particularly interesting one for those of
              us who are involved in projects like mental health, rather than
              the acute side of the Health Service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most importantly, the report has not suggested
              criteria that can determine whether a project is suitable for PPPs.
              I hoped that this report would give us criteria that we might call
              &quot;useful pieces of audit&quot;, by which we could decide to
              tick off on a project. Those responsible for the report could not
              answer that — they said the information was not available to
              them. Ultimately, I am disappointed. I strongly commend the
              Committee for its initiative in undertaking the first stage of a
              much longer-term project for the examination of PPPs.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I would like to point out that the
              resources available under the existing Barnett formula are
              insufficient to meet the needs of our society. It would be
              desirable to have all our public services provided from public
              resources, but unfortunately that is not possible. Therefore we
              have to look at innovative means by which we can fund our public
              services. I am not advocating PPP or PFI for the sake of it.
              Rather we need to use those approaches because financial realism
              dictates that in-house financial turnover is inadequate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential to leave no step untaken in
              attempting to address the poisonous legacy of the underinvestment
              that occurred under direct rule. It is a system that the
              detractors of the Good Friday Agreement wish to return to. We must
              not only address underinvestment but increase resources so that we
              can achieve more ambitious targets for society.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, we could have three or four
              capital programmes through PFI or PPP that could be used in the
              future. We need to ensure that the effects of what we have talked
              about, with regard to joined-up government, are being delivered.
              We will need to ensure that we have a skilled workforce ready to
              deal with the demand.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that PPP or PFI initiatives be
              publicly accountable, be value for money and, most of all, be
              transparent. The reality, which has been touched on already by
              several Members, is that we need to increase the educational
              provision for our children, create better roads, build a stronger
              economy and increase and improve the care of our sick, elderly and
              most vulnerable. These ambitions drive us forward and spur us to
              action. However, if we are to achieve our goals we must back them
              up with a clearly thought out financial strategy. The PFI/PPP
              instrument is one — and only one — way of achieving those
              goals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we utilise the instruments of PFI and PPP,
              we need to ensure that we evaluate their pertinence and impact. We
              must realise, as Seamus Close said, that this is not a panacea for
              all our ills. However, we should not, and cannot, discount it
              before due consideration. That would be absurd and would be doing
              a great disservice to our people, especially those most in need.
              Whatever we do must be consistent with the core commitment to
              social and democratic objectives — the creation of equality of
              opportunity, targeting social need and high-quality public
              services. We need to derive benefits from the use of PPP. Indeed,
              we should have as a ministerial approach &quot;Ask not what your
              Department can do for PPP or PFI, rather what can PPP or PFI do
              for your Department’s needs&quot;. There is a need to properly
              examine this complex area, and I am sure that this report will
              contribute significantly to the debate. Furthermore, this is why I
              welcome the high level task force announced by the Minister of
              Finance and Personnel.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, properly used PFI and PPP, which
              will enable provision of services free at the point of delivery,
              can have a place in the overall financial strategy of any
              Administration. However, it should not — and I am sure will not
              — become an objective. Rather it should always remain a
              strategic option. At this point, I, like the other members of the
              Finance and Personnel Committee, wish to add my thanks and
              appreciation to the staff for their commitment and the tireless
              amount of work that they put into compiling this report, which I
              support.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this report by the Committee for
              Finance and Personnel. It is very comprehensive and includes
              evidence from a wide range of witnesses ranging from harsh critics
              of the idea of PPP through to people promoting the idea with
              evangelical zeal.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anybody who took the time to read the report
              will have noticed that several things became abundantly clear from
              the evidence. There is undoubtedly a major infrastructure deficit
              and a concern over the lack of delivery of public services.
              Reference was made to issues of devolution and direct rule.
              Certainly, infrastructure has suffered under direct rule, but it
              is not a problem relating solely to Northern Ireland. If you had
              followed all the issues in the general election, you would have
              seen widespread concern throughout the UK, and, indeed, beyond, at
              the lack of investment in public services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No matter how much we readjust Barnett, or look
              at moving it around, the advantage that can be brought purely by
              way of traditional public procurement methods is not going to be
              able to meet the full demands of public expectation and demand for
              increase in investment into public services and infrastructure. As
              indicated by the Minister, that route is simply not going to be
              sufficient. Consequently, we have to look at other means including
              PPP. I appreciate that the report takes a very cautious view to
              PPP, which I think is right. We are not in a position to be able
              to evaluate how PPP has worked at the end of a full life-size
              implementation of any of the projects, because we are still at the
              early stages.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is even more cautious on bond
              schemes, which are at a much earlier stage of development in, for
              example, the Department for Regional Development.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is right to keep an open mind as to which
              method we use to find additional investment for public services.
              It is clear that PPPs and perhaps bond schemes have to be
              considered, but it is important always to realise that they are
              only tools to achieve public investment. Be it PPP or anything
              else, we are looking at a means to an end rather than an end in
              itself. That is the crucial thing to remember.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has been slow to go down the
              road of PPP. Indeed, compared with the rest of the United Kingdom
              or the Republic of Ireland, we are well behind. While there is a
              certain disadvantage in that, we should take advantage of the
              adage and look elsewhere for examples of the route that we as a
              Province should take.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been said that a wise person learns by
              his mistakes, but an even wiser person learns by the mistakes of
              others. If we apply that adage, there are certain things in the
              report that can point to a direction by which I hope we can avoid
              some of the mistakes that have been made elsewhere. Particularly
              in its recommendations, the report concentrates less on a
              particular model for PPPs or bond schemes that is the panacea to
              all our problems, but looks at what is best practice and the
              structures that should apply. Thus, the idea of the need to pool
              experience and to pool that level of expertise throughout the
              Civil Service in order to provide the best infrastructure
              decisions is important.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The desire to co-ordinate very much runs
              through the recommendations, whether by way of having a Minister
              designated to look after the issue through the working group, or
              by way of the central investment body. All those things are
              focused on the key aims of pooling experience and expertise and of
              co-ordination. Here I take issue with some of the things that
              another Member said. Whatever route we take to deal with the
              infrastructure deficit — the current public procurement, bond
              schemes or PPPs (and it is likely to be some combination of those)
              — in years to come we will see a greater degree of private
              sector involvement. As such, the dichotomy between the traditional
              means of public procurement and PPP is perhaps not always as great
              as it is portrayed. If, for example, a school or hospital is being
              built, you can take the methodology of PPP and use that scheme,
              but even if you use the traditional procurement method you are
              contracting out the building of that school or hospital. Some of
              the risks that relate to the private sector will be there
              consistently, no matter which route you take.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several issues arise out of that. There is a
              need for a sustainable deal flow within any investment strategy.
              One of the concerns that several Members had at the start of the
              inquiry was that if we went down the route of PPP, the local
              private sector would be overwhelmed by the amount of contracts
              coming online, and that that would create problems.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, one piece of evidence that came from
              the local private sector was that its concern at the moment is the
              reverse — that the deals and contracts that have been made
              available by the public sector have been so insufficient, and so
              stuttering in their delivery, that there is a danger of not
              getting the opportunity to build up the level of expertise, and
              that the sustainable deal flow is not being created. Therefore we
              have to, via the methods that have been outlined in the report,
              produce that sustainable deal flow in order to ensure that local
              firms in Northern Ireland are best able to deal with the problems
              they are facing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are facing some sort of mix of public
              procurement and PPP in the future. There are benefits to be gained
              from the competition between those two sectors that will be
              beneficial to the public purse. There is also the issue of
              standardisation of contracts to ensure that there is transparency,
              but also that we do not have undue cost and undue delay in
              fulfilling some of these deals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the issue of value for money. It
              is important that we do not simply look at the cheapest route to
              produce a particular infrastructure. Indeed, as has been said, it
              would be a mistake to do so. Some of the qualitative issues must
              also be considered in relation to the benefits of PPP, as outlined
              by James Leslie and others, such as the freeing-up of resources.
              If the contractors not only design and build a building but also
              operate the building, they have a greater incentive not to cut
              corners and to provide something that is sustainable for the long
              term.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PPP and public procurement as a whole must be
              used as a means to an end and as a device to accelerate public
              investment. However, care must be taken that in dealing with
              long-term contracts we do not tie up so much public investment as
              to reduce flexibility for the future. The opportunity exists for
              the public sector to ensure that resources can be reallocated in
              the future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report’s recommendations map out a
              sensible and cautious way forward to deal with the public sector
              investment deficit. Unless we start tackling the infrastructure
              issue now, and through the method put forward by the Committee, we
              will only be storing up trouble for the future. This is a
              cautious, but realistic, way forward, and I commend the report to
              the House.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel (Mr
              Durkan):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like other Members, I welcome the report of the
              Committee for Finance and Personnel on public-private
              partnerships. It is, as some Members have said, very timely. It
              deserves serious consideration by all of us with an interest in
              the future development of the infrastructure of our public
              services. It is a weighty and wide-ranging report. If I wanted to
              be cheeky, I might say that we are being asked to debate a report
              of great weight and size, and we have only had a few days to
              consider it. I could turn the tables on the usual complaint that
              is made against myself and the Executive by the Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amount of work that has gone into the
              report — and importantly the amount of work that should flow
              from the report and follow up on some of its ground-turning work
              — means that it does not come to the end of its life cycle just
              by virtue of this debate. This is a take-note debate; we are not
              coming to full determinations or conclusions about any of the
              report’s recommendations. The report itself rightly points out
              that further work must be done on a number of issues and that
              there are other issues that we must explore, but it gives good
              pointers as to the premises on which that future work should be
              based.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Executive have emphasised in the
              Programme for Government, the resources available from the
              taxpayer are finite and are stretched by the need to provide for
              services at greater levels of need than the UK average. The
              Executive must address a legacy of historical underfunding, which
              many Members have referred to, in the infrastructure of our public
              services. Currently many parts of the public services, especially
              health, education and transport, require levels of capital
              investment far in excess of the resources that are available if we
              are to simply fund them in the traditional manner. It is essential
              that the Executive and Departments explore new ways of financing
              and providing services such as public-private partnerships and the
              range of forms that they might take, providing they are
              affordable, deliver value for money and provide effective
              solutions to meet the needs of our public services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to examine all options carefully and
              objectively, and to develop a clear policy in this area. All those
              points are underlined at various stages in the report, and in
              various ways by many of those who gave evidence to the Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under direct rule, our vital services were
              underfunded for years. Those issues are not confined solely to
              direct rule. I do not pretend that they are simply a function of
              direct rule, but the historic reality is that we have a legacy of
              underinvestment. The Executive are determined to break those
              patterns, but, as we have already stressed, the resources
              available for funding our public services are limited and
              hard-pressed, and are already stretched by the need for us to
              provide services at greater levels of need than elsewhere.
              Therefore we have to research and examine carefully how we fund
              and deliver public services, not least — but not only — in
              areas such as health and education.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one should be under the illusion that there
              is a miracle cure. Solutions that focus on alternative sources of
              borrowing are not sufficient because of the way the spending rules
              operate, and I will come to that point again when dealing with the
              questions Members raised about bonds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise that recently there has been
              considerable media coverage of this subject, including concerns
              expressed in certain quarters — especially by trade unions —
              about the use of public-private partnerships in delivering public
              services. In addition, the recently published report by the
              Institute of Public Policy Research in London, which some Members
              referred to, provides further evidence about the use of PPPs that
              also deserves careful consideration. The high-level working group
              being set up to review the use of PPPs in public services by March
              2002, in accordance with commitments set out in the Programme for
              Government, will address these issues. I will soon be giving the
              Committee for Finance and Personnel a copy of the terms of
              reference that I have agreed with the Office of the First Minister
              and the Deputy First Minister. Copies will be placed in the
              Assembly Library in due course.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The working group will take into account
              evidence from many quarters on the benefits and constraints of
              using PPP. It will also look at the report published last week by
              the Institute of Public Policy Research, and, in particular, the
              report published today by the Committee for Finance and Personnel
              and the many helpful pointers that it gives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not propose to deal with the detailed
              recommendations of the report now, with one exception that I will
              come to soon. The recommendations deserve serious consideration
              and not some knee-jerk or summary response. The quality and detail
              of the work that was put into the report, both by those who made
              submissions and by those who worked to put the report together,
              deserves equally thorough consideration.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to express a debt of thanks that the
              Assembly owes to the Committee for being able to gather such a
              wide cross-section of views and input from all sectors, not just
              from here but from further afield, in what is a very important and
              complex subject.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That wide spectrum of views is, in itself,
              important to acknowledge. The evidence gathered as a result will
              be all the more valuable as a source of information upon which the
              PPP working group established on behalf of the Executive will be
              able to build in its deliberations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said that I did not want to dwell unduly on
              any particular recommendations in the report. However, I think it
              would be helpful to pick up on some of the points that have been
              made in the debate. I do not necessarily want to reply to them but
              to join in the exchange of observations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members raised concerns or reflected
              concerns expressed by others. It is clear that public service
              employees have a number of misgivings about developments in this
              field. I understand and appreciate those, and many of them arise
              from particular experiences of previous private finance initiative
              projects that have taken place elsewhere. We are all learning a
              number of lessons. The report properly reflects some of those
              fears. It highlights some of the downsides but also emphasises
              that action can be taken to minimise those and to maximise
              advantages.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference was made to proposals from the Labour
              Government with regard to the NHS. I should point out that they
              are confined to pilot projects that are to be reported on by the
              end of the year. I am not aware of any commitment to extend
              secondment of public sector employees to private operators.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">James Leslie made the point that has been made
              elsewhere in the media recently about a comparison with hire
              purchase. I am not disputing that comparison on some levels.
              However, people need to recognise — as Mr Leslie did — that
              there can be advantages in terms of better value for money in the
              service delivered and scope for third party revenue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also need to remember that it is not always
              necessarily best for the public to own and manage as many
              buildings as it might need to use for any given purpose. There can
              be advantages in sweating assets to get the best overall benefit.
              There are issues in the context of resource accounting and
              budgeting that we cannot ignore.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members referred to bonds. As Peter Weir
              pointed out, the report from the Committee is very measured and
              reasonable in its approach to this issue. The idea of bonds has
              been explored before now; it is not entirely new. We all need to
              understand, as some Members have reflected, that bonds are just a
              form of borrowing. They do not necessarily open new doors for us.
              I remind Members that we are subject to a departmental expenditure
              limit.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As my officials keep telling me, it does
              exactly what it says on the tin. Borrowing does not allow us to
              spend more. Bonds might help us as part of a wider PPP approach if
              the private partner can avail of advantageous borrowing terms, but
              the concept of acquiring capital in this way, as it is being sold
              at the minute, is not as effective a solution as one might think.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In regard to the Welsh Water model, we need to
              understand that a high credit rating is needed to acquire
              servicing bonds on the international bond market. One Member asked
              what credit rating we, as a regional Administration, would be
              given in current circumstances. We should recognise that the Welsh
              Water credit rating was achieved only after privatisation and 10
              years of capital investment of £2·5 billion. We need to remember
              that all that glisters is not necessarily gold.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monica McWilliams discussed the sale of surplus
              assets as part of PPP deals and the idea that such action is like
              selling the family’s silver to meet today’s needs. Such
              assets, if they are part of PPP deals, must be clearly determined
              as being surplus to requirements for the foreseeable future. That
              can release value that can enhance the affordability of deals. If
              surplus assets are not disposed of they become a drain on public
              expenditure resources, particularly in the context of resource
              accounting and budgeting.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie said that PPP requires long-term
              budgeting. Under resource accounting and budgeting, the
              procurement of an asset by conventional means leads to a call on
              the resource budget for as long as the asset is held. Resource
              accounting and budgeting means that we will bear the cost of
              holding assets and that will be a real cost. There will always be
              the choice of selling the asset. We must consider the idea of
              holding and managing only those assets that we need to provide
              priority services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When introducing the Government Resources and
              Accounts Bill, I said that in the context of resource accounting
              and budgeting the Assembly will be controlling not only the flow
              and allocation of expenditure but the stock of assets that it
              possesses. We therefore need to take this into consideration.
              Potential conflicts of objective between the private and public
              sectors were mentioned. We need to ensure that we negotiate terms
              and arrangements that give us contracts that tie private sector
              aims and methods to the achievement of public sector requirements
              at the best available cost to ourselves.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report rightly registers the idea of a
              not-for-profit trust, but it does not go into handstands on the
              subject. We looked at the matter at official level and came to the
              same conclusion. We are not conclusively negative, but we remain
              unclear about how much of a contribution that approach might make.
              We have not ruled out further exploration but have indicated that
              it is not as easy an answer as has been suggested. I accept that
              the report does not suggest any easy answer in that regard, or in
              any other respect. The report calls for much hard work to be
              carried out in regard to many difficult issues in order to deliver
              much needed services and to reduce the many difficulties that
              exist across a range of services. An operator will only get paid
              if services are provided to the standards contracted for. At worst
              in a PFI deal, the asset will revert to public service ownership.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At one level, the Department needs to ensure
              that there is greater understanding of the various interests in
              the impetus that there would be in any deal, particularly if we
              are trying to bring forward new models. I am particularly
              interested in the Committee’s emphasis on the need to ensure
              service-wide developments. That is not on a basis of one size
              fitting all. However, there needs to be enough information and
              openness about developments to make sure that best practice can be
              broadcast, replicated and picked up by others.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equally, we have to bear in mind that there
              will be a need for a degree of commercial confidentiality. Too
              much disclosure might do more to prevent us getting better deals
              in the future than to ensure that we get better deals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monica McWilliams suggested referring the
              report to the Civic Forum. I have no argument with the Forum being
              recruited to look at any issue. However, in making her
              observation, Prof McWilliams said that the interdepartmental
              working group looking at the issues would consist only of civil
              servants. I must point out that the working group will comprise
              representatives from all sectors — the private, public and
              voluntary sectors and the trade unions. It will work on an open
              and organic basis to turn over a number of the issues that have
              been well opened by the report and that we need to consider
              further, as the report rightly requests us to do.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point about the working group’s being
              able to involve a range of social interests brings me back to one
              of the key recommendations in the report. It advocates that the
              support of key players, such as the private and voluntary sectors
              and local communities, be sought and that a social partnership
              approach should be used to achieve that support. That is a
              significant and healthy proposal. It is entirely in tune with the
              Executive’s desire to secure widespread support for how public
              services are to be developed and delivered in the future. It is
              consistent with the Department’s plans for the composition of
              the high-level working group.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Finance and Personnel is
              committed to exploring funding opportunities in these islands and
              beyond. That will also be reflected in the composition of the
              working group.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The notion of social partnerships helping to
              bring new light and dimensions to the concept of PPPs is timely.
              It rhymes well with the emphasis that the Executive have been
              placing on the development of the partnership model in the context
              of the next round of EU programmes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recall an earlier exchange in the House
              concerning EU programmes when I said that the local strategy
              partnerships might have an influence not only on what local
              government or statutory agencies were doing but also on some
              private finance decisions. Some Members asked what I meant, and
              they wondered how those socially based local partnerships could
              have that sort of influence. Therefore the thinking of the
              Committee rhymes very well with the thinking of the Executive in
              that regard.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is noteworthy that the report reflects a
              cross-party consensus in the Committee for Finance and Personnel
              on the use of PPPs.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In that respect it reinforces the view that it
              is only through various forms of partnership, including PPP, that
              we can realistically hope to see the type of modern, well-
              resourced and well-managed public services that our people deserve
              in the twenty-first century.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Committee and its staff for
              producing a report on this complex issue in such a relatively
              short time. I assure Members that the findings will be taken into
              account fully in the months ahead as the PPP working group
              undertakes its task. I can say with every confidence that the
              Committee for Finance and Personnel will make sure that its
              findings and recommendations for further work will be followed up
              by the Department and the Executive.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
              thank the Minister and all of the Members who participated in the
              debate. I welcome the support or otherwise for the report and the
              Minister’s agreement on the need to tackle the deficit urgently
              and constructively.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie mentioned the ownership of buildings.
              It is a very important issue. In relocating Government offices,
              the fact that the Government own buildings means that it can be
              difficult to locate elsewhere. We found that there were
              difficulties when there were old buildings that were no longer
              serviceable. We felt that a complete break had to be made
              sometimes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support Seamus Close’s statement about the
              Barnett formula. Further work needs to be done in order to address
              the matter. The Minister cautioned that in raising the issue of
              the Barnett formula we also have to come up with alternatives to
              it. Our report is partly concerned with that matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monica McWilliams said that the report does not
              give clear indications. We recognise that quite a lot of work has
              to be done. The aim of the report is to start debate in the
              Assembly and in the Executive about the direction we should take.
              We hope that we have addressed some of the issues and concerns
              that she raised.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We would welcome a wider debate within the
              Civic Forum. There was nothing to stop members of the Civic Forum
              answering our advertisement for people to come forward and give
              evidence. It is important that we mention that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ongoing review of PPP by the Office of the
              First Minister and the Deputy First Minister will consider all of
              this, and that is another aspect. We agree that there is a need
              for transparency, and that is one of the issues that came up in
              the report. However, there is also the issue of confidentiality.
              Sometimes it is not in the best interests of the Assembly, or for
              the public purse, to divulge information that will be of benefit
              to those who are in competition. We must achieve a balance. The
              Committee recognised that all of the information should be
              available, and that is one of the issues that we have highlighted.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to state that the Committee is
              not recommending that we go down the road of PPP; we are saying
              the opposite. We are saying that PPP may be used in a number of
              different occasions, and that in certain circumstances it could be
              beneficial. However, it is not to be used in all circumstances. It
              is not the be-all and end-all.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is trying to put together a strategy
              to help deal with PPP and other finance issues and to put together
              a structure that will ensure that investment is achieved in
              whatever contracts are entered into. We have looked at that
              situation thoroughly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of land sales arose during our
              investigations. The Committee advocates that the social
              partnership approach in dealing with investment needs to be in
              consultation with the local community and with its involvement. It
              does not mean simply paying lip service to local consultations or
              the community view but taking their ideas on board.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the recommendations that arose from our
              consultations was that land was not a good mechanism for putting
              together a partnership. It is best to take the land issue out of
              the matter completely, and it would then be clear what you were
              dealing with in pure cash terms.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams stated that we had dismissed the
              not-for-profit trusts, but to the contrary we marked that up as an
              alternative, and we had long discussions on the matter. We did not
              want to go down the road of having PPPs as the only means of
              raising finance; we wanted to deal with the alternatives. This
              inquiry was dealing with PPPs, and to institute another
              investigation into bonds and other methods would have taken the
              Committee into a diversion. The report endeavoured to stay within
              the terms of reference.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are recommending to the Executive that we
              look at alternatives. The Committee recognised the need to
              determine value for money by establishing the risks to be
              transferred and to put that structure together.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One thing that came across very clearly in a
              number of projects that we considered here, in Dublin and in
              England was the fact that contractors operated a better build
              policy, because they knew that they would be responsible for
              maintaining the building for 25 or 30 years. It was pointed out
              that the contractors actually changed the type and strength of
              materials that go into the building of a school or other structure
              when they realised that part of the contract involved the
              maintenance of that building. That is one of the advantages that
              we pointed up.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">School buildings are underutilised. With this
              particular type and design of project there is the opportunity for
              communities to use the buildings in a more inclusive way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley mentioned that PPP was a tool in the
              mechanism of dealing with the deficits. I welcomed the Member’s
              comment that there must be a continuous assessment and
              revaluation. That is part of the whole process, not just at the
              first stage and then it is over and done with. The Dublin people
              went for continuous revaluation and looking at situations with a
              view to making money.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir mentioned the Committee’s caution in
              relation to PPP. I agree with him that it is too early to evaluate
              fully the impact of these projects. None of them has been running
              for long enough to carry out a proper assessment. I do not know
              where some Members got the idea that buildings built under the PPP
              initiative were falling down around us; we found that these
              projects had not been in existence long enough to fall down.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The deal flow idea came across from the
              business community, and that is to do with investment by the
              private sector. We need to send a clear direction that we are
              dealing with investment; it is not just PPP. There is an
              opportunity for investment there.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The quality of building has to be taken into
              account, and the report points out the danger of PPP projects
              falling apart, because they do not have a proper deal flow.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel dealt
              with the issue of affordability and value for money and stated
              that there are no miracle cures. The fact that there are no
              miracle cures is one of the issues that we strongly pointed up in
              the report. There are some projects that will be of benefit if we
              go down this road, but PPP is not the panacea for everything. We
              have to look at the options. Some avenues we may not go down at
              all, and public finance may be the preferred option if that were
              available.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the issue of privatisation, there is a
              danger of the mistakes and baggage of the past being repeated in
              respect of the privatisation of the present Health Service and
              other services. This was not done well in the past, and the
              involvement of trade unions brought the issue into question. We
              should not confuse privatisation with PPP or finance-raising
              mechanisms.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That may be the case for some. However, as
              James Leslie pointed out, most of the people that we talked to
              said that those who transferred to the private sector would not
              return to the public sector.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s commitment to the
              social partnership. This issue was discussed in our Dublin
              meetings. There was involvement from all the different partners
              — the trade unions, the employers and various other structures
              — in putting together this type of project. Putting that social
              partnership together was the means of ensuring that there was
              continuity, that all the issues were addressed and that there was
              a mechanism for comeback.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We found the same thing when we talked to
              people who were managing schools. The maintenance of the building
              was taken out of their hands, and they were free to run
              educational establishments and not simply act as caretakers. They
              had an opportunity to put someone in charge of a building’s
              maintenance, and the contractor had the overall responsibility.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has been a useful debate. It is to be
              hoped that the report will be of benefit to all in the future and
              that along with this debate it sets the scene for further work.
              The Minister is correct in saying that we are simply marking out
              work for the future. It is the role of the Executive and the
              Committees to scrutinise and to ensure that the infrastructure and
              investment is tackled in this way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Finance and Personnel will
              return to this subject in the autumn when the Finance Minister
              will report to the Committee on his consideration of the report
              and its recommendations. I trust that there will be an opportunity
              for the Assembly to hear about agreement and real progress for
              investment in the future.</p>

              </font></b><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members know, Adjournment debates afford
              them the opportunity to raise issues concerning their
              constituencies. I have chosen to raise the issue of tourism in the
              North Antrim area. I welcome the opportunity to do this in the
              last Adjournment debate of this session, and possibly of this
              Assembly, given what happened at the beginning of the week.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday the House debated the Department for
              Regional Development’s strategy, which mentions a number of key
              strategic issues concerning tourism in Northern Ireland. These
              have some relevance when applied to our constituencies. Today we
              debated and progressed the Industrial Development Bill, which is
              also relevant when we consider its proposals on the functions of
              the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. Now we can discuss tourism
              specifically in the context of a constituency. All three issues
              are therefore linked. In Northern Ireland nothing happens in a
              vacuum, so they are linked by the long-term strategy for Northern
              Ireland and the organisation for delivering that strategy for
              tourism in North Antrim.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tourism relies on a strategy, and if it is to
              be successful in constituencies and not just in Northern Ireland
              as a whole, it is essential to have a strategy for each area. I
              hope that such a strategy exists. I would be interested to hear
              the Minister’s response to a number of points that I intend to
              raise during this debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Industrial Development Bill’s
              proposals regarding the functions of the Tourist Board. These will
              be helpful, especially in focusing on specific constituency
              issues. I will give that a fair wind.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said, in Northern Ireland nothing happens
              in a vacuum. Foot-and-mouth disease was not specifically related
              to farming in North Antrim. It was related to the entire business
              of Northern Ireland — Northern Ireland plc.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Foot-and-mouth disease had a devastating effect
              on tourism and on farming in my constituency; at the peak of the
              disease tourist numbers fell. Bed and breakfasts, hoteliers and
              restaurateurs all suffered financially. I hope that the Minister
              can introduce recovery plans for his areas of responsibility.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a neighbouring constituency to mine the
              North West 200 was cancelled. That was a devastating blow to my
              constituency because it robbed the area of holidaymakers, day
              trippers and visitors to the races and the practice sessions. It
              had an effect on the number of people who stayed and spent money.
              That effect must be addressed through a recovery plan.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The responsibility falls to several Ministers,
              not just to Sir Reg Empey, and I hope that there is some joined-up
              government action such as rate rebates for bed and breakfasts,
              hoteliers and restaurateurs. Special emergency grants would help
              them bridge the gap between this year’s season and next year’s.
              I hope that those businesses are given assistance to upgrade their
              facilities so that they become much more attractive holiday
              destinations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope too that there will be consequential
              compensation for the tourist industry, as that would be very
              helpful to my constituency. However, I appreciate that not all
              those things are in the remit of the Minister of Enterprise, Trade
              and Investment. I urge him to make that case to the Prime Minister
              and to other Colleagues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Regional Development’s
              strategy made some specific points about tourism generally in
              Northern Ireland and my constituency in particular. It sets the
              scene for the future and for a constituency-specific strategy. If
              we are to strengthen Northern Ireland we must enhance its
              attractiveness to international and local tourists.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have full confidence in the owners of bed and
              breakfasts, hotels and restaurants throughout Northern Ireland.
              However, they need encouragement, encouragement that should not be
              misinterpreted as interference. Those businesses should be
              encouraged to have a free hand to develop tourism, not to hinder
              it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that Northern Ireland can attract
              tourists and offer them something when they get here. Getting
              tourists hooked on Northern Ireland is one thing; keeping them in
              the Province, encouraging them to return to North Antrim to see
              the Glens, Slemish or the Giant’s Causeway is a different thing
              altogether.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are successful as a magnet for worldwide
              tourism we must recognise the implications it will have for
              Northern Ireland’s development. We shall have to build
              partnerships between the public and private sectors, and that
              flows directly from the last debate. It is essential that those
              partnerships be established.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We require joined-up government. Any tourism
              strategy must have a location infrastructure to allow tourists
              easy access to the area. In my constituency it is very difficult
              to get planning permission for bed and breakfasts and motels. The
              Department for Regional Development’s strategy, which the House
              debated yesterday, recommends that motels and bed and breakfasts
              be at the edge of towns or at major tourist crossroads, preferably
              on regional transport networks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recently had great trouble trying to convince
              the planners in my constituency of the need for a bed and
              breakfast motel/coffee-house facility along the A26 outside
              Ballymoney. Such a facility is missing. People who would normally
              just pass through the area could stay overnight. That could be
              critical for local business.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland also has the potential, as has
              my constituency, to offer itself as a major area for sports
              tourism. I know that the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and
              Investment has some interest in that, given his time on the Sports
              Council. I hope that the opportunity is given to develop a
              world-class region, whether it be for golfing facilities or to
              host golfing events. Developers should be given the opportunity to
              build world-class golf courses, unhindered by unnecessary and
              restrictive planning considerations. I hope the planners will
              permit the development of these facilities in picturesque areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This should not be limited to golf courses.
              Members will know that I have a particular interest in motor
              sport, and I hope that the Minister is prepared to press the case
              for a specially designed motor sport facility. I would prefer it
              to be in my constituency, but if that is not possible I do not
              really mind. I hope that he is pressing his party and ministerial
              Colleague to make an announcement soon on the issue of a
              dedicated, state-of-the-art, modern motor sport centre. Northern
              Ireland requires that vision if it is to capitalise on the tourism
              opportunities available, and from those will flow economic and
              social opportunities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a need for a destination resort
              concept. In many constituencies people whose normal reaction would
              be &quot;Not in my back yard&quot; would cry out &quot;Please put
              it in my back yard&quot;. I hope that the new tourism board will
              be able to come up with that destination resort concept. I make a
              bid now that it should go to North Antrim, and I hope it gets
              there very soon. I heard it said on a radio programme not so long
              ago that we do not want a &quot;Disney-type experience&quot;.
              Northern Ireland needs such an experience — apart from this
              place — and certainly requires something that will attract
              tourists, provide a focus for them and to which they will return
              year in, year out. I hope that efforts are being made to draw up
              such a strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently I met with people from the Mid-Glens
              Foot- and-mouth Disease Regeneration Group, who reiterated the
              view of a strategy for North Antrim. They said that it is
              necessary to emphasise that the Glens are back in business,
              whether farming, tourism or any other. The Minister has a
              responsibility to really beat that drum, and the sooner people
              hear that the sooner we can recover some of what was lost in the
              early part of the tourist season.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How do we assess the current tourism policy in
              North Antrim? I suppose a school report might read
              &quot;misdirected at times&quot;, &quot;tries very hard but can
              get distracted&quot; and &quot;overall, could do a lot
              better&quot;. That would not be the most satisfactory result, but
              I am not here to knock either the tourist industry or the tourism
              board. They have a very difficult job to do, but even if we
              appreciate the difficulties they face we must make sure that they
              try a lot harder and are given every encouragement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In North Antrim we offer magnificent tourism
              opportunities. Slemish, the Glens and the Giant’s Causeway
              provide some of the most spectacular countryside for the visitor.
              The visitor, however, requires places to stay and things to do.
              Many of Northern Ireland’s key destinations do not compare
              favourably with such equivalents as the Lake District or the
              Cotswolds with regard to overall visitor experience. Increasing
              the visitor experience is a key issue, and I hope that the
              Minister can indicate how he intends to do that in my
              constituency.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB)
              figures for self-catering facilities demonstrate the problems that
              exist. In Northern Ireland in 1995, 8,795 weeks were sold; that
              accounts for about 54% of the available space. In 1999 that had
              fallen to 41%, and there has been no real growth in the number of
              weeks sold since.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the north-east the NITB figures show that in
              1995 occupancy was at 57%. However, in 1999 — the last year for
              which figures are available — 3,550 weeks were sold, accounting
              for about 39% of total occupancy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of that drop can be accredited to seasonal
              issues such as the Drumcree factor. However, not all of it can,
              and we must face up to that. The fact is that, if it is to
              increase, the tourist experience must be developed with a
              strategy. I hope that the Minister can outline what that strategy
              will be for my constituency in particular.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The NITB has figures that show the level of
              tourism- related employment. The Minister knows that Moyle is an
              employment black spot. The jobs issue there is critical. Of all of
              the areas in my constituency, Moyle is crucially in need of jobs.
              One or two jobs could make a difference because it is so small.
              However, the NITB figures claim that, in 1995, 3,575 people were
              employed in the north Antrim area. By 1999 there seemed to have
              been impressive growth with 5,054 people employed in the hotel and
              tourist sector. That growth looks good on paper, but what is it
              based on? It is not based on actual jobs, but on what the small
              print in the NITB report refers to as</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;full-time equivalent jobs supported by
              tourism spend and estimated as a proportion of total spend.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That shows that they are not real jobs — the
              figures were massaged. I hope that the Minister can provide
              Members with the real figures, and I suggest that the number is
              considerably lower than the 5,054 that were indicated. The new
              Invest Northern Ireland (INI) board has taken on some of the
              powers of the NITB, and I hope that it can produce more accurate
              figures and that the Minister can give us that assurance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An important strategic review of the Giant’s
              Causeway called ‘Managing Our Future’ was published in 1997.
              It was drawn up by several Government agencies including the NITB,
              the Department of the Environment, the Department of Economic
              Development, the National Trust and Moyle District Council. People
              ask whether there is a strategy for the area. According to that
              document there is. However, is that plan in operation today? What
              progress has been made on the implementation of the issues that
              that strategy identified?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everything that I hear from some people who are
              involved in the NITB suggests that we do not want premature growth
              or to go off at a particular tangent and that we should slow down
              tourism development. That is the wrong approach. Northern Ireland,
              and my constituency, needs tourism development, and it should not
              be slowed down because there is no strategy. The reality is that
              there is a strategy. Can the Department report back on how it is
              being implemented? I accept that development must be part of a
              strategy, but that plan must come into operation sooner rather
              than later.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Minister agrees that too much
              dilly- dallying has gone on. It is not enough to dilly-dally on
              these issues. Hard sweat must be spilt to deliver a strategy. I
              hope that the Minister agrees that a strategy must revolve around
              more than a cup of tea and a bun. It was put to me recently that a
              cup of tea and bun would send a tourist on his or her way. I hope
              that the tourist stays for much more than that.</p>

              enjoy the hospitality that is on offer. The strategy should be
              considerably more than mere hit-or-miss visits by tourists.
              Visitors deserve an unforgettable tourism experience. If we do not
              provide that, we will be destined to repeat what a diarist and
              writer wrote about Northern Ireland tourism one hundred years ago,
              namely — and it was said of the Giant’s Causeway — that it
              was</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot; worth seeing, but not worth going to
              see&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that we, and the people of our country
              and my constituency will be able to say that the Giant’s
              Causeway is not only worth seeing but that it is worth going to
              see and worth going to see again and again because of the visitor
              experience. That has to be the mission statement, and I hope that
              the Minister can comment favourably on that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a Northern Ireland Tourist Board visitor
              satisfaction survey from its final report in 2000. The Tourist
              Board has rightly identified many of the problem areas such as
              poor standards of service and overpriced food products. The
              Tourist Board also identified other issues, such as litter, that
              are not directly associated with it but which affect tourism and
              which must be addressed. Despite identifying those problems, the
              survey produces some interesting results. Some 69% of respondents
              said that they would return to Northern Ireland for a holiday.
              That is very encouraging, but we must address the concerns. In a
              similar survey, the Republic of Ireland and Scotland recorded
              higher levels of customer satisfaction. We must work on increasing
              customer satisfaction in my constituency and across Northern
              Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Tourist Board’s report
              identified the fact that the product is not perceived to be cost-
              competitive. Food in some areas can be expensive and
              disappointing. I must say, however, that if the Minister wants a
              list of good restaurants in North Antrim, I will be happy to
              provide him with one, whatever his tastes may be. We must improve
              the service and the experience that we provide for tourists and
              which they expect. Budget accommodation needs to be improved, and
              street cleanliness in many areas falls below visitor expectations.
              We need more tourist-centred destinations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What have the Government done since the report
              was published to address the important issues that the Tourist
              Board identified? The report has addressed the problems; the
              Tourist Board knows what the problems are. However, what action
              plan has been put in place, and how has the plan progressed? There
              was a proposal in the report for an action plan.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Giant’s Causeway is the jewel in the
              crown, not just of North Antrim, but of Northern Ireland, or,
              indeed, these islands, with regard to tourism. It offers an
              exceptional opportunity for attracting tourists, and last year it
              had about 475,000 visitors. After the fire at the Causeway visitor
              centre, the Minister made a very impressive announcement, saying
              that the private sector should get involved, and that a new,
              bigger and better visitor centre should be built. I supported that
              announcement wholeheartedly. Moyle District Council took an
              initiative and produced a development brief. According to that
              brief, the location is now on the market for development as a
              visitor centre. As a result of that initiative, Northern Ireland
              stands on the threshold of a once-in-a- lifetime opportunity to
              get the private sector to build, manage and run a state-of-the-art
              tourism centre. However, the private sector will be guided by the
              wishes of the local council. That is important, to ensure that the
              visitor experience does not simply satisfy the private sector but
              also that the project is guided by the public sector. I welcome
              that initiative.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If and when the site is sold, it will probably
              fetch in excess of £5 million. It is not just a matter of selling
              the site to the highest bidder; the best project must go on that
              site, to enhance not only North Antrim but also Northern Ireland
              plc. Local ratepayers would benefit from such a sale, and the
              Northern Ireland economy would see an advantage in it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To create such jobs in this unemployment black
              spot would be remarkable. It would not only create seasonal
              employment, but long-term, year-round employment for many.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now is the time to move full steam ahead on
              this project. We cannot waste another season waiting for it to
              happen; nor can we slow down, stand back and say that it is
              premature. We have to get on with the job.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1999, the last year for which I have
              figures, 433,745 people visited the Giant’s Causeway. What an
              opportunity this — together with other proposals — provides
              for the development of tourism in Northern Ireland. With the right
              tourism experience in the area, we can draw those people back and,
              furthermore, it is not unrealistic to suggest that we can double
              that figure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is, however, no drive from the public
              sector or the Northern Ireland Tourist Board on those issues. I
              met with them recently, and they took the view that that
              development, and other associated developments, could be
              premature. That viewpoint is unfortunate, as we are already behind
              in development. Anyone putting money up — whether a private
              developer or a person in the public sector — would agree that
              development should be sustainable in the long term.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Minister can assure the House
              that we cannot afford to wait any longer on the development of
              this project and that we must progress expeditiously. Northern
              Ireland must capitalise on its tourism potential.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It causes me some concern that the Northern
              Ireland Tourist Board has a vested interest in the Giant’s
              Causeway. It has quite rightly supported the reinstatement and
              development of a train line from the Causeway to Bushmills. Many
              looked forward with excitement to the development of that train
              service, not only from the point of view of tourists, but also as
              it would offer locals employment. That project has not developed
              in the way that it should have. Years after the project was first
              announced, it has still to leave the railway shed. Where is the
              sustainability of that plan?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recently looked at the Howarth report, which
              examines this issue. It set out the terms and aims of the project
              — to relocate the Shane’s Castle railway to the area and also
              to link two of Northern Ireland’s most famous visitor
              attractions, the Giant’s Causeway and the Bushmills distillery.
              In fact, the project does neither. It links a location close to
              the Giant’s Causeway to one on the outskirts of Bushmills. It
              would be necessary for a person to walk — or stagger, depending
              on where they have come from — back to the train, if the service
              were actually up and running.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sadly, this development proposal has not got
              off the ground. I hope that we can receive the assurance that it
              will get off the ground. However, the reality is that the
              investment required for that project was excessive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When it was first floated in 1994, the proposed
              development costs were £608,000. Initially, with investments and
              the public sector behind it, the proposed costs were approximately
              £1·552 million. Yet, if the project gets up and running, it will
              create only three jobs. That is £500,000 per job. People will
              raise their eyebrows at that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been an awful lot of Government
              investment in this project — £200,000 was given from the
              International Fund for Ireland; £480,000 from the Tourist Board;
              £150,000 from the peace and reconciliation fund; and about
              £150,000 from loans and overdrafts. Despite this, the project is
              still short almost £400,000.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is hardly surprising that, when asked to
              provide the funding deficit needed for the project, the local
              council raised an eyebrow and said that it was &quot;a bit
              rich&quot; for it to have to meet such a shortfall. This project
              risks collapse, and we could have another Navan Fort on our hands.
              I hope that that does not happen.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today I received from the Registry of Companies
              in Northern Ireland the certificate of registration for the
              mortgage relating to the Giant’s Causeway/Bushmills railway. The
              certificate indicates that if the mortgage is not paid when it
              becomes due, which is very soon, the Ulster Bank can seize the
              assets. That would be very good for the bank, but not for those
              involved, those who invested £480,000 of Tourist Board money,
              £200,000 of International Fund for Ireland money or £150,000 of
              peace and reconciliation fund money. This illustrates that the
              proposal was not well thought out. I hope that the Minister can
              indicate that he will take a good look at the proposal, implement
              it, and ensure that the train station is built, because it is
              essential for the locality.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the Department needs to broaden its
              horizons by considering a service from Bushmills to Dunluce Castle
              or Portrush. There should not be merely a 10-minute ride from the
              Giant’s Causeway to the outskirts of Bushmills; there should be
              something more striking to tourists. Tourists will not come simply
              to see the railway station in its present state. However, when
              some of the 400,000 or more visitors come to the Causeway, they
              would use such a facility if it were to give them an experience
              that they could not forget.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I raise these issues because I care about the
              area, and I want tourism in the area to thrive.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I know that the Member is not a
              particular fan of power sharing, but he has used up half of the
              time available. Therefore I ask him to bring his remarks to a
              close. The rest of the time needs to be shared between the
              Minister, who has to respond, and another Member who is keen to
              speak.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was concluding my speech, Mr Speaker, but you
              wrecked my finale — I will have to start again. I appreciate
              that another Member and the Minister wish to speak.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want the clear potential for tourism in the
              area to be fully achieved and the locality to develop as a result.
              The area’s industry needs to be diversified, and tourism offers
              us so many more job opportunities and so much more potential than
              has been offered by other flagging industries that are associated
              with the locality. I commend this issue to the House.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to Mr Paisley Jnr for bringing
              this matter to the House so that we have an opportunity to
              investigate these issues. I am also thankful to the Minister for
              coming along to give us the benefit of his responses.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The potential of North Antrim to attract more
              visitors is undisputed. Giant’s Causeway, the Bushmills
              distillery, the beaches of the north coast, the Glens of Antrim
              and the good selection of golf courses provide plenty of
              attractions for a range of visitors. I share Mr Paisley Jnr’s
              frustration that many visitors seem to stay with us for just a
              short time, often only a day. I trust that the Minister will have
              some ideas on how to extend visitors’ time spent in the area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have concerns, however, about the haphazard
              way in which we seem to be protecting and enhancing these natural
              assets. The planning policy applied along the north coast barely
              merits the term &quot;policy&quot; — it seems to consist of a
              series of ad hoc decisions. This serial &quot;ad hocery&quot; is
              leading to a degradation of that natural beauty. It is vital that
              we pull together a much more carefully thought out, long-term
              strategic approach that will protect the natural beauty of the
              coastline.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is perfectly possible to do that while
              addressing issues such as the need for more accommodation. I place
              that comment in the context of the need for rural diversification,
              particularly the need for farmers to find activities other than
              working the land, which I think will become a more marginal
              activity, especially in north Antrim, where the climate presents
              problems not necessarily experienced elsewhere.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need not have any fears for our dairy
              industry on good land, but there are difficulties with some of the
              more marginal land. I have bombarded the Minister with letters on
              that subject and related subjects, and the Minister of the
              Environment has also heard from me quite frequently on these
              matters. All of my letters say the same thing essentially: there
              is a need for a holistic approach.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the future of farming, we have to
              ask ourselves what assets farmers have and how best they can
              exploit them. They often have buildings in addition to land. In
              the Lake District — and quite widely in rural England where
              planning policies are very tight, particularly with regard to new
              building in open country — there is a great premium attached to
              the conversion of existing farm buildings. Stone buildings can
              easily be converted and extended in the same style as existing
              buildings in order to provide very attractive rural accommodation.
              However, this is more expensive than the cost of straightforward
              new build, and we have to acknowledge that in any policy we
              develop. We have to enable such activity to command a premium that
              repays the extra costs involved. It is possible to create and
              preserve such a premium provided there are restrictive policies in
              other respects, and we should go down that route.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am always concerned when I see farmers
              selling a plot to raise some cash, which they use invariably to
              address their own short-term deficits. In effect, they have simply
              turned capital into income, and I would very much prefer if they
              were encouraged and incentivised to look at providing themselves
              with an alternative income stream, perhaps through the provision
              of various types of holiday accommodation. There are a number of
              ways in which Government, working on a cross-departmental basis
              with a holistic approach, could encourage that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also hope that when the Minister and his
              Colleagues are looking at the overall strategic development of
              this area they will bend their minds to how they will handle the
              traffic flow if the Minister of Enterprise is successful in
              increasing the numbers of tourists. I am sure that Mr Paisley
              would agree with me that significant potential exists. The numbers
              of people visiting the Causeway Coast each year could be increased
              significantly, and we could encourage more of them to spend more
              time along the coastline and to visit the other features.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we are dealing with a narrow road,
              which runs along the coast, and there can be a particularly severe
              bottleneck at Bushmills. We should be thinking about how we might
              better manage that stream of traffic in the long term. I share Mr
              Paisley’s frustration regarding the position of the tram
              terminus. It would be so much better to drive, or take the bus, to
              the top of the town of Bushmills, visit the distillery, and then
              mount the tram and ride to the Giant’s Causeway. The return
              journey could be taken at leisure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That would have the significant extra benefit
              of taking some traffic off the road between Bushmills and the
              Causeway. By not having located that facility at the top of the
              town — and there would undoubtedly be some difficulties in
              locating it there — you must therefore look at what can be done
              to enhance the potential for using the terminus at the foot of
              Bushmills. It could still perhaps be used as a preferred means of
              transporting people to the Causeway to reduce the strain on the
              narrow and restricted roads system that exists between those two
              locations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should consider the Glens of Antrim,
              particularly in the aftermath of foot-and-mouth disease. It would
              be wise to consult with people in the Lake District, where they
              have been far more successful hitherto than we have in encouraging
              people to use the walking facilities there. We do not have
              anything like the same number of rights of way and bridleways,
              although a substantial section of the Ulster Way goes through part
              of the Glens.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have not addressed ourselves to the problem
              that while it is nice to walk 10 miles down the path, the trouble
              is that you must then walk 10 miles back. Other places have
              managed to address this problem quite well by having a shuttle bus
              service that will collect you from your destination and leave you
              back to where you parked your car. In New Zealand, a country I
              admire for the way in which it has achieved rural diversification,
              walkers’ huts are provided where full overnight accommodation
              facilities are available for a fee. This encourages people to take
              long walks because they do not have to carry as many items with
              them as they would do if they were expecting to pitch a tent and
              carry their own gas cylinders.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to delve too deeply into this,
              but these points illustrate some imaginative ideas that we could
              adopt to make better use of our resources. While hikers are not
              necessarily the biggest-spending visitors, it is surprising
              nonetheless how much some of them can spend along the way,
              especially if the right facilities are available to encourage them
              to dip into their wallets.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having put some ideas further to those
              mentioned by Mr Paisley Jnr to the Minister, I conclude. I trust
              that the Minister and others will look at a wide variety of
              matters that must be addressed to produce a successful long-term
              strategy to enhance the tourist potential of North Antrim.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and
              Investment (Sir Reg Empey):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am indebted to the Members for their
              contributions. Several ideas have been floated by both Members who
              spoke. Officials will note those ideas. I do not intend to respond
              to every matter, but both Members have made some good suggestions,
              and these will be taken up.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to first deal with the broad-brush
              approach. North Antrim contains some of the most dramatic and
              sensitive environments in Northern Ireland. Not surprisingly, the
              area is one of our most popular visitor destinations because of
              the world heritage site of the Giant’s Causeway. Given that
              visitors to the area not only benefit the local economy but also
              make an important contribution to the wider economy of Northern
              Ireland, it is essential that we take a long-term view of how the
              area is managed. We must ensure that the natural beauty is
              protected not only for its own sake but to ensure that future
              generations will benefit and that we will pass on to them an asset
              that we currently value and enjoy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the process we will help people and
              businesses to continue to derive economic benefit from visitors.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development of the tourism industry in
              North Antrim, as elsewhere throughout Northern Ireland, has
              unfortunately been hindered in the past, largely as a result of
              the political unrest. It is not something that we should hide
              behind or ignore. We are confronted with it at the moment, and
              Members will know that the US Department of State recently issued
              a warning to its citizens. We have a very debilitating CNN
              international image at this time of year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must put this in the context of investment
              decisions, not simply by the public sector but by the private
              sector. We are attempting to improve our infrastructure, because
              we understand that there are gaps and weaknesses. It is a
              chicken-and-egg situation: we need the private sector to come
              forward with proposals and bankers and other institutions to offer
              investment resources so that we can assess them and decide whether
              we can assist them or not. In many cases people find great
              difficulty in persuading commercial banks and others to back
              people in that way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We saw an upsurge in tourism in 1995, and Mr
              Paisley was using that as a baseline for many of the comparators,
              but people who then stepped forward and invested on the back of
              that soon discovered that their optimism was ill-founded. It is
              that legacy that we are dealing with. It is a huge problem for the
              tourism sector.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must look to the long term and build up our
              expectations and infrastructure. We also have to build up the
              training and capability of those who are going to work in the
              tourism sector. It can no longer be regarded as a Cinderella
              industry, something that you do if you cannot do anything else. We
              must get past that. I have had discussions with my Colleague, the
              Minister for Higher and Further Education, Training and
              Employment, and he also feels strongly about this issue. We are
              taking initiatives to try to ensure that the industry has a supply
              of people with the skills particular to this industry. Tourism is
              no longer something you work at if you cannot do anything else.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must raise the standards, because people can
              go anywhere in the world today. They do not have to come here;
              they can get on a plane and go virtually anywhere in a few hours.
              We have to develop and play to our strengths, and our strengths
              are not two weeks in the sun. Our strengths are natural
              resource-based tourism and the natural beauty of the Province.
              They include the hospitality and the welcome that people receive;
              our heritage; our ability to develop golf and fishing; the natural
              resources of our gardens and large historic homes; hunting;
              shooting; and other activities. We have many strengths, and we
              must play to those strengths.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are more players in this than the Tourist
              Board and my Department. Local authorities and regional tourism
              organisations, partly funded by the Northern Ireland Tourist
              Board, also have a role to play. They bring together a partnership
              of local authorities — the industry itself with the Tourist
              Board resources put in. However, ultimately, it also requires a
              degree of self-help.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Causeway Coast and Glens area account for
              approximately 30% of the visitors who come to Northern Ireland,
              and that area has vast potential. It is also a huge slice of the
              cake and market share.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the other Members that there is
              potential for that to grow even further, and not only in numbers,
              as numbers alone do not necessarily produce the revenue. There
              must be an increase in the value of the product.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that we have been losing out on day
              trips. Day trips are fine, but we know that many coach tours from
              the Republic call in and return home and spend the night in County
              Donegal or somewhere else. The currency differential makes some of
              our products uncompetitive; the Tourist Board has tried to
              overcome that, as has the industry, by doing pound-for-punt
              promotions. However, some coach operators have told me that they
              must wait until things settle down before they can sign up.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a need — and this comes under the
              regional development strategy with which Mr Paisley Jnr began his
              remarks — for destination facilities. I fully accept that. I
              recently met a developer who is proposing a very ambitious scheme
              in the area. The Member will know to whom I refer. That is the
              sort of product on which we must concentrate, because it is
              sympathetic to the area and, if developed properly, will not
              impinge unduly on the environment. It has the potential, if things
              work out, to be environmentally and financially sustainable. All
              these things, however, must be dealt with case by case. That sort
              of product can add value to an area without damaging its natural
              beauty and resources.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We come back time and time again to planning
              issues, and they are not dissimilar to those that we face in
              industrial development. I get the impression that our planning
              approach is more energetic than that of our competitors in the
              Republic, who seem to be able to get a more sympathetic hearing
              for their industries.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That leads me neatly to Members’ reference to
              Invest Northern Ireland and the Industrial Development Bill. We
              treat tourism as an industry and as a business. That is why we
              propose transferring the grant-aiding ability of the Tourist Board
              to Invest Northern Ireland so that any business, tourism or any
              other kind of industry, can go to where one set of skills is
              located. We hope that this will offer an enhanced service to the
              industry. It was the unanimous view of the board, and of the
              industry, that this step be taken. We are acting quickly to ensure
              that it is in place as early as possible next year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been many funding interventions in
              the area over the years from the Tourist Board and European
              programmes. They have contributed significantly and will continue
              to do so. The same applies to International Fund for Ireland
              assistance. As for the joined-up approach, my Colleagues in the
              Departments of Agriculture and Rural Development and Culture, Arts
              and Leisure have a significant role to play. I have communicated
              regularly with them on various issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motor sports proposal was mentioned, and
              that is a matter for Mr McGimpsey. In view of recent unfortunate
              casualties, a purpose-built facility with built-in safety measures
              may be an attractive proposition.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members talked about the Bushmills railway, for
              which a special trust has been established. We do not own it. The
              Tourist Board is in a grant-aiding role in this instance. The
              project is at a very advanced stage, and we have allocated money
              to it, as have others. As with so many major infrastructure
              projects, the cost tends to run away from us. I have noted what
              both Members have said on this matter, and the Tourist Board will
              reflect on those points to see if there is any advice we can offer
              the trust that hopes to bring this project to fruition. Clearly
              there is some way to go yet on the financing of it, albeit
              substantial sums of money have been earmarked.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the matter of getting the Glens
              back in business. There is no doubt that that area has suffered
              badly. The Member who brought this debate forward put it forward
              at the height of the foot-and-mouth disease crisis, and he knows
              that my Department is currently administering the compensation
              facility to assist people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We made special measures in the terms of
              reference to take account of the small-business people who may not
              be paying a business rate but yet have suffered. We decided that
              the way around that was to look at the domestic rate position of
              those people and to try to ensure that, if they were registered
              with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, they would be included in
              the scheme even if they were not paying a business rate. Many of
              them have experienced not simply a drop in business but an
              elimination of their business. That is extremely difficult for
              them to cope with, particularly at a time of year when the cash
              flow is at the minimum and they are perhaps investing in repairs
              and maintenance. The timing of events could not have been worse.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the North West 200, the Member
              knows that I fought the battle on that as best I could. I fully
              realised the extent to which the business in the area would suffer
              if it were cancelled. Unfortunately it was not possible to prevail
              over the advice from the veterinary experts, and we had to bow to
              the inevitable. However, we did our best to assist the local
              authority in the north-west when it came forward with a project to
              try to replace some of the business, and we were very happy to
              support that project.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am acutely aware of the unemployment
              situation in the Moyle area, and I have visited the area on a
              number of occasions. One of the things that we are currently
              looking at — and Members will know this — is the ferry
              project. I am pleased to report that we are at a very advanced
              stage with the market testing of that. There does appear to be
              interest. The Scotland Office is looking at things at the present
              time, and we hope to be able to get some steer in the next few
              weeks as to whether we can attract operators at a rate of
              assistance that we believe to be reasonable. If we get through
              that stage, much will then depend on how we split the thing
              between the Scottish side and the Northern Ireland side. That, of
              course, is a separate issue that we would have to deal with as we
              go forward, but it is very important.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the question of the visitor experience, I
              agree entirely that the satisfaction rating is good but could be a
              lot better — I fully accept that. That depends on a mixture of
              training and of ensuring that the people who invest believe that
              they have got a potentially profitable investment. That brings me
              back again to the chicken-and- egg situation I referred to with
              the question of political stability, and so on. If we did not have
              that problem, we would be much further advanced in developing an
              industry which would compare very well with the Lake District or
              anywhere else.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe, particularly with regard to the
              North Antrim area, that the assets and the potential are there. I
              have no doubt about that, and I have supported the concept of what
              I call &quot;a string of pearls&quot; — looking forward from the
              Campbeltown side right over into North Antrim and across into
              Limavady, and even into County Donegal with the various projects
              that are planned there. You could see how under the right
              circumstances you would have a very attractive product for the
              entire north-eastern area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The north-east and surrounding areas spread
              beyond the parliamentary constituency. Nevertheless, the regional
              tourism organisation in that area is very active in developing its
              own strategy. Our role, of course, is not confined to developing
              strategy for the local area. That is the job of the local
              authorities in conjunction with the industry through the regional
              training organisation. We support them, but that has to be in the
              wider context of the strategy for Northern Ireland as a whole. It
              is beginning to clarify itself.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we move forward, we begin to identify the
              type of product that we can develop. Enormous potential rests
              there. The potential to expand the tourist industry is greater
              than that in any other industry in Northern Ireland. The industry
              is operating at about one third of its capacity. I cannot think of
              any other industry where the potential for growth, job creation
              and wealth creation is greater.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a great deal at stake. We will have to
              work closely with the tourist industry. We will have to work to
              stabilise the political situation because that is one of the major
              problems. There is also the continuous currency difficulty to deal
              with. There is no doubt that continental holidays have become much
              more attractive or that Northern Ireland is up against stiff
              competition from the Republic of Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure Members that the points that they have
              made in the debate will be considered by the Tourist Board. If
              Members feel that any points require attention by letter, I will
              be pleased to follow those up in due course.</p>
