<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Capital Review</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The first item on the agenda was to be a statement from the Minister of  Education. The Minister is not here and that business will fall.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="b"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill: First Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: I beg to introduce the Clean Neighbourhoods and  Environment Bill (NIA 31/09), which is a Bill to make provision for the gating  of certain minor roads; to make provision in relation to vehicles parked on  roads that are exposed for sale or being repaired; to make provision in  relation to abandoned vehicles and the removal and disposal of vehicles; to  make provision in relation to litter and graffiti, fly-posting and the display  of advertisements; to make provision relating to the control of dogs; to make  provision in relation to noise; to restate the law on statutory nuisances and  improve the summary procedures for dealing with them; to increase the maximum  penalty in relation to certain pollution offences; and for connected purposes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Bill passed First Stage and ordered to be printed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Bill will be put on the list of future business until a date for its Second  Stage is determined.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="c"></a>Housing Amendment (No. 2) Bill: First Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development &nbsp;(Mr Attwood)</strong>: I  beg to introduce the Housing Amendment (No. 2) Bill (NIA 32/09), which is a  Bill to amend the law relating to housing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Bill passed First Stage and ordered to be printed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Bill will be put on the list of future business until a date for its Second  Stage is determined.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="d"></a>Welfare Reform Bill: Further Consideration Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call on the Minister for Social Development to move the Further Consideration  Stage of the Welfare Reform Bill.</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-Moved">Moved. &mdash; [The Minister for Social Development &nbsp;(Mr Attwood).]</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  As no amendments have been selected, there is no opportunity to discuss the  Welfare Reform Bill today. Members will, of course, be able to have a full  debate at Final Stage. Further Consideration Stage is, therefore, concluded.  The Bill stands referred to the Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Because of the non-appearance of the Minister of Education,  business has moved forward much more quickly than expected. I, therefore, ask  the House to take its ease before we move to the Second Stage of the  Safeguarding Board Bill.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="e"></a>Assembly Business</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr Storey)</strong>: On a point of order, Mr  Speaker. Will you advise the House on the status of the statement that the  Education Minister was due to make this morning? As Chairperson of the  Education Committee, I received a copy of the statement just two minutes before  coming into the Chamber. However, no copies were available for other Members,  which is totally unacceptable. Given that the Minister is unable to be here for  whatever reason, will you rule on the status of her statement and explain what  action you plan to take in respect of her handling of the situation?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I thank the Member for his point of order. First, the statement has not been  delivered to the House. Secondly, Standing Orders are absolutely clear: a  Minister must, as far as possible, provide Members with his or her statement at  least 30 minutes before he or she is due to deliver it in the House. If that is  not possible, the Minister concerned must explain the reason to the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Minister may wish to make the statement  to the House in future, and those are questions that the Member and other  Members may wish to ask her. Certainly, the Minister owes the House an  explanation as to why she was absent this morning and could not, therefore,  make her statement and why Members did not receive the statement 30 minutes  before it was due to be made. As we know, the statement has not been made.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="f"></a>Executive Committee Business<span style="font-family:'ITC Franklin Gothic Demi'; font-size:12.0pt; "> </span></p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Safeguarding Board Bill: Second Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Safeguarding Board Bill [NIA  25/09] be agreed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The importance of safeguarding children and young people in  our society has long been recognised by government and is a matter that I and  my Executive colleagues take extremely seriously. We are all only too well  aware of the high-profile cases and inquiries that have demonstrated the need  for system improvements, not least to the way in which agencies and  organisations work together to safeguard children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Historically, social services and the PSNI have been viewed  as the lead agencies that intervene to protect children who are at risk. It is  for those agencies to continue to do so &mdash; the establishment of the Safeguarding  Board for Northern Ireland (SBNI) is not needed to dilute those services.  However, I emphasise that safeguarding children is everyone&rsquo;s business: Ministers;  Departments; local government; the statutory, voluntary and community sectors;  and the public all have an important role to play. It is essential that all  agencies and organisations, and all who provide services on their behalf, are  clear about their responsibilities towards children. There is a need to ensure  that collective responsibilities are reflected in our systems and structures  and that safeguarding children and promoting their welfare remains high on  everyone&rsquo;s agenda.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The current arrangements for a regional child protection  committee supported by the five health and social care trust child protection panels  were established as administrative arrange&shy;ments only. In the past, under the  legacy boards, area child protection committees and panels were criticised for  lacking focus and strategic perspective. Therefore, it is fundamental that we  put in place the very best structures to facilitate interdepartmental,  inter-professional and inter-agency co-operation, with an emphasis on  prevention and keeping children safe.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As an Assembly and an Executive, we need to be mature about  the difficult choices that we face. How we invest in and protect our children  speaks volumes about the type of government and community we are and hope to be  in the future. I firmly believe that the Bill to establish a new statutory  Safeguarding Board is a significant milestone for Northern Ireland. The Safeguarding  Board will embody the truly joined-up approach that is needed to tackle all  factors that have an impact on children&rsquo;s safety and welfare.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, many agencies work with families who are very often  overwhelmed by economic circum&shy;stances, physical health problems, mental health  problems, dependence on alcohol or other substances, experiences of domestic or  sexual violence, or, perhaps, by the complex and difficult task of being a  parent in today&rsquo;s society. More than 21,000 children in Northern Ireland  are referred to social services every year. At any time, approximately 2,500  children are in care and more than 2,000 children are on the child protection  register. Those statistics tell only part of the story of the number of  families and children who need help and of the help that they are getting. In Northern Ireland,  40,000 children live in families in which there are substance abuse problems.  At least 11,000 children live with domestic violence on a daily basis and,  every year, more than 1,000 children are added to the child protection  register.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we invest in the future fabric of our  society so that fewer families reach crisis point and fewer children suffer  harm. The Bill supports the wider safeguarding agenda, which includes  prevention and early intervention. It is also about acknowledging and  understanding that protecting children is very often about helping to address  the needs and problems of vulnerable adults and many parents whose ability to  care for their children has been compromised.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If we are serious about prevention and early intervention  to protect children and to deliver wider benefits to society, we have to  prioritise services in that area. That is why I have invested in that area and  strengthened front line child protection services by establishing gateway teams  in every trust in Northern    Ireland. That includes addressing broader  structural issues about how agencies and organisations that deal with housing,  education, social care and criminal justice as well as issues such as mental  health, substance abuse, domestic violence, sexual violence and neglect, work  together strategically to improve outcomes for children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, I want to stress that the establishment of the  Safeguarding Board is not a rebranding exercise; it is a tangible commitment  from us to be there for children and to put them at the heart of everything  that we do. The creation of the Safeguarding Board is a critical step in  strengthening our current arrangements for inter-agency co-operation on  protecting children. That will ensure co-operation on safeguarding arrangements  at the highest level within Departments, local government and the statutory,  voluntary and community sectors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, the creation of a new organisation will not, in  itself, change things. A fundamental shift in thinking is needed to make sure  that all children receive the services that they need as those needs arise. The  establishment of the Safeguarding Board will bring that required change of  thinking, practice and culture, and ensure that agencies that work with  children and families discharge more effectively their responsibilities to  safeguard and promote the welfare of children and to work together to improve  outcomes for children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been a full public consultation, which  overwhelmingly endorsed the policy proposals and informed the Bill. My  Department has also undertaken further engagement with key stakeholders, which  has been of great help in refining the detail of the Bill. A broader  stakeholder reference group has also been established and includes statutory  organisations and a greater number of NGOs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Safeguarding Board Bill will provide the necessary  legislative framework for the creation of the new regional Safeguarding Board  for Northern Ireland  to be sited within, and supported by, the Public Health Agency. The objective  of the Safeguarding Board for Northern    Ireland will be to co-ordinate and ensure  the effectiveness of what each person or body represented on the board does for  the purposes of safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will highlight some of the key elements of this important  piece of legislation. Clause 3 sets out the functions that the Safeguarding  Board must undertake, which include developing policies and procedures to  safeguard and promote the welfare of children in Northern Ireland; promoting an  awareness of the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children; keeping  under review the adequacy and effectiveness of what members do to safeguard and  promote the welfare of children; undertaking case management reviews in such  circumstances as may be prescribed; reviewing such information, as may be  prescribed, in relation to the deaths of children that are normally resident in  Northern Ireland; advising the Health and Social Care Board and local commissioning  groups on safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children; taking reasonable  steps to promote communication between the Safeguarding Board and children and  young people; and making arrangements for consultation and discussion on the  safeguarding and promotion of the welfare of children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 7 places a duty on the Safeguarding Board to  establish three specific types of Committee. First, a safeguarding panel will  be located in each health and social care trust&rsquo;s geographical area. The  safeguarding panels will play a vital part in providing the necessary support  for the Safeguarding Board. The role of the safeguarding panels will primarily  be co-ordinating and operational in nature. Their membership will come from a  wide range of interests, disciplines, agencies and providers of children&rsquo;s  services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, in respect of case management review panels, we  are proposing that SBNI assumes responsibility for case management reviews when  a child has been seriously harmed or has died, and abuse is a known or  suspected factor.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, the child death overview panel will take forward  two interrelated child death review processes. The first will consider  information on regional patterns and trends relating to all child deaths. The  second will identify learning from sudden or unexpected child deaths. That will  strengthen child death review arrangements in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 10 places a general duty of co-operation on the  Safeguarding Board and its member agencies, and vice versa. The need for co-operation  makes perfect sense, and it is only right that those working together to  safeguard children do not work in silos as though their responsibility comes to  an end at professional and organisational boundaries. If the child is truly at  the centre of the system, agencies and individuals must work together and  communicate seamlessly across interdisciplinary boundaries.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 11 seeks to place a duty on bodies to supply  information requested by the Safeguarding Board, and sets out the specific  conditions to be satisfied before requests for information can be met. Sharing  information with the right people at the right time is the only way in which a  complete picture of a child&rsquo;s circumstances can be constructed. It also helps  professionals across the whole range of services to see the complete picture,  and not to allow children at risk of harm to remain invisible to those who can  help them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 12 introduces a new duty and interrelated functions  designed to protect and safeguard children. It is proposed to introduce a duty  on relevant statutory agencies and bodies to make arrangements to ensure that,  in discharging their statutory functions, they have due regard to the need to  safeguard and promote the welfare of children in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am convinced that the measures proposed in the  Safeguarding Board Bill represent a very important step forward in setting up  necessary links and tightening the knots in the vital safety net for  safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr Wells)</strong>:  On behalf of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, I  welcome the Bill and its intentions to strengthen safeguarding arrangements in Northern Ireland.  It will do that by placing a fundamentally important part of child protection  and its workings on a statutory footing. The Committee is delighted to see that  the Bill will create a Safeguarding Board &mdash; SBNI &mdash; on which the Committee is  extremely keen. The protection of children is everyone&rsquo;s business, and we  congratulate the Minister on getting the Bill into the legislative programme  and before the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is an incredibly timely issue. Not a week goes by  without some dreadful headline in the newspapers about young children being  exposed to all types of physical and sexual abuse. Therefore, the Bill could  not come at a more opportune time as far as those involved in child protection  are concerned. The Committee has spent considerable time doing pre-legislative  scrutiny of SBNI, and knows exactly what it wants the Safeguarding Board to do.  The Committee has clear views on the approach that the Department should take.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At Committee Stage, we will examine how closely the Bill  delivers what we feel is desirable. After a cursory examination, however, the  Committee may have issues, particularly around the concept of independence, as  proposed in Lord Laming&rsquo;s work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Committee, therefore, I will outline the  key principles that we want the Bill to address. The Committee is in complete  agreement with the underlying principle of the Bill, which is to provide a  legislative framework to establish a Safeguarding Board for Northern Ireland.  The Safeguarding Board&rsquo;s purpose will be to co-ordinate and ensure the  effectiveness of all organisations that are involved with and promote the  welfare of children. I do not think that a single Member of the House could not  say &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo; and sign up 100% to those objectives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Safeguarding Board will replace a number of structures  known as area child protection committees. Although well meaning in their own  right, it appears that those committees have no real teeth or focus. Their lack  of legislative basis means that they sometimes struggle to move forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During pre-legislative scrutiny, we consulted with groups  that are working on child protection, and we took oral evidence from the  voluntary and statutory agencies that would be involved in the operation of the  board. We also heard from two witnesses who are experts in the English system.  We intended to travel to Bolton and Bradford  to study at first hand the operation of safeguarding boards in GB, but,  unfortunately, we were one of the first victims of the volcanic ash cloud, and  we did not get a chance to go on the day in question. That was unfortunate, but  it was just one of those things.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 22 April 2010, the Committee was briefed by departmental  officials, and it saw the draft Bill for the first time. As I said earlier,  although the Committee supports the principles of the Bill, it has identified a  number of issues that it believes are vital for its effective operation.  Perhaps the single most important issue for the Committee is the independence  of SBNI. By that, we mean that SBNI must be able to be a critical friend. It  should be able to tell the Department and other bodies where they are going  wrong. The Committee&rsquo;s initial and very preliminary discussions of the draft  Bill in April show that it appears that the Committee doubts that the Bill will  allow that to happen to the extent that it would have liked.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will outline one element that worries the Committee.  Evidence that was taken from stakeholders working in child protection and those  who are experienced in the safeguarding boards in England indicated that it is  essential that the board be independent. However, according to clause 3, the  Department&rsquo;s approval is required before the board can publish any materials or  documents. The Committee&rsquo;s first glance at that clause made it believe that the  board&rsquo;s independence and its ability to be that critical friend could be  restricted. Some Committee members are concerned that that represents a veto.  Whether that is real or perceived, the Committee feels that that provision  could fetter the board and hinder it in its role.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall speak now on a personal level, rather than as a  Committee Chairperson. The overall feel of the Bill is that the Department lies  somehow outside the arrangements of the Bill, except in its oversight capacity  and its ability to have a veto on many areas. However, we know that if SBNI is  to work and be successful, the Department needs to be an equal partner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another crucial factor for the board&rsquo;s success is the size  and seniority of its membership. When we took evidence from the NSPCC on 25  February 2010, it pointed out that the board must be large enough to represent  the various agencies and disciplines that work in the field of child  protection, but that it must be small enough to be manageable. It is also vital  that those sitting on the board are at such a level that they can make  decisions on behalf of their organisations and commit those bodies to their  decisions. We were told in the strategic policy document that the Department  produced, which the Committee felt was an excellent piece of work, that most  organisations would be represented on the board by their chief executives or by  very senior representatives. That person would generally have delegated  authority. We examined the issue in great detail and considered whether that  level of seniority is correct. However, given that the Bill does not prescribe  the detail of the level of representation, it will be dealt with in subordinate  legislation. The Bill allows for that through the route of negative resolution,  and the Committee will examine whether it is appropriate. The Committee&rsquo;s  initial view is that it prefers the route of affirmative resolution for the  subordinate legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee will examine in detail who should sit on the  board, and it will consider the lack of input from the judiciary. The Committee  considers that to be seriously lacking. Whenever children attend court, the  application of the law is a serious and essential part of child protection.  Although there was perhaps consensus in the Committee that members of the  judiciary need not sit on the board, members felt that they would like to see  some linkage to the Children Order Advisory Committee. The Committee will,  therefore, explore in detail with the Department how that linkage should be  made. Such a discussion will ensure that the matter is placed on public record.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is also concerned about the lack of medical  representation on the board. Often the first people to become aware of physical  abuse are the nurses and doctors in A&amp;E. We want to see people with some  links to that expertise on SBNI.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also important that we focus clearly on core issues  and learn the lessons of the experiences in England, where safeguarding boards  have been in place for four years. It is useful that, in this instance, we have  the experience of the situation in England  and Wales  over those four years to learn from. We can learn from any mistakes that were  made and benefit from any successes. We hope that, as a result of that, our  legislation would be of an even higher standard than that for the rest of the UK. That is why  the Committee is keen to learn from those who have had a reasonable period of  involvement in this very important issue.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that board members understand from the  start what is expected of them in their role and what their responsibilities  are. That fact came out strongly in Professor Alan France&rsquo;s evaluation of the  English boards. A scattergun approach or too wide a remit can lead to the  dilution of results. The Committee agrees with the assessment that the most  successful English boards are focused and realistic. There is a fine line  between the role and remit being inspirational and being achievable. We will  examine the remit of the board in some depth, but we are initially pleased to  see that its objectives must be set by affirmative resolution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee took evidence from Professor Jan Horwath of  the University of   Sheffield on 4 March  2010. She was able to share her experience of working with child protection  committees in England and Wales, and she  emphasised the importance of an independent chairperson. The crucial role that  the chairperson will hold will be a recurring theme during the Committee Stage.  Witnesses, including representatives from Children in Northern Ireland  (CiNI), also made the point, with which the Committee agrees, that the right  person is essential for the post and that that person must be independent. The  Bill will allow that the appointment process be done by regulation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The appointment of the right chairperson to the board will  be a crucial task in the process. One has only to look at the criteria required  to see that he or she will have to be an extremely highly motivated and capable  individual. When we get to that stage, the Committee will be interested to see  how the Department goes about that appointment; we cannot overemphasise how  important that role is. The Committee will examine that clause in detail and  may need to be convinced that the regulations should continue to be subject to  negative resolution. We will watch developments with interest.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is aware of issues surrounding case  management reviews and child death reviews. There have been questions about who  has been responsible for what. The Committee looks forward to discussing that  with departmental officials and will go into detail at Committee Stage. We are  delighted to see that those functions are identified as being core to the board  and are in full agreement with that, but we note that the detail will be in the  subordinate legislation. It is also important that there are clear links with  the Coroners Service, the police and the Court Service. There will be keen  discussion with officials on that aspect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The establishment of subcommittees and local panels is  outlined in clauses 7 and 8. Those groups have been identified as a critical  factor in the success of boards in GB, and I am sure that that will be the case  here. They will be the engine room of the proposed SBNI &mdash; its driving force.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many groups who spoke to the Committee, including Children  in Northern Ireland,  stressed the need for a duty to co-operate with the Safeguarding Board.  Therefore, we were pleased to see that duty made statutory in clause 10.  However, we note that it applies only to organisations named in the Bill, and  we wonder whether it should be applied more widely. I am sure that the Minister  will examine that and let us know why he has been so specific in outlining  named organisations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, we are delighted that the Executive has decided to  proceed with the Bill, and we look forward to getting into its detail during  Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I apologise for being late and missing  some of the Minister&rsquo;s introductory remarks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted that the Bill has reached this stage. As the  Chairperson of the Health Committee stated, safeguarding is everyone&rsquo;s  business. Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the Bill&rsquo;s broad principles and its intention to  ensure that we have strengthened safeguarding arrangements that will protect  the most vulnerable children. We will have measures designed to improve  interagency co-operation on child protection at the highest level in  Departments and bodies throughout the health and social care system, and I will  explore that further in my contribution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister said, the Bill will ensure a legislative  framework for the creation of a new Safeguarding Board that will have five  safeguarding panels, one in each of the health and social care trusts. It is  also important to point out that safeguarding is a relatively new term, which  is broader than child protection as it includes prevention. The Committee  learned of that early in its prelegislative consultation with various groups.  As the Committee Chairperson said, many groups provided the Committee with  their expertise in child protection. We also spoke to the Department to tease  out issues about which we had concerns or queries.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is an important piece of legislation, and we want  to ensure that we take the time needed to call on all the experts to examine  best practice as we move through Committee Stage. Given the evidence that we  heard, some issues still need to be clarified and strengthened in the proposed  legislation, and I will address them in turn.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first is the duty to co-operate, which, Sinn F&eacute;in is  concerned, is not clearly defined. We welcome the duty to co-operate being  included in the legislation but are not sure how it would work in practice and  how any sanctions would be applied when bodies do not co-operate. I am still  uncertain about who would hold such bodies to account. Sadly, we are all aware  of high-profile cases such as that of the McGovern/McElhill family, which was  discussed in the House recently. At that stage, it was clear to all that,  although the agencies worked well independently, the failure occurred in  working collectively. My party colleague Claire McGill will pick up on that  point later in the debate, so I will not elaborate. However, perhaps the  Minister will say more about how he sees the duty to co-operate and  accountability working.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That leads me to the issue of who will ultimately be  accountable for the work of the Safeguarding Board. Will it be the so-called  independent chairperson; the chief executive of the Public Health Agency, where  the board will be sited; or, indeed, the Minister? We must be clear from the start  that there should be no grey areas, and we need to have clear lines of  accountability.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Chairperson said, the seniority of those who will  sit on the Safeguarding Board needs to be clarified. The Department said that  people at chief executive level will be involved in the board and that it does  not expect those chief executives to be able to delegate that responsibility.  However, we need to establish a balance. Although we need buy-in to the  safeguarding boards at senior level, we must also involve operational  experience from those whose invaluable skills will be needed at the table.  Nevertheless, I understand that we need the people at that table to have the  power to take decisions and implement them in their organisations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also examined what it expected to become the  core work of a Safeguarding Board and its panels and whether that work should  be more focused or wide-ranging. England&rsquo;s experience over the past  four years dictates that the wider the scope or agenda of the board, the less  focused it is on core child protection and prevention issues. On their  inception in England,  safeguarding boards tended to take on a wider agenda; however, experience there  has dictated that we need to establish a better balance. We should learn from that  experience by including the core issues around prevention of harm for all  children, focusing attention on all those considered vulnerable and  establishing a protective and rehabilitative response to those who have been  harmed. That is another point that the Minister may pick up on when he  describes how he envisages the scope of safeguarding boards.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are broad comments on the generality of the Bill. My  colleagues will elaborate on specific points. We look forward to the Bill&rsquo;s  Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Child protection, as Members have said, is an emotive and crucially important  issue for Northern Ireland,  as the manner in which our society protects its most vulnerable is a measure of  its development. The horrors of child cruelty in cases such as Baby P in England have made it apparent that we need  constantly to review and monitor how we approach child protection in the UK. Therefore,  I congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill to its Second Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Safeguarding Board Bill is another part of a  comprehensive programme of reforming Northern Ireland&rsquo;s child protection  services. The Bill is substantial and illustrates again the Minister&rsquo;s ability  to reform health and social services here. At its crux, the Bill aims to ensure  the best child protection in Northern    Ireland by ensuring the consistency,  efficiency and effectiveness of provision throughout the Province.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Historically, each of the former health and social services  boards operated an area child protection committee on a non-statutory basis.  Those committees distributed the findings of case management reviews, raised  awareness of child protection issues and promoted compliance with child  protection procedures. Although it is recognised that the committees did  excellent work, the experience of their operation identified areas in which  performance could be improved and a need for greater consistency in how the  various area-based child protection committees approached their task and the  composition of the committees.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A key reason why the system needs to be changed is that the  provisions are not statutory. The new arrangements will give the boards  statutory functions to better ensure compliance and a duty to co-operate. The  Bill will provide the legislative framework for the creation of a new regional  Safeguarding Board for Northern    Ireland, hosted within the Public Health  Agency, with a safeguarding panel in each of the five health and social care  trust areas. That arrangement will, for the first time, bring together on a  statutory basis the key agencies from voluntary and statutory sectors to  safeguard children and promote their welfare.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The board will fit in well with the Public Health Agency,  because it will be tasked with promoting awareness of the need to safeguard the  welfare of children. It will keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness  of its member agencies, and it will undertake improvements to safeguarding  practices. The Bill will make it a statutory duty for organisations to provide  information to the Safeguarding Board, thus further ensuring improved outcomes.  Finally, the Bill will ensure that the Minister will report to the Assembly at  least once a year on the board&rsquo;s progress. It will improve accountability and  ensure that this region has the highest standards of child protection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will give independence and added accountability to  child protection issues in Northern    Ireland, and that should be welcomed  strongly by all sides of the House. Protecting the most vulnerable children is  a serious responsibility for the Minister, the Assembly and society in general.  Therefore, I welcome the Bill. I look forward to scrutinising it in Committee,  and, given the evidence that we have received so far, I join others in  stressing how critical it will be to get the panels and their leadership right.  Focusing on the right issues will also be critical. As the Bill moves through  Committee Stage, I look forward to working with departmental officials.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  At the outset, I want to say that I was not a member of the Committee when the  Bill was discussed, so I may not be as familiar with its every detail as other  Members are. Nevertheless, I agree with the Minister that the safety of  children is everybody&rsquo;s business, not just the responsibility of the Health  Department. It is a cross-departmental thing. However, responsibility has to  rest somewhere, and, in this case, it rests with the Health Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are all aware of the increasing incidence of child  abuse. The number of referrals has increased, as has the number of children on  the child protection register. Unfortunately, in the society in which we live,  abuse is clearly on the increase. A further worrying development linked to that  is the number of controversial cases involving the death of children in recent  years. As we speak, at least one such case is before the courts. We have to  reflect on another side of society today; namely, the fact that those  controversial deaths happened in the home, which, until recently, almost  everyone regarded as a safe and caring place. In view of what has happened, we  can no longer assume that children are safe in their home. Therefore, what the  Bill tries to do is a step in the right direction.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Committee, my party colleagues reflected some  concerns about certain aspects of the Bill, not least the independence of the  chairperson of the board. That appointment appears to be entirely in the hands  of the Department. As the Chairperson stated, the fingerprints of the  Department appear to be all over the steering mechanism of the new board. The  concern was raised in the Committee that the board could publish reports and  other information only with approval from the Department. That is a valid  concern. Social services staff who deal with difficult or controversial cases  largely do a good job, but it is easy to pass on the blame to them. There is  also the issue of public confidence to consider. When an incident leads to a  public outcry, there is a sense among some of the public that the services that  exist to protect children are not properly accountable and transparent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I referred to the independence of the chairperson and the  extent to which the Department may influence what the board would like to  publish or, perhaps, direct that certain information should not be published.  Should that framework remain part of the Bill, it will leave some doubt in the  minds of the public about proper accountability and transparency.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: I  welcome the Bill and commend the Minister for bringing it forward. I agree with  the Chairperson that it has come at an opportune time. I listened to Members  who spoke previously on this important issue, and I agree that the safeguarding  of children is not only a health and social care problem; it is a problem for  society. Therefore, the solution should come from all of us in the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I raised the issue of independence in the Committee. The  board must be independent; there should be no veto from elsewhere. The phrase  &ldquo;subject to the approval of the Department&rdquo;, to which the Chairperson referred,  appears twice in the Bill, which suggests that the board will not be  independent. That gives rise to concern. Another concern is that there are those  of us who say, quite rightly, that safeguarding is not only a health and social  care issue. The Bill suggests that the Department must approve everything that  is contained within it. However, that sends out a wrong message that  safeguarding is purely a health and social care issue, which is not the case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee examined the previous situation in which an  area child protection committee was established for each of the four former  health and social care boards. They appeared to be concerned primarily with  protecting children. In 2006, it was felt that more was needed. We have learned  a lot from the problems that have arisen and the terrible tragedies that have  occurred. The reason for establishing a Safeguarding Board for Northern Ireland  is not only to protect our children but to learn from such tragedies and  prevent them happening again. That is why I welcome the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Safeguarding has been referred to already. It is a new and  correct term. It is good to see the Bill happening so soon, if that is the right  description. However, we must take whatever time is necessary to get it right  as it is important to protect our children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the mistakes that has been apparent to the public  and to all of us as their representatives is the lack of interagency co-operation,  which has been referred to already. Mrs O&rsquo;Neill, the Deputy Chairperson,  already mentioned the incident in the town of Omagh in my area. In that case, people looked  for the reasons why it happened and, in my view, looked only at health and social  care agencies, although we know that other agencies were involved. Although  good work may have been done by various agencies &mdash; I do not know the extent of  that work &mdash; clearly, there was inadequate co-operation on such an important  issue. The Minister also referred to that. However, simply stating that we  should have interagency co-operation is not good enough or strong enough. We  must make it a duty to co-operate; indeed, it should be a legal duty, and  people must co-operate. If it has been found that they have not co-operated,  either through their own choice or because they have underperformed, they  should be held to account.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is good to establish a Safeguarding Board for Northern Ireland,  and I want to add my voice to the comments on the constitution of the board.  When agencies such as the PSNI, the Probation Board for Northern Ireland, the  Youth Justice Agency, the education and library boards, the NSPCC and the  district councils are involved, it shows that people are thinking that it is a  societal problem, and that must be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many people in the front line, including nurses, doctors  and other health professionals in A&amp;E departments and in general practice,  are often the first to discover a situation that is totally unacceptable,  extremely dangerous and life-threatening to our children, and Mr Wells referred  to that fact. The situation must be looked at again, and I look forward to  discussing it in more depth in Committee with the departmental officials and  the Minister. We must ensure that there are avenues available for the different  health professionals who, I hope and believe, all care about our children. They  can quickly initiate a process that will ensure that children at risk are  protected. I agree with the point that was made about a medical and nursing  input, and I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response to that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that the functions of the Safeguarding  Board must be kept under review, and that is important. I welcome the fact that  the board will advise the regional board and the local commissioning groups.  However, one aspect of the functions is  not clear and needs further discussion. Clause 3(6) states:</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-AmendedText">&ldquo;The Safeguarding Board must advise the Regional  Health and Social Care Board and Local Commissioning Groups &hellip;</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-AmendedTextIndent">(a) as soon as reasonably practicable  after receipt of a request for advice; and</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-AmendedTextIndent">(b) on such other occasions as the  Safeguarding Board thinks appropriate.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is not clear enough. It needs to be further  thought out. I would prefer a time frame there and maybe an annual basis. It is  too vague and not precise enough when it comes to something as important as  protecting the lives of children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is good to see that the Safeguarding Board will report  to the Department at least once a year, but again that has to be looked at. The  Bill just suggests the Department; I think it may have to report to more than  the Department. It is also good to see that the Department must lay a copy of  that report before the Assembly, as that will mean that we know about it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another good idea is the establishment of five safeguarding  panels, which will create the legislative framework to allow the SBNI to come  into being. The panels will be coterminous with the five trusts and five local  commissioning groups and will provide feedback to the main Safeguarding Board.  It is also good that these five committees in the five trust areas will report  to the main Safeguarding Board on an annual basis. That is a good thing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Public accountability is vitally important. The public are  very concerned and interested in this and will be watching how we proceed,  because they quite rightly want us to do a professional job for the sake of our  children. Monitoring, reviewing, evaluating and auditing &mdash; to use the term that  all the people tend to like nowadays &mdash; are important to ensure that we are  doing this right and to learn whether we are doing anything wrong.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that the Assembly will know about this board on a  regular basis will mean that Members and the public are kept aware. It is  important that we are accountable and transparent and that the public know  exactly how we are looking after children in Northern Ireland. I look forward to  Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  support the Bill and praise the Minister for bringing forward this legislation  to protect our children. The primary aim of the Bill is set out in clause 1,  which establishes the Safeguarding Board for Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 2 sets out the objectives of the board, which are:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to co-ordinate and ensure the effectiveness of what  is done by each person or body represented on the Board &hellip; for the purposes of  safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We are constantly reminded of the need to protect  and ensure the safety of our children in Northern Ireland. The McElhill  incident in Omagh a number of years ago highlighted the failures of the bodies  and agencies involved and the lack of a joined-up approach to the safety of  those children. There is a need for such a joined-up approach and the new  framework, which is laid out in clause 3, will hopefully go some way to  enhancing that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 3 sets out the functions and respons&shy;ibilities of  the new board. In summary, those include the development of policies and  procedures for safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children; review of  the effectiveness of what is done by each person or body represented on the  board; and advising the Regional Health and Social Care Board and local  commissioning groups on stated aims and objectives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In many ways, the board is a means of ensuring that health  boards and trusts are doing their job correctly in protecting and ensuring the  safety of our children, and I welcome that. The number of children being  referred to social services has increased significantly in recent years.  Indeed, Northern Ireland,  worryingly, has the highest number of children being monitored in the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the establishment of the board as laid out in the  Bill, and I hope that it goes a long way to providing a better framework for  the protection and safeguarding of children. However, I have a number of  concerns. Although money has been found in the Department &mdash; a sum of &pound;750,000  has been quoted &mdash; how can we ensure that the board will stay within its budget?  Many agencies have been established in Northern Ireland to sort out our  problems.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Money is getting tight as we face the onslaught of cuts  from the Budget that will be enacted by the Tory and Lib Dem Government in Westminster. It is  important that we ensure that we are doing the right thing and that the  creation of the board is not simply another act to make it look as if we are  doing something to make it right.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am happy to support the Bill, but we must ensure that it  is worth the money, time and resources, because it is vital that we have the  funding to protect children. I hope that the Minister can give a commitment  that enough funding will be available to do all that and that the board will be  effective and not simply another body to blame if something goes wrong in the  future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One issue that is not included in the Bill, which the  Minister might be able to address, is the lack of a computer system across all  statutory agencies and bodies that deal with child protection issues. It is  vital that, at some stage in the future, a data system be introduced so that all  bodies know exactly where each organisation is in relation to a child  protection issue. I hope that something of that nature will be considered.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I was about to say that it is good to  see the Public Gallery full of children and young people for a debate on child  protection issues. However, they have now walked out, so I do not know whether  we got it right or they became bored with the debate. During the debate, I was  struck by the number of young people who use this place and by their interest  in politics and the legislative process, and it is important that we get the  legislation right for those young people and their future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Along with other Members, I welcome the Bill. If anyone  does not think of it as a positive way forward, we need to ask them where they  are coming from. Many questions need to be asked, which is why we are here. The  Bill&rsquo;s Committee Stage is next in the process, which will allow Assembly  Members to scrutinise its provisions. Members raised some serious questions,  and I hope that the Minister will take the time, if he can, to answer those  questions, alleviate some of the concerns and inform us of where he expects to  take the issue. I commend the Minister for introducing the Bill; it is  important that the process begins as we come to the end of the session. I hope  that, before long, the Bill will become law.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members have done, I commend the Bill&rsquo;s general  principles. At this stage of the debate, my comments probably become  repetitive. A key theme from every speech, including those of the Chairperson  and the Deputy Chairperson, is that a clear and independent voice is needed on  the safeguarding of children. That is critical, and that voice must be  transparent and wholly independent. We must ensure that we are talking about  protecting and safeguarding children and that we are proactive in setting up an  independent body that can do that. The safeguarding of children is paramount,  and it is not a health issue only. Other organisations and agencies need to  take a lead responsibility.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Throughout the years, there have been incidents and cases  within the Churches, some of which have been discussed in this place. Those  incidents demonstrate that a closed system brings added problems, and a clear,  open and transparent system is needed in which the lessons learned from the  past are taken on board. The failure to do anything at the time compounded the  wounds of the children and young people who had been affected by abuse.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The success of the safeguarding board will be based on its  ability to set agreed priorities for collective safeguarding responsibilities,  including a mechanism to hold its members to account and to ensure that there  is an open and transparent system that works in the best interests of children  and young people, especially those who are in need of protection. I am sure  that the Minister will agree that the creation of a board that is independent  and capable of challenge is an essential part of good safeguarding practices.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In that regard, I want to ask a number of questions today.  Other Members have raised some of the points in the course of the debate. The  key issue is the independence of the board, which is critical to ensuring an  effective future safeguarding system for our most vulnerable children. I ask  the Minister to outline today, if he can, how he views the independent nature  of the board. Will that be subject to the Department&rsquo;s involvement? As for  Kieran Deeny before, that raises concerns for me. Parallel to that, will there  be provision in the legislation to ensure that the board will work as  independently as possible? Although I am not saying that I envisage a problem  in the future, we need to ensure that independence means that the board is  wholly and truly independent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tommy Gallagher raised the issue of public confidence. I  agree with Tommy. There have been some horrendous cases over the past number of  years. Again, that goes to the independence of the board. If there is a view  about what the board can and cannot publish, where is the issue of public  confidence? How can we convince the public that we want to move forward and  ensure that we are doing everything in as open and transparent a way as  possible if the board can publish only at the direction of the Department? It  strikes me that we could dent public confidence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members raised the issue of the membership and  involvement of the voluntary and community sector. Can the Minister advise what  arrangements are in place to ensure that the board does not become dominated by  statutory organisations that, as a right, have to be there because they are the  experts? There are many forms of expertise in the community and voluntary  sector, and we need to ensure that the board and the arrangements reflect what  is happening in our communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Somebody has raised the issue of whether two lay members  are enough to achieve a balance or whether the board will be top-heavy with  statutory agencies. We should not shy away from the fact that we have a strong,  vibrant community and voluntary sector, some people in which are experts in  their field. We should utilise that resource to ensure that we come together  collectively to achieve the same aim.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister went into more detail about the child death  review arrangements and the review of serious cases. That needs to be welcomed  and seen as a positive development. However, although the legislation paves the  way for the introduction of a child death overview panel and a case management  review panel, does the Minister expect any changes to, or developments in, the  current case management review process? Then there is the whole issue of the  compliance monitoring requirements. I am conscious that the Minister might not  have all those answers available today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am keen that officials be available during the Committee  Stage. However, we are talking about the general principles of the Bill, and it  is important, at this stage, to try to highlight some issues as early as  possible so that we can have a collective working arrangement and partnership  with the Department. Like everybody in the House, and the Department, I want to  ensure that, when we come to the end of this and agree the Bill, we get it  right and utilise our own resources and expertise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill&rsquo;s memorandum gives a bit of history. The child  protection committees were established in the early 1980s, and, in around 2001  or 2002, Patricia Lewsley, who was a Member at that stage, was taking forward a  private Member&rsquo;s Bill. However, the Assembly was suspended. We need to commend  the Department and its officials from that time because, while the Assembly  went into suspension, they adopted the proposals and took forward some of the  issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The key thing that struck me when the Minister was speaking  was that he kept referring to the passing of information between agencies and  some recent incidents &mdash; again, it was the McElhill case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague highlighted that all the agencies worked very  well up to a point but said that when it got to the stage of sharing  information, some of that was minor information that had major consequences in  the end. That meant that their working well together was no longer the case.  Therefore, I hope that the Bill will deal with that because we are talking  about human life, children and human tragedy. I hope that we will go a long way  to try to ease some of those issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the debate, the all-Ireland child protection issue  struck me. Again, we can refer to some of the incidents in the McElhill case. I  know that the Minister has done a lot of good work on North/South issues, which  is important. We need to ensure that services are interlinked. However, how can  we ensure that, in the border counties, we deal with circumstances where one  jurisdiction is not doing good work and another is a bit behind? We are  allowing our children in the border counties to become more vulnerable as a  result of that situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to the Committee Stage of the Bill, and I  look forward to working with the Minister and his officials and with the  community and voluntary sector on the issue. I commend the Second Stage of the  Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I am not a member of the Health Committee, and I will not pretend to know the  detail that a Committee member should know, but this issue is of personal  interest to me. I welcome the Bill and its broad intent. As other Members  stated, the protection and safeguarding of all our children, particularly the  most vulnerable, is an important measure of any society, and I commend the  Minister for bringing the issue forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past number of years, too many high-profile  incidents involving children have been linked to protection and safeguarding  issues. The Bill is an important reminder that the business of safeguarding and  protecting all our children does not belong to social services alone but to the  key statutory and voluntary agencies and organisations that work with children  and families. Ultimately, it belongs to all of us as adults in our community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill represents an opportunity to create a different  approach to and a cultural shift in safeguarding in Northern Ireland. It represents an  opportunity to create not simply a mechanism whereby the agencies that are  directly involved in safeguarding can come together but a place that will allow  for critical reflection on the effectiveness and outcomes of safeguarding in  order for it to work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members may be aware, I have had a significant interest  in, and commitment to, the issue of young people who go missing from care and  home. I have had the same interest in and commitment to the risks that they may  face. Indeed, we have dedicated time to the issue and have debated it in the  House. As the Minister is aware, I have undertaken an early consultation on the  issue with a view to proposing a private Member&rsquo;s Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I recently met with the Minister&rsquo;s officials to agree a way  forward. I will take this opportunity to thank the Minister and to seek  confirmation of his agreement to put in place an administrative system for the  collection, collation and reporting of quarterly statistics on the numbers and  incidents of young people who go missing from care and run away. I also seek  confirmation of his agreement to the production of an action plan to deal with  young people who go missing from care or home. I look forward to seeing those  developments being put in place as a further means of ensuring that our most  vulnerable young people are protected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, I welcome the focus of the Bill, but, similar to  other Members, I should point out that a number of clauses cause me some  concern. Good child protection practice acknowledges that the capacity for the  independent challenge of government and local agencies is a key element in any  well-functioning safeguarding board. However, like the Chairperson and members  of the Committee, I have not been assured that the board as it is currently  constituted could undertake such a challenge. Indeed, I am personally aware of  how difficult it can be to raise issues that are perceived as a challenge, even  when one&rsquo;s intention is simply to ensure greater protection. Therefore, will  the Minister clarify what provisions in the Bill will allow for the chairperson  of the board and the board itself to provide a clear challenge role? I am also  concerned that, too often whenever Members seek information on the nature and  extent of child protection issues, it is not available or is not held in a  format where it can be analysed and used to inform better decision-making for  children and young people.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a Member who does not sit on the Health Committee, I  independently highlighted clause 3(9)(c), as the Chairman mentioned, which states that SBNI may:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;subject to the approval of the Department, publish  any matter concerning safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Although I am sure that it is not the Minister&rsquo;s intention  to do so, that could create the perception that the Department is attempting to  restrict the board&rsquo;s independence and that information or commentary would be  perceived to be negative or critical. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s view on why he  considers departmental approval on publication of information by the SBNI to be  necessary and on whether he believes that a crucial element of the board&rsquo;s  independence will be its ability to publish a range of issues and information  that is required to ensure that the safeguarding system works at its best.  Overall, how the board will function independently is critical to ensuring a  more effective safeguarding system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I very much welcome the commitment that the Minister has  shown to child safeguarding and welfare. I reiterate my thanks for his  agreement to move forward on issues that relate to children who go missing or  run away from care or home.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Like previous Members who have spoken in the debate, I support the Bill&rsquo;s  objective wholeheartedly and I thank the Minister and his officials for the  work that they have done to get it to Second Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill&rsquo;s history has been well rehearsed by previous  Members. However, it is worth noting that if it were possible to describe a  Bill that has been introduced by an Ulster Unionist Minister as one that has an  SDLP genesis, the Safeguarding Board Bill is it. Many could argue that the  Assembly would not be debating the legislation if it were not for work done by  Patricia Lewsley, a former party colleague in the House who is now Children&rsquo;s  Commissioner. During the Assembly&rsquo;s first mandate and her previous work, Ms  Lewsley did the running to get the Bill into the statutory process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At this stage, it is worth focusing on what safeguarding  should be about. As has been highlighted by previous Members and the Committee  Chairperson, the key objective that has arisen out of Lord Laming&rsquo;s report is  to be able to ensure that an independent body exists that has a high degree of  autonomy and sufficient power to ensure that all agencies of the state and  others who are involved in safeguarding of children can be held to account and  have a duty to co-operate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are the basic  tests that must be applied to the legislation: whether it ensures the  independence of the proposed safeguarding board, and its chairperson, in  particular; whether it provides sufficient basis for such independence; whether  the board has the capacity to operate and determine its work in a sufficiently  independent way so that it can enjoy public confidence and never have to  demonstrate dependence on its sponsoring agency or Department, nor give rise to  a perception of that dependency, which is equally important; and, finally,  whether it enables the board to behave with its own distinct and clear identity  and to be able to hold all of those people who represent various bodies on the  safeguarding board to a common duty, which is to co-operate in the interests of  safeguarding, no matter what the implications are for the body that they  represent on the board or for wider public policy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the first test, I am disappointed to find  that on a cursory reading of the Bill, it seems to be silent on independence.  It acknowledges the genesis of safeguarding but it does not mention  independence. I stand to be corrected, and if I am wrong, I will happily  withdraw the specific comment. However, I do not see the word &ldquo;independence&rdquo; in  the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not see that key characteristic defined and spelt out  in law in a way that it clearly and obviously must be. It is particularly  disappointing that it is not there, because it was raised at Committee meetings  when members were receiving evidence from officials before the Bill&rsquo;s  introduction. Officials agreed that independence should be included, but that  does not appear to have happened.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Independence  is not mentioned at a strategic level in the Bill, and is it not included in  the characteristics, specific duties or role of the chairman. Furthermore, it  is not stipulated as a requirement in the appointment process for the chairman. Independence is assumed: however, Mr Speaker, we  cannot make assumptions on matters of safeguarding; we must be specific and  clear.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards identity, the Bill is again clear in  establishing a body and in the organisations that should be around the table,  as listed in clause 1(3). However, it leaves too many connections with the  Department, in a paternalistic sense, to be able to reinforce a distinct sense  of identity. That begs the next question. The Bill outlines a statutory duty to  co-operate, which is important and welcome, but that statutory duty in the  Bill, as it stands during the Second Stage debate, extends only to those  organisations listed in clause 1(3). The list does not include a single  Department. Therefore, the statutory duty applies to officers of the regional  health and social care board, the Public Health Agency, the PSNI, the Probation  Board, the Youth Justice Agency, etc, but, unless I am misreading it &mdash; and, if  I am I will happily accept the Minister&rsquo;s correction in his reply &mdash; I do not  see how it applies to officials of the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety, the Department of Justice, the Office of the First and  deputy First Minister, or the Department of Education, all of whom have clear  and distinct safeguarding responsibilities. They are responsible for policy  areas that are related to the safeguarding of children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I suppose that that begs another question: why do none of  those Departments have any form of representation on the safeguarding board?  Why are we not bringing everyone who has a potential duty to children in this  region, be that at policy, delivery or protection level, on to the board?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have a final observation at this stage. The debate is  welcome. The arguments that members of the Health Committee will have during  Committee Stage, and which the rest of us will have during further stages, will  not be on the principles of the Bill or whether this is a good idea. The  arguments will be about whether the legislation delivers what we want it to  deliver, which is the certainty that never again will the state fail a child  who is in a vulnerable situation, and that never again will we have the need to  ask the Minister, or for the Minister or other Ministers, to conduct inquiries  into how or why the state let children down.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To be able to reach that level of certainty, we must go  deeper with this legislation; we must be more ambitious and brave about the  extent to which we are willing to establish a safeguarding board that is  independent in name, spirit, character and culture. We must also be ambitious  and brave about the extent to which we will tie in not only those listed  organisations, but every other relevant body, such as a Department that could  or might have a duty with regard to children in this region, into making that  legislation a reality for the protection of children.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I support the Bill, and, as other  Members have done, commend the Health Minister and his Department for the work  that has been done so far on the protection of children in general and on  raising awareness of the difficulties that people who work in child protection  and, in particular, families experience. I commend the Minister for focusing on  the child. He said that the Bill, and the law that we hope will flow from it,  is designed to put the child at the centre of what we do. We all support that aim.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Bill do that? Let us hope so. Let us hope that it  will put the child at the centre and that the ensuing legislative framework  will ensure that that happens. We have had legislation and structures before,  and there have been any number of strategies and attempts to put in place the  structures that are needed to protect children. Sadly, however, those  structures failed on occasions. We can all point to the high-profile cases,  which other Members have mentioned. In my area, we had the McElhill/McGovern  tragedy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">While reading documentation on the Bill and thinking about  my contribution to the debate, I wondered whether the Bill will ensure that we  listen to the child. That is key, and the Minister spoke about putting the  child at the centre. We need to ensure that the Bill does put the child at the  centre, whatever about the structures, which are absolutely essential. It is  important that we listen to the child. VOYPIC and other organisations that  promote the well-being and welfare of children take that line, as do we as  elected Members. Everyone agrees that the child should be at the centre.  However, we must ensure that legislation formally puts in place the necessary  structures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Evidence that was presented in the wake of the  McElhill/McGovern tragedy showed that when one of the young people involved  spoke graphically and dramatically on the phone, she may not have been listened  to in the way in which she should have been. The Minister commissioned Henry  Toner to chair an independent review of the tragedy, and he made a number of  recommendations. Subsequently, Henry Toner went back to make sure that where  there were deficiencies in the trusts and agencies charged with looking after  children&rsquo;s welfare, they were being addressed. It is my understanding that in  many cases, and possibly all, those deficiencies were addressed by the health  authorities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the health agencies, other organisations  have a role to play, but they do not always communicate information to the  relevant people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When we examine the Bill at Committee Stage, I will be  looking for reassurance that clause 11 will ensure that the Safeguarding Board  requests the supply of information. We will have to work out which key people  will need that information, and, if it is critical to a particular case, there  must be an opportunity for it to be brought forward quickly and worked on in  the way that it needs to be by the key agencies and organisations.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When the Committee heard evidence from them, departmental  officials agreed that communication was key. As the Deputy Chairperson said,  co-operation across agencies is key. That was lacking in the high-profile  cases, and we need to learn from that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I will return to my point about putting the child  at the centre. Young people spoke to the Committee during formal and informal  evidence sessions, and that was very insightful and helpful. I again emphasise  that although the structures are crucial to what happens with this matter, it  is important that, as the Minister said, we put the child at the centre. I  support the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  welcome the Minister to the Chamber to debate what is a very important Bill,  which will significantly affect front line services and all forms of social  services in child protection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest, as I am on a career break from the  South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust. When I started in social work, we  worked to the Children and Young Persons Act (Northern Ireland) 1968 &mdash; I am old  enough to remember that. The Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 was  then developed, and we worked to that. In those days, I worked for the Eastern  Health and Social Services Board, in Marmion children&rsquo;s home. I moved to the  Western Health and Social Services Board to work in Conywarren children&rsquo;s home,  which subsequently fell under the Sperrin Lakeland Trust. I then came back to  front line social work and child protection, working with what was the North  Down and Ards Trust, which then became the Ulster Community and Hospitals  Trust. I finished my career in the South Eastern Trust. It was an interesting  progression.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister will be aware that many of his staff, who are  former colleagues of mine, do an outstanding job on the front line of child  protection. For 21 years, I had the privilege to serve; I say that I was  privileged, but it was also hard work. In the course of that work, we were  threatened and assaulted. When we put through the joint protocol procedures  with the police and took cases and gave evidence in court, it was not unusual  for us to be threatened that people would rape our children. We had our lives  and homes threatened and our cars damaged, yet those men and women still get up  and go to work, and if they get a child protection referral, they will  investigate it within 24 hours, as per the regulations and guidance. No matter  what workload they have or how hard it is, the men and women on the front line  of child protection will continue on, regardless of the circumstances. I am  sure that the Minister is as proud as I am of those staff.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There have been major cases. I am old enough to remember  right back to Jessica Kingsley, through to the McElhill/McGovern case and the  recent case in the Strangford constituency, where a young girl tragically lost  her life.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the Safeguarding Board continue to  work within what we always called the five Ps, which are the five principles  that we work by. The first, which my colleague opposite raised, is paramountcy.  The paramountcy principle always reigns supreme in court. The welfare of the child  is always the paramount consideration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The five principles enabled everyone to look at what was in  the best interests of the child, and they also contained the partnership  approach. It is vital that we give parents and caregivers their place and that we  work in partnership to safeguard children, working principally with parents and  other caregivers, foster parents, adoptive parents or whoever the situation  brings forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must promote parenting and look to prevention. We must  also look to early intervention, and the Safeguarding Board can co-ordinate the  services and provide the safeguarding plan, which can be reviewed annually in  the safeguarding report to ensure that there is a genuine partnership approach  with parents and all the relevant agencies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally comes the issue of protection. We must never shy  away from that, but it is difficult. I have had to remove children from their  homes in tears in the early hours of the morning, and it is difficult.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the things that the Safeguarding Board Bill will be  looking at is foster caring. I want to pay a sincere tribute to foster carers.  I will never break confidence with regard to any of my professional work, but  it is not unusual to go out at 2.00 am or 3.00 am to deal with an overdose or a  serious case of self-harm and find that there is no one to care for the  children. The social worker goes into the house, and those traumatised and  frightened children leave with that social worker, who is a stranger, someone  whom they have never met before. One of the most wonderful and rewarding  aspects of social work is when one goes in the early hours of the morning to  see an emergency foster parent &mdash; I am getting a lump in my throat now &mdash; and a  foster parent comes to the door with two hot-water bottles in their hands for  two young children, puts their arms around those young children and gives them  the immediate care and love that they need. You can see those children just  dissolve from you &mdash; the social worker, the bad person who has almost broken up  their family &mdash; into the love and care of our foster carers across Northern  Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We owe those people a significant debt. They do not do it  for money; money would not pay them to do what they do. I have been there in  the early hours of the morning when they have got out of their beds, prepared  homes and bedrooms and brought children in, ready with hot chocolate for them.  They welcome them with hot-water bottles and provide them with the security  that they need.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Also critical will be the multidisciplinary approach. Major  progress has been made by the Police Service of Northern Ireland and social  services on the joint protocol arrangements for investigation. As was said  earlier, that flow of information is important. What the Safeguarding Board  Bill does is allow us to look at good practice elsewhere. We have had the  establishment of the Northern Ireland Social Care Council. One of the  significant aspects of all that for professionals in the field is that they  have to do 15 full days of lifelong learning and continuous professional  development over a three-year period, and that is verified by their line  manager.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we learn the lessons that are out  there. One of the principal lessons concerned the flow of information. In the  child protection case conference system, we can now see that safeguarding  nurses and health visitors are on board, there is increased involvement from  the education sector and GPs and we have a multidisciplinary analysis that will  ultimately serve to protect the child better.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There will be difficult times, because, sadly, there are  people out there who will seek to use children for their own mean and  vindictive ends, for their own sexual gratification. It is important that,  through its multidisciplinary approach, the Safeguarding Board co-operates with  the likes of the MASRAM &mdash; multi-agency sex offender risk assessment and management  &mdash; services and the police so that we have co-ordinated protection. In my view,  it will never be possible to provide a 100% foolproof child protection system,  but we should never stop striving towards that. We should constantly look at  where good practice leads us and constantly monitor ourselves, as the  Safeguarding Board will, against what is identified in the Children (Northern Ireland)  Order 1995 as a welfare checklist. That is, all decisions should be tailored to  the age, stage and circumstances of the child.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is vital that the obligations prescribed under the Human  Rights Act 1998 be observed. We want to keep children with their families,  because, as most of the research shows, that is where they are best cared for.  We want to look at alternatives to taking children into care.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have worked in a number of children&rsquo;s homes, and I pay  sincere tribute to the staff there. During a 25-hour shift, staff take many of  the young people to do their day-to-day activities, such as education or  religious observance, and to their normal outlets and, as a result, they get to  know the children and their families very well. Therefore, it can be absolutely  devastating for them when they lose one of the children to an overdose or an  accident, but they have to go back to work the next day and carry on. That is  what those professionals do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have known young people who, sadly, were the victims of  abuse, were taken into the professional care of a children&rsquo;s home and,  subsequently, were fostered out, where, in very rare cases, they were abused  for a second time. When many of those young people came back in to the care  system &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The  honourable Member is giving us a useful insight into social work and child  protection. It is good that we have someone of his experience on board in the  Assembly. Does the Member accept that is it unfortunate that, when a social  worker does a great job and protects a child, it is never mentioned in the  media? The Member indicated that cases cannot be mentioned in the media for  good reason, namely to protect the confidentiality of parents, foster parents  and children. However, on the one in 1,000 occasions when something goes badly  wrong, the story is front page news.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Member accept that it is regrettable that able,  young people are being put off social work because of front page headlines  about the occasional examples where something goes wrong and because they  seldom hear the sort of information that he is providing to the Assembly about  the thousands of examples where it goes right and children are protected? I  have yet to see a headline on the front page of any of the daily papers that  reads &ldquo;Child protected&rdquo;, but the headline &ldquo;Child neglected&rdquo; makes the front  pages.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: The  honourable Member makes his point well. As he and the Minister know, and as the  evidence base bears out, the vast majority of children who enter the child  protection system and who, after a multidisciplinary case conference, are designated  as having suffered, potentially or actually, significant harm in any of the  three categories of abuse, subsequently come off the child protection register.  That means that plans were put in place to look at education, childcare,  health, trauma counselling and support for parents. In my experience, the vast  majority of children who are put on the child protection register are  subsequently discharged from it, and the evidence base will bear that out. One  of the joys of social work is being able to deregister a child.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Social workers who do such work do not do it for the glory,  and they certainly do not do it for the money. They do it because it is their  vocation. Social work is one of the few professions where an individual who  goes to a house and says &ldquo;I am a social worker in family and childcare with  such and such, and I am here to follow up on a child protection concern&rdquo; will  almost always be automatically met with a level of hostility. Social work is  the one professional service that many people do not want to see. However,  social workers have to manage that in a diplomatic way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has excellent staff, some of whom have been  attacked or have had their cars damaged, and yet they respond to those children  with care and love. Those staff help children, such as those suffering  flashbacks from abuse in children&rsquo;s homes, through a key work programme and an  assessed programme of individual and group work and can manage, in most cases,  to bring them to a better place than where they were when they first entered  the system. They can diffuse a lot of anger and trauma and help the children to  move forward in a constructive way. The House owes a great debt of gratitude to  those staff who deal with children who have been abused, sometimes multiple  times, or who have been the victims of organised abuse.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to be fair to the Minister, with whom I have crossed  swords many times on a political level. During the past two years, when the  front line services of social work were under significant pressure &mdash; as I saw  when I worked on the front line &mdash; new money was allocated, and new social  workers were put in place to serve the need that existed in child protection. I  congratulate the Minister on that. He should enjoy that praise, because I do  not intend to make a habit of congratulating him.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must learn from best practice and concentrate on how to  do things better, not on where things went wrong. It was pointed out to me  that, in a significant case in which a child died, a major daily newspaper  published a photograph of the social worker involved. However, as the Minister  said previously in the House, in response to my question on the tragedy of  Darlene Bell in Newtownards, social services cannot do everything on their own.  With its multidisciplinary approach, the new board will enshrine the principle  of safeguarding. Social workers rely on early years teams, families, carers,  grandparents, teachers, Youth Service staff, youth clubs and district council  provisions, such as summer schemes in leisure centres, to provide a collective  approach, not only to the early identification of child abuse but to creating a  structured plan for any children with whom they are involved. As Jim Wells  said, the papers do not broadcast the discharge of a child from the child protection  register or the fact that a child has overcome an addiction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On a wider level, safeguarding children is a matter for  everyone in society. The situation of young people is serious, as can be seen  in Londonderry Park, Strangford. Today, in any major  supermarket, alcohol is cheaper than water and is purchased for minors. Drug  dealers provide a gateway into drug abuse for children by offering them free  cannabis to get them hooked on a higher level of drugs, then using them either  as runners or for more nefarious purposes. We must work collectively as a  society. The Minister was correct to say that social services alone will not be  able to safeguard children. We must learn from experience.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill provides the Department with a veto on reports. If  that veto is used, it should be used with due caution and regard, because we  want information to be made available. We should examine any tragedies and  difficulties to find out what can be done better.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I spent five years at university, where I studied for a three-year  psychology degree and a two-year master&rsquo;s degree in social work, but social  workers will never know it all. Social work is a lifelong learning process in  which people must use and learn from experience. Such experience must be  examined constructively to see how we can provide better care for the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the case that I mentioned, the social worker&rsquo;s  photograph was published. However, were photographs published of the doctors,  teachers, carers or parents involved in that case? We must be watchful and  ensure that we do not create a system that victimises social workers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Someone sent me a cartoon for my office. On one side was a  social worker being hanged for removing a child from a family, and on the other  side was a mirror image of a social worker being hanged for not removing a  child from a family. Social workers will always act in the paramount interests  of the child. However, to enable them to do so requires an effective and  multidisciplinary Safeguarding Board. I commend the Minister and those responsible  for drawing up the Bill, which goes some way to ensuring that the children of Northern Ireland  will be better protected than they have been to date.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I thank all Members who  contributed to this important debate for their interest in the subject and for  their remarks. Clearly, all of us have a shared objective.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also take the opportunity to recognise the extremely  difficult job &mdash; as Mr Bell said, and he knows better than I &mdash; that professionals  in child services do, day in and day out, to keep children safe. As Mr Bell  said, they do not do it for the money, and I am aware of that. If they do a  good job, they often get little thanks, but when things go wrong, as Mr Wells  said, anger can be heaped on their heads.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For a very unlucky few children, any failure from us to  keep on top of our game can mean tragic circumstances. That is why we are  always looking to improve. Conall McDevitt said that he wanted certainty that  the state would never fail. Sadly, we will never get to the point where we have  that certainty, but, as Mr Bell said, we are striving to get there. That is the  point; we are always reaching forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of points were made, and I will try to refer to as  many as I can, because they were very important. The Committee Stage will play  a very important role as Members deliberate the way forward. There are issues  around independence, accountability, reporting, and so on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to remember that the board will focus  explicitly on core issues around child protection and protecting children who  are at risk. Those are issues that fall mainly to agencies that operate within  the Department of Health and the Department of Justice. Beyond that, there  needs to be a focus on the broader safeguarding issues that affect the agencies  of all Departments. This is an Executive Bill, and all Departments are on  board, so we do not need to name in the Bill the Departments or non-statutory  agencies that work with or provide services to children or parents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is the scope and remit of the Bill, which is about  ensuring that we do not work in silos and that we do have a joined-up approach.  We are always striving to get to the point where we are providing the best  protection that we possibly can.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The role of the board&rsquo;s chairperson is very important. Jim  Wells talked about the integrity of the chairperson and how important it was  that the right type of chairperson be found. That is a key issue that we will  consider very carefully. The board should act as a critical friend, but it  should be more than that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the chairperson of this body be  accountable, through the Minister and the Executive, to the House. There is no  such thing as absolute independence, particularly when a body is funded  entirely by the public purse. It is also important that there be a line of  accountability through the Minister and the Executive to the House, because,  ultimately, it is the House and Members who will oversee the board&rsquo;s actions.  Ultimately, the board and its chairperson will be responsible to Members and  the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Directions will be issued to the chairperson primarily for  reasons of good housekeeping to ensure that all the agencies in my Department  and the Department of Justice, and other agencies that are involved, are  following good practice. If directions have to be issued, it may be that the  chairperson will have asked for them. However, that will be done in the public  domain, so any directions issued will be subject to oversight by and accountability  to the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that there are a number of matters that need to be  teased out. I want everyone in the House to be as comfortable as possible with  the way that we are going forward. The issues of independence and  accountability, and the board&rsquo;s capacity as a critical friend are all  absolutely key in getting it right. Of course, we will not get it right in the  first shot. The process will be refined as we evolve, as we always strive to go  forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I thought  that the Department showed a very flexible approach in its dealings with the  Committee on the Sunbeds Bill. As the Committee continued its deliberations on  that Bill, the Department and the Minister&rsquo;s officials considered issues that  were raised at Second Stage, and they started to forward amendments to the  Committee during Committee Stage in reaction to our comments. By the time that  the process on that Bill is finished, we will have the best legislation in Europe on sunbeds, and that is to be welcomed. We are all  delighted with the progress that has been made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister clearly has an open mind about some issues  that were raised in today&rsquo;s debate, and he will, no doubt, go back to his  officials to ask them to tease out what can be done to meet the Committee&rsquo;s  concerns. Will the Minister assure us that he will follow the same procedure  with the Safeguarding Board Bill that he followed with the Sunbeds Bill so that  if, on reflection, his officials suggest amendments, he will feed those through  to the Committee so that we can deliberate on them, rather than have amendments  coming in at Consideration Stage? The Committee found that what he did with the  Sunbeds Bill was extremely useful.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I thank Mr Wells for those  remarks. I am happy to give that assurance. I want us to get the very best  piece of legislation that we possibly can. We have a shared objective, which is  protecting children, and we work together in doing that. I am happy to assure  the Member that we will tease out the legislation as best we can at Committee  Stage so that we can go forward. That is the right way to proceed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members raised issues about the Public Health  Agency. That is merely somewhere to anchor this body to ensure that it has  lines of accountability and the ability to talk to me as necessary. All the  organisations that are involved in this matter have a duty to co-operate as we  move forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that Committee Stage properly reflects  Members&rsquo; views and that amendments are properly weighed as they come forward.  We all have a shared view on this matter, and it is a case of getting to the  point when that shared view is laid down. As Members reflect on the Bill, I  believe that they will agree that it represents a solid foundation for the  discussion on safeguarding and promoting the welfare of our children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that we will never be complacent and that we  have to seek continually to build on, strengthen and improve arrangements to  ensure that all our children and young people are afforded a high standard of  protection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Once again, I am grateful to those Members who contributed  to a very productive debate on an extremely important piece of legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call the Minister of the Environment to move the Consideration  Stage of the Wildlife and Natural Environment Bill</p>

    <p class="BillAmend-Moved">Moved. &mdash; [The Minister of the Environment (Mr Poots).]</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Members will have a copy of the Marshalled List of amendments  detailing the order for consideration. The amendments have been grouped for  debate in my provisional grouping of amendments selected list. Let me explain  the groupings. There are four groups of amendments, and we will debate the  amendments in each group in turn. The first debate will be on amendment Nos 1  to 5, which deal with strengthening the new biodiversity duty, enhancing  reporting requirements and imposing related duties on public bodies. The second  debate will be on amendment No 6 and related amendments, as set out in the  provisional grouping list. Those amendments deal with the level of protection  afforded to various species of animals, birds and plants. The third debate will  be on amendment No 8 and other amendments set out on the provisional grouping  list. That group deals with snares, hare coursing and other methods of killing  or taking animals and birds, together with the Minister&rsquo;s opposition to clause  15. The final debate will be on amendment Nos 21 to 24, which deal with enhancing  the protection afforded to areas of special scientific interest (ASSIs).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members who intend to speak that, during the  debates on the four groups of amendments, they should address all the  amendments in each group on which they wish to comment. Once the initial debate  on each group is completed, any subsequent amendments in the group will be  moved formally as we go through the Bill, and the Question on each will be put  without further debate. The Questions on stand part will be taken at the appropriate  points in the Bill. If that is clear, we shall proceed.</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-ClauseHeading">Clause 1 (Duty to conserve biodiversity)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: We now come to the first group of amendments for debate. With  amendment No 1, it will be convenient to debate amendment Nos 2 to 5. Those  amendments deal with the new biodiversity duty to be placed on public bodies.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: A number of amendments that we will debate today arise  from recommendations made by the Environment Committee. I want to express my  appreciation for the work that Committee members have done and for the timely  manner of their consideration of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first group of amendments is concerned with the new  statutory biodiversity duty. That duty is being placed on all public bodies.  Amendment No 1 relates to clause 1(4), which gives the Department discretion to  issue guidance to assist public bodies to comply with the new biodiversity  duty. Although it is intended that the Department will issue such guidance, the  Environment Committee felt that the Bill should make it obligatory. I agree  that such an obligation should be placed on the Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 2 concerns the biodiversity strategy, and clause  2(4) places a duty on the Department to publish reports regarding  implementation of the strategy &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo;. The Committee expressed  concern during Committee Stage that the reporting period was not explicit. It  felt that the Department should be obliged to publish such reports at least  once every five years. I fully acknowledge the importance of knowing what  progress is being made in implementing the biodiversity strategy. That  information is crucial to inform adherence to our national and international  obligations to reduce biodiversity loss. Therefore, I agree with the  Committee&rsquo;s recommendation and the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The final amendments in the group &mdash; Nos 3, 4 and 5 &mdash;  concern clause 3(3). The Environment Committee considered that the obligation  to conserve flora and fauna should apply to all public bodies. That stance  would be consistent with the overriding general biodiversity duty. It also  places focus on the habitats and species that are under greatest risk in Northern Ireland.  I propose to amend clause 3(3) in line with the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations.  Those are the amendments in group 1.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. On behalf of the Committee, I welcome the Consideration  Stage. I am sure Committee members will agree that the Bill offers an  opportunity to improve the protection of our environment. That is timely and  welcome. Having looked closely at the Bill and what it has to offer, I am  confident that it will take us a significant step forward in how we look after  our wildlife and maintain the many beautiful places that make the North so  special.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill was referred to the Committee on 13 January 2010  to ensure that there was enough time to scrutinise the wide-scoping  legislation. The Committee sought a 13-week extension and, as members will  confirm, it needed that time to go through the Bill&rsquo;s many complexities and  hear what people had to say about its proposals. The Committee received written  submissions from more than 35 organisations and individuals and took oral  evidence from those representing the widest possible range of interested  parties in the time available. Its report was concluded on 15 April 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s detailed scrutiny led to 16  recommendations. I am pleased to report that most of them have been accepted by  the Minister and are reflected in the amendments we are considering today. I  thank the Minister for his co-operative approach and for taking so many of the  Committee&rsquo;s recommendations on board. However, not all the Committee&rsquo;s  recommendations have been addressed, and some have been addressed only in part.  The Committee has, therefore, tabled its own amendments. I will go through them  in more detail during the long consideration ahead of us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that my Committee colleagues will support me in  noting the good working relationship that was established between the Committee  and the departmental officials during Committee Stage. That certainly helped  the process along and paid dividends when it came to agreeing recommendations  for amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I talk specifically about the amendments in the  first group, I wish to note three of the Committee&rsquo;s key concerns that it  believes are vitally important to the successful implementation of the Bill but  which cannot be addressed in this primary legislation. First, on several  occasions, the Department referred to guidance it would issue to ensure that  interpretation of the Bill was accurate and consistent. To be effective, such  guidance must be produced in a timely way and in close collaboration with the  bodies it applies to. Secondly, the Committee repeatedly heard of the need for  the punishment to fit the crime for wildlife and environment offences.  Penalties must not only reflect the cost of repairing and restoring damages  caused by these crimes but act as a strong deterrent to others and show that, when  it comes to protecting the environment in the North, crime does not  pay.Thirdly, the Committee is aware that other regions are already in the  process of putting their updated wildlife protection legislation in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Lessons are being learned across these islands, and the  Committee urges the Department to keep an eye on progress elsewhere, picking up  examples of best practice for implementation here. The Committee is  particularly keen for the Department to take cognisance of and apply Scotland&rsquo;s  novel approaches to preventing and controlling invasive alien species.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now comment on the first group of amendments. Many  organisations and the Department itself noted the importance of guidance on how  public bodies will meet the new biodiversity duties to be introduced by the  Bill. The Committee suggested that the wording for the production of such  guidance should be made much stronger so that, rather than indicate that the  Department &ldquo;may&rdquo; produce guidance, the Bill will provide that the Department  &ldquo;must&rdquo; produce guidance. The Committee was pleased that the Department tabled  amendment No 1, which will change clause 1 to that effect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also considered the suggestion from many  stakeholders that the wording of clause 1, which requires species and habitats  to be restored or enhanced, should be augmented to include &ldquo;maintaining and  protecting&rdquo;. In Committee, the Department advised that it would consider  tabling an amendment to achieve that. However, the Minister recently informed  the Committee that no such amendment would be tabled. Instead, a full  definition of what was required to meet the biodiversity duty would be included  in the guidance that I referred to earlier. The Committee agreed that it was  content with that approach.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 2, which the Minister tabled, also reflects  concerns that the Committee raised. As drafted, clause 2 would require a report  on the implementation of a biodiversity strategy to be published &ldquo;from time to  time&rdquo;. The Committee felt that to be far too vague. Although the Department  indicated that the reporting period for the current biodiversity strategy is  every three years, the Committee wanted a specific time frame included in the  Bill to ensure that there could be no slippage on the reporting periods with  future strategies. The Committee suggested that the reporting period should be  no longer than every five years, so it welcomes the Minister&rsquo;s amendment, which  will require a report to be published &ldquo;not  later than 5 years&rdquo; after a biodiversity strategy comes into operation and:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;at least once in every period of 5 years thereafter&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 3, 4 and 5 relate to clause 3 and again  reflect concerns that the Committee raised. The Committee understood that the  Bill would introduce a new biodiversity duty on all public bodies in the  exercise of their functions. Members were concerned that the obligations in  clause 3 would apply only to the Department. On behalf of the Committee, I  therefore welcome amendment Nos 3, 4 and 5, which will extend that duty to  public bodies.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I congratulate the Minister and his Department on the Wildlife and Natural  Environment Bill. It is an important Bill to come before us for legislative  debate. I have been involved at every stage of the Bill and know how much work  and consultation has been carried out. That is the first point that I would  like noted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest as a country sportsman, as a member  of the Countryside Alliance and of the British Association for Shooting and  Conservation (BASC), and as one person among thousands who contribute to the  value of conservation across the Province. The input of those bodies and people  is very important. I am one of the thousands of men and women who take pleasure  in country sports and pour thousands of pounds into our economy through their  pastimes and hobbies. I am one of those, along with thousands of others, who  takes seriously his conservation duty and considers it an intrinsic part of  country sports.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">An independent study and report by PACEC showed that  shooting contributes &pound;45 million to the Northern Ireland economy, &pound;10  million of which is spent on habitat improvement and wildlife management.  Therefore, I fully support much of what is in the Bill, and I will speak to all  the groups of amendments. The first group of amendments concerns clause 1,  which relates to the biodiversity duty.I wanted to make those introductory  remarks, and I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to  do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Conservation is one of the issues that we in the Province  must take seriously. We undoubtedly have the richest beauty in the whole United Kingdom,  and we need to protect and enhance that. Amendment No 1 will amend clause 1 so  that the Department &ldquo;must&rdquo; issue guidance. That firms up the notion of  guidance. My only issue is the prohibitive cost of issuing guidelines to every  public body. At the same time, I can see the benefit of each body being aware  of its biodiversity duties. I have only a short comment to make on biodiversity  duty.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 2 puts in place a timescale, as opposed to  &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo;. That is good, because a Bill must be clear and specific,  leaving no grey areas. It is important that we put things down categorically in  black and white, rather than leaving it to someone to decide at some time in  the future what they want to do. I agree that five years is a good timescale in  which to work, taking into account the cycle of nature itself.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 3, 4 and 5 put the onus on public bodies, as  opposed to just the Department. That will ensure continuity of approach and  strategy across the different sectors with reference to flora and fauna. I  support the group 1 amendments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I, too, declare an interest. I am a farmer looking after about 200 acres of  land and the historic buildings and wildlife that go with it. I am extremely  pleased to speak on this subject; it is vital that we do so. It is a year since  I made my maiden speech, in which I said that I would fight hard for the rural  community when I felt that the urban community was taking over or threatening  it. This Bill has one or two items in it that we need to fight extremely hard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall start with one or two general points. This is where  the Assembly is at its best &mdash; making Northern Ireland a better place to  live for us and for the wildlife. However, it falls on us to make the  decisions. Many stakeholders have come and spoken to us, and it is our job to  balance all the information in order to make the right decisions. Sometimes  that information is not perfect, and sometimes it is laced with emotion.  Therefore, we have to be the wise ones here; we have to try to be Solomon. The  Environment Committee is fortunate because we have a Minister who listens, on  which I congratulate him. In some Departments, it is evident that the Committee  and the Minister do not work well together.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are here not just to protect wildlife but to preserve  ways of life, and that is the balance that we have to get, without being  draconian. We have to listen and decide, and we have listened to evidence about  hares, traps, ASSIs and other things. Today, we make those decisions. As the  Chairperson said, we have to find the best practice. All along, we have known  that much of this will fall on the law-abiding people of Northern Ireland,  whom I congratulate. However, many will break the rules and ignore what we are  doing, so we have to find ways of catching them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to the biodiversity duty &mdash; Members may get  bored hearing me say this &mdash; I want to make sure that we put things in language  that we can all understand. I have raised this many times. We and some people  in councils may understand what &ldquo;biodiversity&rdquo; means. A year ago, I picked up  my &lsquo;Oxford English Dictionary&rsquo;, and I discovered that there is no such word as  &ldquo;biodiversity&rdquo;. We have to find a plain English way to communicate this down to  those on the ground.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome amendment  No 1, which proposes to change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;must&rdquo;. However, a word of  warning: there is no point in having &ldquo;must&rdquo; unless the guidelines are right  or as close to being right as we can make them. We have to have a balance in  this; I will come back to that word all the way through. In Europe,  the Germans will bring in many rules that we all have to follow; the French  will bring in rules that we all have to follow but they do not; and many other  cultures are getting involved in things that are going to affect us in the  wildlife world. Our job is to get the right balance. I would like to see the  word &ldquo;must&rdquo; included, but there is a warning with that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 2 introduces a time limit of within five  years. That is vital. We do not want the Bill to be passed and then forgotten  about for 25 years. It has to be reviewed all the time &mdash; every five years at  most. The Department and all of us should learn all the time as new information  comes forward, and we should review our decisions as we progress. I welcome the  amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome amendment Nos 3, 4 and 5, which change  references to &ldquo;the Department&rdquo; in the Bill to &ldquo;a public body&rdquo;. I spoke at a  biodiversity conference in Newtownabbey, and  seven of our 26 councils have some type of biodiversity officer. However, a  whole mass of them do not have anyone who concentrates on what we are trying to  put into law, so we must work with the  councils. Again, I have a warning: public bodies must be educated to know  what we are trying to put across. I welcome the amendments, but I warn that we  may have to prioritise because of cost cuts that will be coming at us. We must  always keep it in mind that we will have to make difficult decisions as we  learn and change over five years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome and support the first group of amendments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  support all the amendments in group one. I appreciate that we have a detailed  agenda to go through in respect of this Bill, so I will keep my remarks brief,  certainly at this stage. I place on record my party&rsquo;s praise for the very close  working relationship that we have seen between the Minister and Department on  one hand and the Committee on the other in relation to the revision of the  legislation, which is very welcome. We look forward to a productive afternoon.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We welcome the further strengthening of the specific duties  in respect of biodiversity in the amendments before us. In particular, it is  important that we try to extend the statutory duty from the Department to all  public bodies. It is also important to recognise that the circumstances in  which diversity may need to be protected or may be under threat do not fall  purely within the remit of the Department of the Environment; they can emerge  in a whole host of scenarios. We must reflect that in the approach taken by the  legislation. I note that that approach is much more broadly based than the more  narrow approach in the recent forestry legislation. That was a minor flaw in  what was otherwise an excellent piece of legislation from the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development. Equally, arising from that, we welcome the  commitment to work on a cross-cutting basis on the protection of wildlife and  the natural environment. Again, that reflects the fact that this issue does not  sit in individual silos; it requires collaboration across society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Biodiversity is important, not just in flora and fauna but  in our society and our future development. I note that Mr Kinahan made remarks  about respecting traditions. It is absolutely fine to respect traditions, but  we have to acknowledge that standards and attitudes in society change. In the  twenty-first century, there is much greater acknowledgement of the importance  that wildlife provides to our society. There is a much greater interest in  protecting wildlife than in simply viewing it as a resource to be exploited.  Our attitude is much more sophisticated than the traditional attitude towards  wildlife through the ages, and I think that most people welcome that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  have no problems with the amendments. It is important that we instil in  Departments and public bodies generally the importance of the protection of  wildlife and nature conservation. It is one thing putting that on paper;  ensuring that it is implemented on the ground is totally different.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we in Northern Ireland to some extent pay  lip service to the importance of conserving our flora and fauna, the situation  on the ground is far from encouraging. Many people&rsquo;s views on the environment  in Northern Ireland  are similar to those of the man who bought a new Range Rover to take his  bottles to the recycling plant. In other words, we are quite prepared to do the  soft things. We are quite prepared to plant the trees, to do the odd bit of  litter picking and, perhaps, to do a bit of recycling. However, whenever we as  a society are asked to do something that affects our pockets, our commerce or  the urbanisation of our countryside, we are not so keen on the environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must instil the importance of our natural environment  into every level of government. Quite frankly, whenever I drive round the  countryside in Northern    Ireland, I absolutely despair about what is  happening to it and to our wildlife. For a long time, Northern Ireland  was booming. We had a house-building frenzy in urban and rural areas, we had a  major increase in our roads infrastructure, and we had a great deal of  concreting of our countryside. Nevertheless, the tide has turned to some  extent, and there have been some welcome developments, the obvious one being  the single farm payment scheme and cross-compliance. Those developments have  turned the tanker, as it were, from a situation where there was production for  production&rsquo;s sake in agriculture and everything was geared towards producing  the maximum return from our land to one where we are now giving landowners and  farmers incentives to protect the countryside. That is a good thing, and it has  stopped the massive loss of hedgerows in the Province and the drainage of our  wetlands, for example. However, an awful lot of damage was done, and it will  take many decades to restore Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s countryside to what it was in the  1950s, for example.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, we must start somewhere. Putting the onus on  government bodies to take the lead is a good thing. I welcome the fact that the  Minister has accepted the amendments. The changing of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to the  words &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and &ldquo;must&rdquo; is also a good thing. It means that whenever  Departments step out of line and do something that is clearly to the detriment  of the countryside, at least the Bill can be quoted to prove that they are not  honouring the basic tenet of faith on what we should be doing in our  countryside. Northern    Ireland has lost so much, and it is now important  that we turn that tide of destruction and start to rebuild our countryside.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have lost important species. When I was young, which was  a long time ago in the 1970s, I remember &mdash; [Interruption.] Some Members have  good memories. In fact, it was the 1960s &mdash; possibly even the 1950s. I recently  told a group of Queen&rsquo;s students that my political career had been interrupted  by the Boer war, and they said to me, &ldquo;Mr Wells, please tell us more&rdquo;. The Boer  war took place between 1896 and 1901. However, to be serious, I remember walking  to school through fields in north Armagh where  six or seven pairs of corncrakes were calling. Such events do not happen any  more, and the species is practically extinct in Northern Ireland. We have only one  nesting pair of chough left in Northern    Ireland. Species such as lapwing and  ground-wading birds such as redshank and snipe have disappeared from much of  our countryside. We have lost so much, and Northern Ireland is the poorer for  it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I welcome the fact that the Minister has, on  this occasion, decided to beef up, as it were, the legislation to compel  Departments to do better. I will speak at much greater length on the other  clauses and amendments. The Minister will find that there is unanimity in the  House on the matter and that we are sending out a clear signal as to where  government agencies and public bodies should be going in the future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  Like other Members, I thank the Minister for responding to the issues that the  Committee raised. The Wildlife and Natural Environment Bill is important  legislation, and we can all support it. However, on a previous occasion, I  raised the fundamental issue of policing and enforcement, and I am still  concerned about that. It is all right having the legislation, but I am  concerned as to whether it can be enforced and policed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will talk about amendment Nos 1 to 5.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my speech at Second Stage, I called for a tightening of  the legislation on biodiversity, and the Minister responded quite well to that.  The change from the Department &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;must&rdquo; in amendment No 1 is a  fundamental change. Doing nothing has now been ruled out, and that is a major  improvement. I also asked that there be a progress report on the implementation  of Department&rsquo;s biodiversity strategy every three years. However, amendment No  2, which calls for that report to be published every five years, is acceptable.  Amendment Nos 3, 4, and 5, which extend the biodiversity duty to other public  bodies, also represent fundamental changes. Therefore, there has been a  significant tightening of the legislation in respect of biodiversity, which I  support.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Most of the points on the  amendments to the biodiversity duties of the Bill have been made for me by  other Members, and I agree with much of what has been said. However,  biodiversity is, in a sense, a movable feast. Jim Wells mentioned the change in  biodiversity that has occurred over many years, yet no one has been able to  confirm what caused that change among our birdlife, our flora and fauna.  However, a tightening of biodiversity duties will happen regardless.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Farmers currently undertake cross-compliance and it is  debatable whether that will continue if the single farm payment is  discontinued. Indeed, it is possible that there will be a reversion to  practices in farming which may not protect species. Farmers have management  agreements in those areas, and, although the Government does not actually own  the land, in some instances farmers would say that they may as well because  they have so little control over it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Species including the curlew, the corncrake and many others  have disappeared from Fermanagh and elsewhere. However, elements outside of  this country may be responsible for that, rather than any practices that have  been undertaken here. Crom Estate in Fermanagh is an ASSI. Indeed, almost all  of County Fermanagh is protected in that way, and  what Members are being asked to support in the Bill will mean that people will  not even be able to walk in protected areas. However, there is one area in Crom  Estate in which protected flora species have disappeared, despite the area  having been fenced off and not farmed. It is all down to research and  follow-up, but I agree with much of what has been said.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Most Members seem to be in almost complete agreement with  the proposals on biodiversity; therefore, I do not intend to prolong this part  of the debate. However, there may be more vociferous debate when the next group  of amendments is debated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Without the legislation, there cannot be enforcement of  environmental protection, and we must put the horse before the cart. Developing  the role that public bodies have in addressing biodiversity challenges and  ensuring that those are met is a good thing. The Bill also sets out greater  enforcement measures, including custodial sentencing, which did not previously  exist, and it is important that those who prosecute environmental crime have  the power to impose custodial sentences as well as fines. The Bill will also  provide the PSNI with greater powers to collect evidence and serve conviction  notices.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister of the Environment</span>:  We oppose the amendments that have been tabled by the Chairperson of the  Committee for the Environment to give protection to the golden plover and to  remove three species of birds from schedule 4 of the Wildlife (Northern Ireland)  Order 1985. We also oppose amendment No 37 to give the Irish hare full  protection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 4 introduces new all-year-round protection for the  nests of certain birds that habitually use the same nest year after year, as  their loss could seriously affect the breeding success of such birds. The  Committee for the Environment considered  that that protection should be extended to other species of bird: the  white-tailed eagle, the osprey, the peregrine, the barn owl and the red kite,  which, in the past two years, has been subject to a reintroduction programme in  Northern Ireland.  I fully agree with the Committee&rsquo;s recommendation, and amendment No 6 adds  those species to the new schedule that is provided by clause 4(3).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 9 introduces new protection for basking sharks from  intentional or reckless disturbance. Due to their ecology, basking sharks do  not have a normal resting place or place of shelter, hence the new protection.  The Committee for the Environment recommended that such protection should also  be afforded to seals, particularly when they are away from land. I fully agree  with that recommendation, and amendment No 7 expands that protection to the two  species of seal that are found in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 25 concerns powers to make special protection  orders to protect wildfowl during periods of extreme weather. As Members will  be aware, the past winter in Northern    Ireland was the most severe since the early  1960s. As a consequence, my Department issued a severe weather order made under  powers contained in the Wildlife Order. The severe weather order is designed to  protect all birds that rely on wetland habitats, such as wildfowl and wading  birds. Due to a legal technicality, it is not possible to include two important  species of waders, namely woodcock and snipe. They are game species protected under  separate game laws, which do not contain any provision for making severe  weather orders. It is important that all species of wading birds can obtain  protection during periods of extreme weather. Therefore, I propose to amend  extant game laws to allow such protection. That essentially means replicating  existing powers contained in the Wildlife Order within the game laws.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 45 and 48 are also concerned with severe  weather orders. There is a requirement on the Department to consult district  councils affected by those orders prior to making them. By their nature, the  orders need to be made urgently in severe weather conditions, and there is  simply not enough time for the Department to meet its obligation to consult.  The amendment, therefore, removes that obligation. The requirement to consult  shooting interests will continue to apply as it is an integral part of the  protocol for agreeing to the need to make severe weather orders.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 25 also amends section 7C(1) of the Game  Preservation Act 1928. That section gives me, as Minister, the power to issue  special protection orders on any game species for a period not exceeding one  year. Such orders can prohibit the taking, killing, sale or purchase of any  game specified in such an order. The Environment Committee recommended that  such orders should be augmented to make possession an offence. I am content to  accept that recommendation and to propose the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 27 to 34 concern changes to schedule 1 to the  Wildlife Order. The Environment Committee has recommended adding a number of  species of bird to schedule 1 to the Wildlife Order. Those include the curlew,  lapwing, redshank and whinchat. The curlew is currently listed on schedule 2 to  the Wildlife Order, which is commonly known as the quarry list, and can be  hunted. Adding it to schedule 1 to the Wildlife Order will remove it from the  quarry list.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have been aware of competing arguments from relevant  interests about the future status of that species. Having considered the conservation  pressures on the species, I have concluded that greater protection is required.  Therefore, I agree with the Committee&rsquo;s recommendation to support protection  for the four species that I have mentioned, which are amendment Nos 27, 28, 30  and 31. As a consequence, the curlew should be removed from schedule 2 to the  Wildlife Order, which is amendment No 33.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 29, 32 and 34, which were tabled by the  Chairperson of the Environment Committee, call for the removal of the golden  plover from the quarry list. I oppose those amendments, as available evidence  from between the 1980s and 2008 indicates little overall change in the  wintering population of golden plover. The evidence indicates a stable  wintering population of golden plover in Northern Ireland, with more than  21,000 birds counted in the 2008 peak month. I understand that, on average,  over 10 years, the British Association for Shooting and Conservation membership  recorded a bag of golden plover of 12 birds each winter. Such a low take cannot  negatively impact the population and would be clearly sustainable. Removal from  the quarry list is, therefore, not required for the conservation of the species  at this time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill proposes to make a number of additions to schedule  4 to the Wildlife Order. Schedule 4 lists those species of birds that people  are permitted to possess for avicultural purposes under licence issued by DOE.  Such birds have been bred in captivity and ringed with an authorised form of  ring. The Environment Committee cited reports of illegal imports into the UK of wild  birds from the continent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Committee was concerned that the addition of  more birds could pose a risk to the wild bird population in Northern Ireland.  Subsequently, the Chairperson tabled amendment No 36 to remove three species  from the extant schedule 4; reed bunting, twite and yellowhammer.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although there is no evidence of any illegal activity in  Northern Ireland, I initially decided not to pursue the proposed additions, but  to maintain the status quo with regard to the list of birds that people can  possess legally; hence amendment No 35. I am conscious that anyone who  possesses any of those birds under the existing schedule is subject to regular  monitoring by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency. To date, there have not  been any problems concerning non-compliance with conditions of licences. I have  given further consideration to the matter and have decided not to pursue my  initial amendment because there is clearly very limited risk to the wild bird  population in Northern    Ireland. I will, therefore, not move  amendment No 35. For that reason, I will oppose amendment No 36, which has been  tabled by the Committee Chairperson.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 37 proposes to give full statutory protection  to the Irish hare by placing it on schedule 5 to the Wildlife (Northern Ireland)  Order 1985. Ecological evidence indicates that the main factors that limit the  Irish hare population are availability and quality of suitable habitat.  Activities such as hunting have negligible impact on the overall population.  Ten years ago, the Irish hare population was one hare per square kilometre. My  Department developed a species action plan to address conservation concerns.  That plan included two key targets that related to the overall population,  including a target to double the population in as wide an area as possible over  a 10-year period.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Data from the annual survey show that targets that are  contained in the action plan have been achieved. Research also shows that there  has been no regression of the population&rsquo;s genetic strength. Therefore, my  Department considers the Irish hare population stable. On that basis, I do not  believe that it is necessary to give it full statutory protection. My  Department will conduct a review of the current action plan with a view to  developing a new plan that will aim to continue to focus on the key actions  that will help to maintain the population that we have achieved throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr Ford</span>: Will the Minister  give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister of the Environment</span>:  With the help of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development&rsquo;s schemes  and other projects, my Department aims to improve those numbers over the next  10 years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We will engage in debate, during which other Members can  make their cases. I will be quite happy to give way during my winding-up speech  if that is required.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At present, therefore, I am not prepared to support  amendment No 37.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr Ford</span>: Will the Minister  give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister of the Environment</span>:  As I explained, I am not happy to give way now. However, I will give way during  my winding-up speech at the end of the debate. People will have an opportunity  to make their cases, as opposed to starting debate at this point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 38 is a technical amendment that relates to  protection for the common skate. As a commercially exploited species, the  common skate falls under the scope of the EU common fisheries policy, which  applies in the region of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s territorial waters beyond six  miles. It is, therefore, permissible to afford protection under the ambit of  the Wildlife Order only within the six-mile limit.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 39 and 40 relate to the proposal to add two  species of deer to schedule 9 to the Wildlife Order. It is an offence for  anyone to release or to allow to escape into the wild any species that is  listed in schedule 9. Chinese water deer and roe deer are highly invasive  species. If they become established in Northern Ireland, significant  damage will be caused to agricultural interests and biodiversity. I agree with  the Committee for the Environment that those species should be added to  schedule 9 to the Wildlife Order.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 41 is a technical amendment that has been  agreed by the Committee and intends to clarify in scientific terms the specific  species of knotweed that should be listed in schedule 9 to the Wildlife Order.  That schedule lists highly invasive non-native species.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 42 arises as a consequence of that which was  tabled by members to give the Irish hare, a game species, full statutory  protection under the Wildlife Order. Although I do not support the amendment to  add the Irish hare to schedule 5 to the Wildlife Order at this time, that  amendment will facilitate consistency between game laws and future wildlife  Orders in the event that the Irish hare is ever given full protection.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Chairperson of the Committee  for the Environment</span>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. On  behalf of the Committee, I welcome amendment No 6 to clause 4, which, as we  heard, introduces new statutory protection for the nests of particular birds  all year round. The Bill listed only the golden eagle, but various specialist  groups advised the Committee that the list should be extended to include other  species found in the North that also return to their nests year on year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Consequently, the Committee recommended that the red kite,  the osprey, the peregrine and the barn owl be added to the list. Amendment No 6  provides that recommendation. There was some debate about the extent to which  the barn owl can be considered in this category as being nest loyal. Unlike the  other species to which I referred, which consistently return to and use the  same site year after year, the barn owl might appear to be a little less  consistent. However, evidence presented to the Committee suggested that,  although barn owls elsewhere have demonstrated flexibility in their choice of  nesting sites, their pattern in the North is more rigid. Consequently, the  Committee felt that the vulnerable population of barn owls would benefit from  inclusion on the list.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 7 is also welcomed by the Committee. It adds  to clause 9 the two species of seal that are found in the seas around the  North. Clause 9, as drafted, creates a new offence for anyone intentionally or  recklessly disturbing basking sharks. The Committee supported greater  protection for basking sharks but, picking up on advice from several specialist  groups, recommended that the protection should be extended to seals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I move now to amendment No 25. The Department advised the  Committee that, as a result of difficulties encountered during last winter&rsquo;s prolonged  cold spell, it would be making amend&shy;ments to the Bill that would allow the  process of protecting wading birds to take place more easily when necessary.  That was accepted, in principle, by the Committee, so I am happy to accept, on  the Committee&rsquo;s behalf, the part of amendment No 25 and the technical amendment  to schedule 2 provided by amendment Nos 45 and 48 that address that. More  important to the Committee, however, was the need to close what it perceived to  be a loophole in special protection orders that allowed a person to be in  possession of a game species when its killing and taking were temporarily  banned by an order. On behalf of the Committee, therefore, I welcome the  inclusion of the word &ldquo;possession&rdquo; to special protection orders that will be  introduced by amendment No 25.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I move now to amendment No 27, which amends schedule 1. It  is true to say that that area exercised most of the Committee&rsquo;s time while it  was scrutinising the Bill. It became apparent early in the Committee&rsquo;s  deliberations that there was a need for greater protection of the curlew. The  bird is currently on the quarry list, which is the list of birds in the  Wildlife Order 1985 that may be killed or taken. Many organisations that  provided evidence to the Committee called for it to be given greater protection  to allow its population to recover. The Committee recommended that not only  should the curlew be removed from the quarry list but that it should be added  to the list of birds that are protected at all times in the 1985 Order. That  will be achieved by amendment Nos 27 and 33, which are welcomed by the  Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the basis of evidence of declining populations, the  Committee also recommended the addition of the lapwing, the redshank and the  whinchat to the list of birds that are protected at all times, and I am pleased  to welcome amendment Nos 28, 30 and 31, which will deliver that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I move now to the fifth bird in that set. As was the case  with the species that I just mentioned, the Committee was advised by experts  that the population of the golden plover was also struggling in the North and  that its ongoing inclusion on the list of game birds should be reviewed. The  Committee sought additional information from the Department, which suggested that,  although the population of the golden plover is low in the North, it is stable.  The Department told the Committee that it would be monitoring the golden plover  populations closely and reviewing its status in five years&rsquo; time. However, the  Committee noted that golden plover numbers in England were on the increase and  that, to give it a better chance in the North, it would be more sensible to  afford greater protection to the bird now and to review the situation in five  years&rsquo; time, reinstating it as a game species if its population is healthier. With  that approach in mind, the Committee tabled amendment No 29, which will add the  golden plover to the list of birds that are protected at all times, and  amendment No 34, which will take it off the list of birds that may be taken or  killed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 32 removes the golden plover from the list  that allows it to be subject to a closed period, as that would become a redundant  requirement if that bird were to be given full protection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will move on to amendment Nos 35 and 36. The Bill  proposes that an additional 16 species of wild bird be added to the list in the  Wildlife Order of birds that can be kept in captivity and shown for competitive  purposes. Expert groups that gave evidence to the Committee argued that the  appropriate research needed to be carried out and that proper cases needed to  be made before any more species are added to that list. They argued that it was  not sufficient to look at the lists used in other regions and copy them here.  The expert groups also said that there is evidence that keeping captive collections  for showing encourages the illegal trafficking of those species in the wild,  particularly on the European mainland, and that species with vulnerable  populations should be excluded.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Stakeholders were particularly concerned about the pressure  that would be placed on the twite, reed bunting and yellowhammer, which are  among the most vulnerable species in the North today. Those three species are  on the list of wild birds that can be kept in captivity. Departmental officials  defended the addition of the 16 species, and those on the existing list in the  Wildlife Order, by suggesting that the licensing system in the North was much  tighter than in other regions. For example, one third of licence holders here  are inspected annually. Nonetheless, the Committee felt that it was appropriate  for the three most vulnerable species to be removed from the existing list and  that no additional species should be added.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 35, which was tabled by the Minister, would go  some way towards the Committee&rsquo;s position by preventing the addition of 16 new  species to the list. The Committee is pleased that its concerns have been  recognised in part. However, as amendment No 35 does not remove any species  from the list, the Committee has tabled amendment No 36, which will prevent the  addition of 16 new species and remove the twite, reed bunting and yellowhammer  from the list.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is silent on the Irish hare. However, no one could  accuse the Committee of being silent on it, nor the many organisations that lobbied us during Committee Stage: each was as  determined as the other that its position was the correct one. Members  considered at length the evidence put before them, which ranged from those who  were adamant that the Irish hare should be afforded greater protection to those  who provided scientific evidence that Irish hare populations thrive where  sporting activities involving the Irish hare are traditional.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Departmental officials advised the Committee that the  greatest threat to the Irish hare was loss of habitat and that an Irish hare  species action plan to address that situation had doubled the population over  recent years. However, the officials also noted that obtaining accurate and  consistent data on the Irish hare was difficult. They advised the Committee  that the Department has recourse to special protection orders to protect the  Irish hare when populations become critical and that it has used that method  satisfactorily to date. On balance, therefore, the Committee agreed that the  Irish hare should remain on the list of game species, with temporary special protection  orders being introduced when numbers decline. That position is in keeping with  the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was going to read out two or three more pages of comments  in favour of the Committee&rsquo;s position on the Irish hare. However, as the  Minister intends to oppose amendment No 37, I will not continue that debate.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyText">1. <span class="BoldText">Miss McIlveen</span> asked the  Minister for Social Development for his assessment of the recommendations made  in the May 2010 report by the independent Commission on the Future for Housing  in Northern Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 1468/10<a name="AQO1468/10" id="AQO1468/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development &nbsp;(Mr Attwood)</strong>: I  thank the Member for her question. The report is a weighty one, with 140  recommendations. The Department and I are making an assessment of those  recommendations. I trust that the quality measures up to the quantity. Some  very early conclusions can be drawn. The first and most fundamental is that the  report says what everybody with any insight into this matter confirms: housing  needs to be put on a secure financial basis. The hand-to-mouth existence from  CSR to CSR, year to year, or from one monitoring return to another, is not the  way to make the best plans for a service as essential as housing in the North.  I welcome that recommendation, and I look forward to sharing with the House my  and the Department&rsquo;s views in due course.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. The commission report contains a chapter  on how the good work of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive can be improved  on. How does the Minister plan to take forward any reform of the Housing  Executive?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister for Social Development: Without prejudice  to the commission&rsquo;s recommendations, a review of the Housing Executive will be  launched in the near future. As I have said before, I do not intend that to be  a light-touch review. It will, without prejudice, look at some matters that the  commission has raised, including the future of the Housing Executive in respect  of its strategic role and its landlord role.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the House will take forward work on some areas  on which the report is somewhat silent, including the need to deepen a shared  future generally in our society, and particularly in respect of housing.  Although there is no doubt that the report makes some useful recommendations,  it is light on some essential challenges that face our society and housing. I  will not shirk issues around the future of the Housing Executive, but I will  make sure that we build on the best of the work of the Housing Executive, which  has so well served communities in the North over the past 40 years.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  What is the Minister&rsquo;s assessment of the commission&rsquo;s proposal on shared future  housing?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: As I indicated, the commission was somewhat light in  what it said about a shared future and shared future housing. As the House  knows, my predecessor put in place mechanisms not only to try to build shared  housing estates but to develop shared housing neighbourhoods. A number of weeks  ago, I had the pleasure of travelling on a steam train in Coleraine with people  from shared housing neighbourhoods whose aim was to demonstrate what could be  done in that regard. The Deputy Speaker will be particularly aware of that  matter. I hope to launch 14 more shared housing neighbourhoods in the near  future to build on the 16 that my colleague Margaret Ritchie introduced.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The report discusses how housing functions could be transferred to local  councils following the review of public administration (RPA) process. Given the  failure to implement that reform, will the Minister outline his plans for the  relationship with the existing 26 councils, which are destined to continue?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: It would be a brave man who would jump in on that  particular question, given the disappointment last week in respect of local  government reorganisation. At the Executive, I, on behalf of my party, voted in  favour of reorganisation. Whatever the difficulties or hurdles, my party&rsquo;s view  is that we could have got over that in the next year. It is a disappointment  and, perhaps, a negative reflection on government over the past number of years  that that matter was not captured. I have arranged to meet my officials to see  whether there are any matters that we can rightly take forward, either now or  in the short term, in respect of devolving responsibilities to local councils.  As I said, I am not going to prejudge that debate, given the situation that now  transpires. I am certainly not going to prejudge it in a situation in which, as  we learned in the past number of hours, further budgetary pressures are being  planned for the devolved arrangements through the London Exchequer Budget. I  hear what the Member is saying. I am going to discuss it, and will come back to  the House and the Committee if I think that that is appropriate, but for the  moment, I am going to keep my powder dry.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. My question is about the block  leasing of housing units from the private sector and the wider use of the  private-rented sector in the provision of social housing. Will the Minister  tell us whether the recommendations made in the report will be considered ahead  of the introduction of a mandatory regulation scheme and firm controls of the  unregulated sector, which receives upwards of &pound;85 million of public money a  year?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the member for his question. As he is no doubt  aware, legislation was tabled in the House this morning to take forward a  number of matters, particularly about the private-rented sector. Therefore, I  think that it is best, in the first instance, to legislate for the matters that  are outlined in that legislation in respect of the private-rented sector. If  other matters about the private-rented sector arise from the report, which, as  I said, we have yet to draw conclusions on, I will come back to the House and  consider those. However, at this stage, I do not have any particular plans to  enhance the legislation that I tabled this morning and that the House will  consider in due course.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make one  thing about block leasing very clear: although there are issues involving  the Housing Executive that we need to have a full conversation about, without  prejudice to how that ends up, I am not going down the road of privatising  housing stock in the North. The Housing Executive is responsible for 90,000  properties. Whatever way we may refinance and remodel in the future, it will  not involve going down the road of the privatisation of stock transfer or any  variation of that model. It is curious that one thing the commission did  recommend was not to go there, and I have some sympathy in that regard.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading"><strong>Housing  Associations</strong>: Off-the-shelf Purchases</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">2. <span class="BoldText">Mr Hamilton</span> asked the  Minister for Social Development what process is in place to ensure that  residents in housing developments are consulted when housing associations propose  to purchase properties &lsquo;off the shelf&rsquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  1469/10<a name="AQO1469/10" id="AQO1469/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. It is the case  that there is no statutory obligation on any housing association to consult  with homeowners prior to purchasing off-the-shelf properties. Without wishing  to pre-empt Mr Hamilton&rsquo;s supplementary question, I think that it is good  practice that, when a housing association is going to make an off-the-shelf  purchase, there is appropriate consultation with other relevant parties,  including those living in the neighbourhood, those living in the development  and homeowners.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. He is aware of a case in Newtownards  where concerns have been expressed by existing homeowners about the lack of  consultation in respect of off-the-shelf purchases in their development. Will  the Minister ensure that the housing association guide is reviewed with a view  to amending it to ensure that that proper consultation is there in the future?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am pleased to give that reassurance. I confirmed with  officials only this morning that that will be built into the housing  association guidelines, and I went further and suggested to officials that they  advise housing associations, when purchasing properties off the shelf, to ask  landowners&rsquo; lawyers to share with them title deeds and leaseholds for  neighbouring properties that may or may not have some influence on the lands  that they intend to buy.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. In the past number of years, I  have been told by a number of housing associations that, when they are  purchasing housing units, either off the shelf or on the open market, they then  have to spend between &pound;8,000 and &pound;10,000 to bring them up to the high standard  set by housing associations. Does the Minister believe that that is good value  for money?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I trust that the Member agrees that social sector  housing should meet certain standards and that we should not cut corners in  meeting them. That is laid down in the various guidelines and regulations that  govern what housing associations do. Therefore, it is fair and reasonable that  housing associations should be required either to enhance their properties in  order to bring them up to the standard that Housing Executive tenants enjoy or  to build properties that meet that standard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the Member can point to cases in which housing  associations have been unfairly requested to upgrade, I am prepared to look at  them. The evidence may or may not exist. On average, it costs &pound;81,795 to buy a  house off the shelf, but it costs housing associations around &pound;14,000 more to  build one. I am in favour of housing associations building houses, and it is my  very strong preference that that is prioritised. I am not into reconfiguring  housing association properties in favour of buying off the shelf. However, at  the moment, the evidence suggests that buying off the shelf is the cheaper  option even though it may not necessarily be the better one.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Will the Minister set out his Department&rsquo;s policy on the purchase of  off-the-shelf housing as part of its social housing development plan?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: As I indicated in my previous answer, there will be  occasions when off-the-shelf purchases will enable access to social housing  quicker than might otherwise be the case, and I will not close off that option.  Two thirds of the properties that came on in the last year were housing  association newbuilds and one third was off-the-shelf purchases. I do not want  to see that balance changed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I say, I wish to see the situation in which housing  associations build more houses rather than having to buy more houses off the  shelf. However, there will be circumstances where that is appropriate. To go  back to what Mr McCann said, there are circumstances where that option works  well. For example, Clanmil Housing Association&rsquo;s Causeway Meadows development  in Lisburn recently won an award for the quality of the housing that it  provides. That development provides housing to people from a diverse mix of  community, social and economic backgrounds.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Lower Falls:  Regeneration</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">3. <span class="BoldText">Mr Adams</span> asked the Minister  for Social Development how his Department can provide &lsquo;early wins&rsquo; in the lower  Falls area of West Belfast to support urban regeneration and community  development and ensure social improvement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  1470/10<a name="AQO1470/10" id="AQO1470/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister for Social Development: I thank Mr Adams  for his question. I had a useful conversation with him last week, and I look  forward to having many other useful conversations with MLAs about the profile  of projects that my Department is taking forward. I make it clear to the House  that I will judge myself &mdash; and everyone in the House, be they MLAs or  Ministers, should judge themselves &mdash; on not only what I can do to provide quick  wins for any one constituency, but what I can do to deliver month in and year  in for communities, especially those in need. In making that point, I am  mindful of this morning&rsquo;s developments in Westminster  in respect of the Chancellor&rsquo;s proposals. Devolution must be seen to work fully  in areas of need, such as West Belfast and the lower Falls in particular, given  that it has stalled and stumbled by common consent at various times over the  past number of years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My predecessor set out a vision for the development of the  lower Falls. A consultation on the master plan took place between October 2009  and March 2010. Opportunities exist to make early progress on the redevelopment  of St Colmgall&rsquo;s, Dunville park and public realms on some of the main roads  going through West Belfast.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me make it clear that those urban regeneration  projects, and many more besides, are all subject to money coming back to my  Department from the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) under the  quarterly monitoring returns now and during the year. If significant funds do  not come back, worthwhile projects on the lower Falls, and in many other parts  of the North, will be strangled.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: I remind Members that if they ask a  question in another language, they must translate it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Adams: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  I am glad of the opportunity to wish the Minister well, and I thank him for our  meeting last week, which was wide-ranging and positive. However, at that  meeting, he declined to give a clear answer on the demolition and replacement  of the Ross Street  flats. Will the Minister confirm today that his Department has, since February  2009, been in possession of an economic appraisal report that recommends the  demolition and replacement of those flats? Does he agree that to alleviate the  negative social impact on the people of the Falls who want those flats to be  demolished, the time has come to act on that recommendation?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Mr Adams for his question and for the tone of  our meeting last week. I answered his question then, and I am prepared to share  my response with the House. When my predecessor made a decision on the flats,  housing waiting lists in the lower Falls were more acute than they are now.  There have been changes since then: 166 houses are being built on the Bass  brewery site, a project that Margaret Ritchie brought to fruition some weeks  ago; the Fold Housing Association is about to bring housing to the lower Falls;  and, over the past 12 months, the number of people on the housing transfer list  has declined by 32. Given all those changes, there is an evidence base for my reconsideration  of the matter. As I said to Mr Adams and to the &lsquo;Andersonstown News&rsquo;, I rule  nothing in and nothing out when it comes to that matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Various economic appraisals go through Departments, but  everybody must be mindful that they must also be agreed by DFP. Therefore,  although I rule nothing in and nothing out, I hope that, if the matter is  brought forward, it will be agreed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know, as do Mr Adams, Mr McCann and all the  representatives of West Belfast, that the area  has multidimensional difficulties. Although it is important to resolve the housing  issue, the resolution of all the other matters is what will create a better  community fabric and ensure that those who are antisocial or threaten the  stability of the area receive no encouragement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  The Minister will be aware of two significant ongoing urban regeneration  schemes in Coleraine, which, over the past few years, have been progressed with  the assistance of his Department. Will he ensure that every possible assistance  continues to be given to private sector developers to ensure that developments  such as those can be brought to a successful conclusion?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I may have to come back to the Member on that  particular matter, as I am not fully aware of the details. However, I am due to  go to Coleraine in the near future to see one of those schemes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I strongly believe that the money invested in urban  regeneration and renewal leverages private moneys &mdash; as can be seen in various  parts of the North. That, in turn, leads not only to short-term job creation  through the associated schemes but to more long-term sustainable development  because people begin to create businesses in those areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a great example of that in Belfast. Some businessmen, one of whom was  local, saw the ongoing public realm initiatives on Ann Street, which was widely viewed as  being in some decline. The businessmen recognised that, as a consequence of  those initiatives, there would be an uplift in that area. They invested in  opening businesses in the area, including a pizza parlour, and Ann Street is now  on the up. That is an example of when money that was invested by my Department  leveraged private moneys, which have, in turn, created a better environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I can see the same thing happening in Larne, Carrickfergus,  Dungannon and Coleraine. However, it can happen only if my Department has money  to invest in projects that will create town centre renewal and business  opportunities and encourage private investment. If that money is cut off at the  source by DFP &mdash; I trust that that will not happen, but it could do &mdash; those are the  types of projects that will be cut off in the local communities that we all  represent in the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I am sure that the Minister will agree that it is important for west Belfast to have a  champion at the Executive table. What progress is being made in the upper Falls  area of west Belfast  in community development and urban regeneration?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I hope that every  member of the Executive is the champion for any area of disadvantage in the  North, because, if devolution is to measure up, it must do so for those  communities. I hope to see all my Executive colleagues live up to that  responsibility over the next number of days.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are many initiatives in west Belfast, many of which were taken forward by  my predecessor, Margaret Ritchie. I hope to make announcements shortly on those  initiatives. In particular, I met officials and others this morning to discuss  taking forward the Glen 10 or Glen 11 proposal. As I indicated to Mr Adams last  week, that situation is maturing to the point where an announcement can and  shall be made in the very near future. As a consequence of that, an area of  west Belfast  will have a coherent and cohesive plan, not just for housing but for the full  range of public services. That plan will be for an area of land that is bigger  than the Titanic Quarter and is one of the biggest single development sites in Northern Ireland.  That will happen because, in November last year, Margaret Ritchie took the  initiative and created a steering group. That steering group is now developing  proposals, which may become more fully fledged over the course of this calendar  year. That is a measure of what she achieved, and it is a measure of what can  be done in west Belfast.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Mortgage Relief</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">4. <span class="BoldText">Mr Butler</span> asked the Minister  for Social Development if he is now ready to proceed with an effective mortgage  relief package to ensure that people do not lose their homes due to the collapse  of the housing market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 1471/10<a name="AQO1471/10" id="AQO1471/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. As the Member will  be aware, six times in the past nine monitoring returns, we &mdash; I in the most  recent one, and Margaret Ritchie in the previous eight &mdash; made bids for a  full-blooded mortgage rescue scheme. Without prejudging the outcome of the  current monitoring return, I point out that, in eight of the nine monitoring  rounds to date, the bid for &pound;5 million that was put forward in five of those rounds  was denied. Therefore, although my Department has done good work in respect of  the mortgage and debt advice service, we have not been given the moneys for a  full-blooded mortgage rescue scheme. I make that point mindful of the fact that  the Scottish Parliament recently invested &pound;20 million in a similar scheme  because of that scheme&rsquo;s success. Therefore, although we are doing good work to  help people who are in mortgage debt, further intensive measures that we could  take with a mortgage rescue scheme have been frustrated.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  answer. Does he agree that this is the only part of these islands that does not  have a mortgage rescue scheme? It is still a matter of dissatisfaction that  there is not an evaluation report forthcoming from his Department. We agree  that there should be a more strategic approach to offering, for example,  greater flexible tenure, which would help to reduce people&rsquo;s mortgages. In the  Minister&rsquo;s housing strategy document, there should be explicit proposals about  a mortgage rescue scheme. That could move the situation on much better.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. There is a simple  answer and a simple remedy to the first part of his question, which is that,  when the Executive meet this Thursday, all Ministers endorse my bid for &pound;5  million for a mortgage rescue scheme. If we are the only part of Britain and Northern Ireland that does not have  such a scheme, we can rectify that within three days. So, there is a quick and  simple but very effective remedy to the issue raised in the Member&rsquo;s first  question.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member may be a  little confused about the evaluation: the evaluation is of the mortgage  debt advice service that was launched in May 2009. The evaluation is due, and I  will be pleased to share its conclusions. I have no doubt, however, that they  will be positive, because the service has helped 755 people and directly  prevented homelessness in 10% of those cases. Therefore, I have no doubt that  the evaluation of that part of my business will be positive, and if the service  is required, and I have no doubt that it will be, we will take it forward. With  regard to a more interventionist scheme, however, Thursday will tell the tale.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for that response. The Minister spoke about the 175 people  whom his Department helped. That is good news and a clear example of what can  be done. Will the Minister tell the Assembly what success he has had with building  societies and banks directly, and with his officials, to ensure that more can  be done to build upon those 175 cases? Will he also tell us whether those 175  people are from all parts of the Province or from one specific part?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The debt advice scheme was accessed not by 175 clients  but by 755, 73 of whom, or about 10%, avoided homelessness. Many of those cases  were at the doors of the court. If those whose properties are at risk act  quickly &mdash; or at least act &mdash; it may help them, even as they are walking into the  Chancery Court in Belfast. I do not have the figures for the spread of those  who had assistance. Many of them might have had assistance in Belfast, in and around the Chancery Court or  the Housing Rights Service, which provides that service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As for dealing directly with the banks, I think that that  is being taken forward by my Executive colleague Arlene Foster on the  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment side. I will come back with  further details on that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  In answer to the original question, the Minister spoke about the number of bids  that he had made. Has he had the opportunity to discuss with the Minister of  Finance and Personnel the detail of those bids in order to enhance the  opportunity that he may have for funding a mortgage relief scheme? Does he  think that moves to charge rates on empty homes will improve the availability  of property in the market?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. By pure  coincidence I had reason to walk down the corridor on the first floor this  morning to try to speak to Mr Wilson about June monitoring returns, and, in  relation to that, about the bid for &pound;5 million in the June returns. Thus far, I  have not had the opportunity to have a whisper in Mr Wilson&rsquo;s ear. When I do,  that will be one of two issues in particular on which I will press him.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to charging rates on empty homes, my colleague  Mr McDevitt raised a number of issues on rating policy in the Budget Bill  debate yesterday. Much of what was announced in London earlier today about what will happen  to child benefits, cutting back on social security payments, and what will  happen between now and 2013 on incapacity benefit appears to me to be old Tory  policies being delivered by a coalition of grey suits. Therefore, when I speak  to Executive colleagues in the next couple of weeks on how we respond to the  Budget and the next comprehensive spending review and how we protect the  vulnerable, the Member&rsquo;s question about rating policy generally, and about  rating empty homes in particular, needs to be addressed.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="i"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Wildlife and Natural Environment Bill: Consideration  Stage</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on amendment No 6.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I turn to amendment No 38, which makes provision regarding  the protection of the common skate. The conditions, which confine protection to  coastal waters only, were already in place with respect to the angel shark, and  members sought an explanation for that from the Department. On being advised  that the angel shark and the common skate cannot be protected beyond six  nautical miles &mdash; or coastal waters &mdash; due to EU common fisheries policy, the  Committee accepted the amendment and agreed the schedule subject to that  change. That is not to say that members necessarily agreed with the reasoning,  but that is for another debate, another time and another Committee.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 39 and 40 add the Chinese water deer and roe deer  to the list of animal species that must not be released or allowed into the  wild, and amendment No 41 specifies the three species of knotweed that are to  be added to list of alien plant species. The Committee was advised that the  Department would table those amendments and agreed the schedule accordingly.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In an increasingly globalised world and free markets,  defending this island from alien species is becoming a difficult and expensive  battle. Preventing them from getting into the wild in the first place is much  the wiser option. However, I take this opportunity to note again the benefits  of looking to best practice elsewhere, particularly with regard to non-native  species. Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  This is particularly well timed. As a member of the Environment Committee, I  say that it is rare in this House to come across a Bill with this level of  detail. There is much that is important in it. No one in the Environment  Committee has a panoply of expertise in this subject, and it has been difficult  to wade through a lot of the issues because of that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is also undoubtedly the case that there is controversy  on a range of issues. There are passionately-held views on both sides of the  matters before us, which have clearly been reflected in the points raised by  various members of the public in connection with the Bill. Our aim is to strike  a balance and provide a degree of protection for a range of species.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">On a number of issues, there has been a divergence between  what has eventually emerged as the Committee&rsquo;s position and that of the  Minister. The Minister and the Department have made a clear-cut attempt to  accommodate some of the Committee&rsquo;s concerns. Consequently, a number of changes  have been universally welcomed and have been taken on board by the Department.  In this group of amendments, the House can unite on amendment Nos 6 and 7,  which refer to the inclusion of the lapwing and the redshank, not to mention  the winchat and the references to Chinese water deer and roe deer and the other  provisions, which have been welcomed.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Reference has been made to amendment Nos 35 and 36. I have  spoken to Mr I McCrea about those, and he will be speaking about them in  greater detail later. Although it has been identified as a particular problem,  I think it was highlighted by the Chairperson of the Committee that it is more  of a European problem. We should not look to inflict on local people some  problems that are not particularly pertinent to Northern Ireland. Consequently, I  agree with the Minister. This is a delicate issue. The Minister has changed his  position on amendment Nos 35 and 36 and he does not support the Committee&rsquo;s  recommendation, which is the sensible course of action.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We received conflicting advice, as happens with many  issues, about the golden plover. I will be interested to hear further comments  about that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I commend the fact that the British Association for  Shooting and Conservation (BASC) made a strenuous and serious effort to try to  reach a voluntary agreement not to shoot curlew. Had that been universally  accepted, there would have been less of an argument for removing it from the  quarry list because the curlew is under threat. Unfortunately, one club refused  to sign up to that, and a voluntary moratorium on the curlew could be effective  only if it was universal. I think, therefore, that the provision on the curlew  is wise.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Some long-standing members of the Committee mentioned the  Irish hare, and, as the Chairperson said, there is no direct recommendation  from the Committee on that issue. However, beyond this Bill, there has been  considerable debate on the Irish hare down the years. I have concerns about  some of the figures that the Committee received. Each time that there has been  a renewal of special protection status for the Irish hare, I have been a little  unconvinced by some of the figures that were produced. Various surveys were  somewhat contradictory in their responses, which may be an occupational hazard.  I am minded that there has to be some level of protection for the Irish hare. I  will wait to see what debate ensues.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Elliott and Mr Beggs will move an amendment later on  hare coursing, and I support that. I am concerned that there must be some level  of protection for the Irish hare. I appreciate the fact that the Minister said  that he would not make interventions but would listen to the debate and respond  at the end. However, if Members were not ultimately persuaded of the merits of  amendment No 37, they might be reassured if the Minister were to indicate that  he intended to continue with special protection orders for the Irish hare. I  look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response and will listen to the rest of the  debate closely.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The broad issue of protection relates to the Irish hare,  the curlew, the golden plover and other species that are named in amendments. I  come from a legal background, and an argument that is used if one is seeking an  injunction is the &ldquo;balance of convenience&rdquo;, which is about the consequences of  doing something and getting it wrong and the consequences of doing nothing.  From that point of view, many of us will want to be persuaded about the best  course of action.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">For instance, if we protect a species that is in no great  need of protection and presume that there will be an opportunity to take it off  the schedule at a later stage, is some damage done? That would have to be  weighed against our getting it wrong by not protecting a species that should be  protected. Would that put that species in a high level of danger? My natural  instinct is to err on the side of caution and use the balance of convenience  argument to provide a general level of protection. I will wait for the  Minister&rsquo;s response. These are complex issues, but we want to protect the best  of our environment and rare species on a scientific and sensible basis. I await  with interest the comments to come from other Members.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  declare an interest as a member of Carrickfergus Borough Council, because the  Bill may impact on local government. In addition, I live in a rural home in 25  acres of farmland, so there may be issues that arise there. Again, I assist on  my father and mum&rsquo;s farm, when needed, on an unremunerated basis.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">This has been a most complex piece of legislation,  certainly the most complex that I have followed. We have the Wildlife and  Natural Environment Bill and the 51 amendments that we are debating, and I have  traced the effect of many of those amendments  through other legislation: the Environment (Northern   Ireland) Order 2002, the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985 and the Game  Preservation Act (Northern    Ireland) 1928. Tracing all the ramifications  of the Bill and the proposed amendments has been a complex and arduous task.  Nevertheless, it is important and worthwhile that we do so. It would be nicer  to be able to change legislation in a less tortuous fashion.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Of the amendments that we are considering; amendment No 6  proposes giving additional protection to the white-tailed eagle, the osprey,  the barn owl, the peregrine and the red kite, all of which are vulnerable birds  that often reuse their nests. They are not found in large numbers and are  endangered to a degree that makes it right and proper to protect their nesting  sites to increase the likelihood of their breeding and sustaining themselves in  the future.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 7 would afford the same protected status to  the common seal and the grey seal as clause 9 proposes to give to basking  sharks. The common seal and the grey seal are not as common as they once were.  They have suffered from poor health and we are aware of threats over the years  that have resulted in many of their deaths. They are important wildlife species  that we should value and protect.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 25 and 45 would give the Department a greater  ability to respond to urgent situations, a principle which I support when  urgency can be demonstrated. Whether that urgency is due to inclement weather  or something that changes suddenly, it is right and proper that there should  not be a tortuous waiting process and extensive consultations before action can  be taken. As regards amendments Nos 27 to 31, I support the protection of the  lapwing, the red shank and the whinchat under schedule 1.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Both considerable support and opposition have been  expressed by many groups about the curlew and the golden plover. Paragraph 118 of my Committee&rsquo;s report sums it up in my mind:  &ldquo;curlew numbers are in decline&rdquo;, and the Department admitted that the recovery  action plan is not working. Yet, the curlew is on the quarry list. Clearly,  something needs to change. It is right and proper that the curlew be given the  level of protection that would be granted in the amendment.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The golden plover&rsquo;s situation is less clear. Paragraph 117  of the same report indicates that its numbers are &ldquo;low but stable&rdquo;. The only  scientific population figure that I have been able to come up with is 20,000 in  2008, with indications that about 12 are shot each winter. Mr Weir talked  earlier about the balance of consequences &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: No:  the balance of convenience.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Beggs: Sorry, the balance of convenience. Looking at  the risk factor, if that were all that we were judging, it does not appear to  be a huge risk factor.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Committee must take all that information on board and  come to a balanced decision. On balance, I am not in favour of giving  protection to the golden plover. However, the situation will have to be  reviewed in the future. Amendment Nos 32 and 34 are consequential to amendment No  29. I will support one but not the other.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure whether amendment No 35 was moved. However,  on principle, I do not see why we should support the keeping of wild animals,  such as those named in amendment Nos 35 and 36, as pets, and I would wish for  that to happen by means of appropriate legislation.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In 2002, it was recognised that the Irish hare was  endangered. In each subsequent year, a special protection order was issued to  enable numbers to recover to sustainable levels. Numbers did recover, although  they did fluctuate, and since the legislation was brought in, the lowest figure  was 1&middot;95 hares per sq km. Special protection orders have largely achieved their  objective of doubling the number of Irish hares. The Department indicated that  the annual cost of implementing each special protection order was between  &pound;35,000 and &pound;40,000. We have to add up the cost each year and justify all costs  that we incur, and it has become clear that it is difficult to continue to  support that annual cost.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It was initially suggested that the Department would not  provide permanent protection for the Irish hare. I was then led to believe that  it would. Now the Department is proposing not to protect it. Based on evidence  about numbers and objectives, on balance, I believe that the temporary special  protection orders have achieved their objective, so there is no justification  for permanent protection at present. Nevertheless, in future years, the  situation will need to be reviewed. To balance that, however, amendments on  hare coursing will be discussed later in the debate.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The reed bunting, twittle and yellowhammer &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Twite.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Beggs: Twite. We obviously have a twitcher present.  I support amendment No 36, which relates to those birds.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Chinese water deer and roe deer are non-native species, so  it is right and proper that they not be released into the wild. We support the  relevant amendments, along with amendment No 41, which lists the various  invasive species of knotweed.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Making judgements on legislation is a difficult balancing  act. Based on the number of Members in the Chamber, the debate has been healthy  for democracy. In far too many debates, very few Members are here. Lobbying for  and against particular aspects of the Bill has been widespread, and it is good  that we must make good, well-informed judgements. Individually, we express our judgement,  and collectively, in order to protect biodiversity, I hope that we achieve the  right balance in the Bill.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  support all the amendments in the second group. However, I shall focus on  amendment No 37, which stands in my name and those of my colleagues. It relates  to the Irish hare or, to give it its proper Latin name, lepus timidus  hibernicus. We seek to have it placed under schedule 5 to the Wildlife (Northern Ireland)  Order 1985 to, in effect, give it permanent protection rather than have a  number of special protection orders in sequence.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Irish hare is potentially the oldest mammal on the island of Ireland, with suggestions that it goes  back around 60,000 years. It is very much part of our local heritage and  culture in Ireland.  The Irish hare is different from the main European hare, which is also rare on  the island of Ireland, and, obviously, it is different  from rabbits. It is distinguished by the black tips on its ears and its long  back legs. For too long, it has been regarded, quite wrongly, as a quarry  species. Full protection in law is necessary to prevent the animal from being  killed, trapped, removed from its habitat, sold or purchased. The problems with  the decline of the Irish hare are not so much to do with predators but with  modern farming techniques, hunting and coursing. Indeed, as hares live above  the ground, they are particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There has already been some debate in the Chamber about the  number of hares and their concentration in Northern Ireland. It is worth  putting that in a wider historical context, leaving aside the smaller  micro-debate on what the trends have been over the past number of years. In  some respects, that puts the issue in the right context and may give people  some assurance about where we should look as a society. The indications are  that the Irish hare was much more prevalent  in the nineteenth century than it is today: we are talking about tens of  thousands in the area covered by Northern Ireland. Its numbers were  subject to decline during the latter part of the nineteenth century and most of  the twentieth century, including in the last decades of the twentieth century.  That decline has been very much linked to the onset of modern farming  techniques. In some respects, the species action plans from around 2000 onwards  have recognised that the conservation of the hare is an issue of which Northern Ireland  needs to be aware. It was highlighted as a priority. The anecdotal evidence  from rural areas also suggests that there has been a major drop in the number  of sightings of Irish hares.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">If we look at the long-term trends, it appears that the  Irish hare is in decline. A lot of Members have focused their comments on  numbers that are based on a very narrow range of data over the past few years  of the first decade of this century. There is certainly controversy around, and  different interpretations of, some of the scientific evidence that has been  produced, including the evidence from Queen&rsquo;s University. However, it is worth  noting that the Irish Hare Initiative argues that the 2002 survey estimate is  unsound for a number of reasons, including the fact that a survey was not  carried out in 2003. Therefore, the 2002 survey does not stand part of a  genuine time-series data set. Also, there was a change in methodology from 2004  onwards.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">If we look at the issue from a local perspective, which may  not be captured properly in the data, it appears that there are particular  problems of depopulation. Compared to other mammals, Irish hares demonstrate a  limited range and dispersal. That means that they tend to live close to where  they were born and do not migrate to new territory. That has quite a drastic impact on local populations:  if hares disappear from an area, they are unlikely to be recolonised.  Therefore, we have a pattern of potential local extinction of the Irish hare,  which has implications for the species overall.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There are difficulties with the methodology that has been  used and adopted. Ultimately, we should err on the side of caution in that  respect. Why should we take a risk with an indigenous and iconic Irish mammal  that is a species unique to our island? Indeed, we should employ the  precautionary principle. That states that when there are threats of serious or  irreversible damage, the lack of full scientific certainty should not be used  as a reason for postponing action. The distinction between precautionary and  preventative action is that action is precautionary if the scientific certainty  is lacking. That may relate to the point that Peter  Weir made about the balance of consequences. I recognise that, if what has been  argued so far is wrong with regard to the stability of Irish hare numbers, the  consequence to the survival of the species here may be dire.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">However, if we are wrong in arguing for special protection,  what are the consequences? As far as I am aware, the Irish hare is not a  predator, and it does not tend to destroy or interfere with agricultural crops.  Its habitat tends to be of a different nature than that of farmland. Indeed, in  respect of the preservation and protection of woodland, it is worth noting that  when the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development introduced its  Forestry Bill recently, it did not seek to cite the hare as a potential threat  to woodland and an animal that would be eligible to be culled as a consequence  of any threat. It is also worth stressing that the precautionary principle is  clear and central to the Northern    Ireland biodiversity strategy. Amendment No  37 is consistent with the broader thrust of biodiversity policy that the  Executive are trying to pursue.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The problem with the special protection orders &mdash; the  temporary protection orders &mdash; is that they do not afford any degree of  certainty. We have had that special protection for most years over the past  decade, but there are uncertainties in the public eye as to what that means,  and there is confusion as to what people are or are not entitled to do. That  risks inconsistency with regard to enforcement and it risks creating loopholes  that could lead to circumstances in which cruelty would be allowed to continue.  There could also be a threat from coursing and poaching that would threaten the  population of the Irish hare.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There is a lack of medium-term &mdash; never mind long-term &mdash;  certainty. Everything is very short term and ad hoc from one year to another,  and there is the risk that that special protection may not be renewed the  following year. I was mystified by Roy Beggs&rsquo;s comments about cost. He said  that &pound;40,000 is needed each year to put special protection in place. Surely,  the logic of that argument would be to go for permanent protection and avoid  the charade whereby we have to go through the institutionalisation of the  introduction of a special protection order every year and incur the associated  costs. Let us give the Irish hare full protection. That will be far better in  the long term.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is also worth stressing that there is a groundswell of  public opinion in favour of full protection for the Irish hare. That includes  the League Against Cruel Sports, Northern Ireland Environment Link, the Hare  Preservation Trust, the Irish Hare Initiative, the Animal Welfare Federation,  the Northern Ireland Badger  Group, the CAL  conservation group and a large number of private individuals. Indeed, there is  evidence from opinion polls conducted by Millward Brown Ulster and Ipsos more  recently that public opinion is in favour of the strong and permanent  protection of the Irish hare.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: My  colleague is learned, and anyone listening to his contribution will know that.  However, with regard to his earlier point about the predatory nature of the  Irish hare, I can bring him to areas in my constituency where people have  planted acres of trees that have been destroyed by the Irish hare. Therefore,  the Irish hare is a predator and can destroy agriculture. On his last point  that public opinion is in favour of full protection, one may always like to  follow public opinion, but public opinion is also in favour of hanging. Would  the Member follow public opinion on that?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am tempted to say that I am not a great fan of Edmund Burke, generally  speaking. However, he made a comment on the importance of elected  representatives being representatives as opposed to delegates, and I tend to  follow that advice. I am not a slavish follower of public opinion per se. We  each come here with our own values as political parties, and we seek to  represent the interests not only of our own constituents but the people of Northern Ireland  to the best of our ability.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Nevertheless, the public&rsquo;s views are a material  fact that we should not dismiss lightly. It is important that we take them into  account, and I am sure that every political party represented here is mindful  of people&rsquo;s views.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Bell also made a point about the Irish hare potentially  destroying crops, woodland and individual trees. However, as I stressed  earlier, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development did not seek to  raise that as an issue when the Forestry Bill was proceeding through the  Assembly only a matter of weeks ago.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  will give way in a second. Therefore, some Members are saying today that the  Irish hare poses a risk, yet the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development implicitly said something different in its Forestry Bill.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Molloy: Is the Member aware that, under the Forestry  Bill, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development gave itself the power  either to compel farmers to deal with animals, regardless of the animal, that  damage new trees on neighbouring land or to allow the Forest Service to deal  with them? Therefore, the Department obviously kept its options open on more  animals than just the hare.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It might be important for the Member to take himself into  the countryside to talk to the orchard owners of County Armagh.  They know about the damage that the hare does to young trees by stripping their  bark. We are discussing not the execution of hares but their protection.</p>
<p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am glad that Mr Molloy brought us back to the fact that we are discussing the  protection of the hare. Although I represent North Down, which can be viewed as  an urbanised part of Northern Ireland,  like other Members, I have roots in the countryside of Northern Ireland,  and I am aware of rural issues. However, it would be a mistake for this issue  to be portrayed as town versus country. It cuts across that divide, and there  are those who live in the countryside who appreciate the importance of the  preservation of that biodiversity. I also appeal to Mr Molloy, who is very aware  of Irish heritage, to acknowledge the importance of the Irish hare in that  heritage.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There is also potential for some of the measures in later  amendments to touch on the interests of the Irish hare. Those include the  habitat protection measures and those that deal with a potential ban on hare  coursing, if, indeed, the amendment on that is moved. Those measures would be  welcome in their own right, but it is worth pointing out that a ban on hare  coursing would not give full protection to the Irish hare, because it would  address only one of the avenues under which it is vulnerable. Coursing  certainly threatens the hare, but wider issues, such as poaching and habitat  destruction, also cause problems. Therefore, rather than working out all the  different scenarios, the only way that we can give comprehensive protection to  the Irish hare is by putting in place an Order that will give full protection,  in all circumstances, to the Irish hare, which is a very important species.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Although I appreciate that the issue was discussed at great  length in Committee and there was a very close vote on it, I was disappointed  with the outcome of those deliberations. My colleague David Ford, who has gone  on to bigger and better things, was a member of that Committee. He was extremely  keen to progress the protection of the Irish hare. Indeed, he was successful in  the past in putting in place similar protections, but, unfortunately those were  not renewed.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There is a certain degree of confusion about the Minister&rsquo;s  position. There is the impression that the Executive agreed on the common  position that would be adopted and the Minister now appears to be running  against his own advice and against what the Department was doing more latterly  after it had given caution to the Committee. He is also running against the  Executive&rsquo;s potentially agreed position on the issue. Hopefully, the Minister  can clarify the Government&rsquo;s formal position on the matter, because the signals  are at best mixed and at worst contradictory. It is important that that be  clarified, and I look forward to hearing the rest of the debate.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  have to declare my interests, and it will be a long declaration, because, apart  from my political life, my entire background has been in nature conservation. I  am a past employee of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and,  indeed, in 1987, I carried out a breeding wader survey for it. For a decade, I  worked for the National Trust, including a year as the manager of the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway. For the past 19 years, I have been the  chairman of the Northern Ireland Raptor Study Group. Raptor is the collective  term for birds of prey, many of which are being discussed today. I remain in  that position. I am about to finish the thirty-fourth year of a study of the  population dynamics of the peregrine falcon.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I have gone into the anorak stage of life in my interest in  wildlife and birds of prey, and I try to keep those facts quiet in case my  colleagues think that I am slightly off-beam because I have interests outside  politics. However, for the purposes of this debate, I have to be open and  honest and declare all those interests. None of them is remunerated, except for  the fact that, in previous years, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency have  grant-aided the work of the Northern Ireland Raptor Study Group, and I have, on  occasions, claimed travelling expenses only for the work that I have carried  out in places such as Fermanagh, north Antrim and east Londonderry.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Because of that background, I have a particular interest in  the legislation. I welcome much of it, but I have deep concerns on one or two  issues. I certainly welcome the protection for the nest sites of rare species  such as the white-tailed eagle, the osprey, the barn owl, the red kite and the  peregrine. I am glad to say that there is real potential that the white-tailed  eagle, the osprey and the red kite will start to nest in Northern Ireland.  Indeed, as a result of the RSPB&rsquo;s reintroduction scheme in south Down, that is  almost inevitable. Therefore, it is important that we protect the nests of  those rare species. Unfortunately, the barn owl is a bird of prey that is  rapidly declining in population in Northern Ireland, and we are  perhaps down to our last 50 pairs. As a child, I remember barn owls being  common, but the species is rapidly on its way out as the result of agricultural  intensification.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There is no evidence of any species in Northern Ireland  being under threat as a result of legitimate field sports and shooting. That is  not the issue. Controlled and responsible shooting does not lead to a  diminution in the overall numbers of any game species. However, the problem is  that the numbers of some species are now so small that shooting or disturbance  could be their coup de gr&acirc;ce. The issue is that a small population could be  eliminated, not that responsible members of BASC or the Countryside Alliance  are involved in any activity that causes a reduction in numbers. It is  important that the nest sites of those species be protected.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I raised that issue with the Minister, and another issue  has just occurred to me in the past few hours. One of the great successes to  come from the work that we are doing on the peregrine falcon in Northern Ireland is that the peregrine falcon is  now nesting in quarries throughout Northern Ireland. I pay tribute to  quarry owners and to the Quarry Products Association for their work in  protecting the peregrine in quarries. Other species also nest in quarries,  including the raven, the ringed plover, the common sandpiper and the kestrel. A  large proportion of the sand martin colonies in Northern Ireland are in quarries or  sandpits. A great deal of good work is being done, and I find quarry owners to  be extremely sympathetic and helpful. However, it occurred to me that  protecting a peregrine nest site in a cliff in a quarry would be impeding the  normal day-to-day activities of a quarry manager who legitimately wished to  remove the space to quarry stone from it. I think that the Minister will  clarify in his winding-up speech that it is possible to move nests, replace  them and provide alternative sites in other parts of the quarry. If that is  possible under the legislation, that is fine, because, if a nest ledge for a  peregrine falcon is lost, it is perfectly feasible to recreate one in another  part of the quarry. That gets around that problem.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I listened with great interest to Mr McHugh, who is no  longer in the Chamber. He made the point that nobody knows why many species of  birds are disappearing, particularly in Fermanagh. A wetland in Fermanagh may  be full of snipe, lapwing and redshank, with the wet pasture and various reeds,  plants and madder providing their food. However, if a bulldozer moves in and  covers the wetland in concrete, the chances are that the snipe, lapwing and  redshank will be lost. The vast majority of threats to wildlife in Northern Ireland  are not from shooting or field sports but from habitat destruction. If habitats  were maintained in Northern    Ireland in their pristine state, the  Province would have few problems with the diminution of its biodiversity.  Therefore, I strongly welcome the fact that curlew, lapwing and redshank will  be protected. In all those cases, their numbers are declining dramatically.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In 1987, I was a member of a team that carried out a  breeding wader survey. All the repeat surveys in Northern Ireland since then show  that all our ground-nesting waders are in real difficulties. Indeed, we are  rapidly moving towards the situation that exists in the rest of the United Kingdom, where nature reserves are the  only places to find breeding waders, the classic examples being the Somerset  Levels and the Ouse Washes in England.  Those are islands of biodiversity in a sea of green desert, because there is no  habitat left for those species. Therefore, with the clear scientific evidence  that our breeding waders are declining, it is essential that we provide them  with special protection. I will not die in a ditch on this issue, but I would  like the golden plover to have been included. However, there is a difference,  and I have to accept it. The golden plover that winter in Northern Ireland  are mostly Icelandic and Scandinavian birds. Indeed, I have had the privilege  of being in Iceland  to help to ring golden plover. We know with a great deal of certainty that they  winter in western Europe, particularly in the British   Isles.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There are about 20 pairs of nesting golden plover in  Northern Ireland, mostly in Fermanagh and the Croagh uplands, with a few in the  glens of Antrim and the uplands around Cushendun and Cushendall. However, it is  a very small population, which is also migratory. Therefore, I suspect that  shooting golden plover in Northern Ireland  has no impact on the indigenous population of the golden plover in Northern Ireland.  That being the case, I understand the Minister&rsquo;s argument for not including  them. However, if only 12 golden plover are shot by BASC members in any given  season, it is hardly a great diminution of their sporting activities if the  species is no longer included. However, I could be swayed either way, and it is  not an issue over which to delay or endanger the legislation.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I have a couple of technical questions for the Minister  about where the great skua features in all of this. There is a schedule of rare  species nesting in Northern    Ireland that are given special protection.  The Minister may be able to reassure me that the schedules can be upgraded or  amended by subordinate legislation without the need for primary legislation. If  that is the case and the great skua is confirmed as nesting in Northern Ireland &mdash; I believe that it is because  a pair has been hanging around the West Light on Rathlin Island  for the past three breeding seasons &mdash; the chances are that we will have that  additional species some day.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The little egret is included in the list. The little egret  will, undoubtedly, nest in Northern    Ireland, if it is not already doing so,  within the next few years. If it is as simple as that, we do not need to worry  about it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Last year, the marsh harrier nested in east Down, the first  time that it has nested in Northern    Ireland in over a century. A pair of marsh  harriers also nested in Fermanagh. I want to tease out why the marsh harrier  has not been included on the list of birds with special protection, but it is  not a particularly difficult issue.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I want to raise the vexed question of Reeves&rsquo;s muntjac. I  am not sure that all Members know what the Reeves&rsquo;s muntjac is. It is a breed  of deer that is about the size of a small Alsatian dog and was introduced in England about a  century ago. The impact of that alien species on the ecology of southern England has  been absolutely devastating. Many Members will have read reports in the &lsquo;The  Daily Telegraph&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Times&rsquo; about the British Trust for Ornithology  report, which indicated that there has been a 91% decline in the population of  the nightingale in England and south Wales. That was not caused by field sports  or disturbance but by the destruction of vegetation by the Reeves&rsquo;s muntjac  and, to a lesser extent, the Chinese water deer and roe deer. That shows the  danger of introducing an alien species into Northern Ireland that has never  been here and has no natural predators. I have already raised the issue with  the Minister that, worryingly, a dead Reeves&rsquo;s muntjac was found in east Down  on the Ards Peninsula. Perhaps it was a road  casualty.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Was it killed by a MP?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Wells: No; it was not killed by a MP.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The significance of that is that someone has been utterly  irresponsible and has attempted to introduce that species into Northern Ireland.  I do not know who did that but, whoever it was, the consequences could be  absolutely devastating for wildlife in Northern Ireland. When that species  starts to breed, it is prolific. It will start to eat away vegetation that is  essential to all sorts of other species, including small mammals and, of  course, game birds, warblers and so on. Therefore, there is a problem. I hope  that the Department will make a special effort to make absolutely certain that  that is nipped in the bud and that the species is removed.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">All other such introductions have been disastrous. The  introduction of the grey squirrel has almost led to the eradication of the  native red squirrel in Northern    Ireland. When the grey squirrel moves into  an area, inevitably the red squirrel moves out. The introduction of mink has  been a complete disaster for game birds. It is an alien species that was  introduced from America and  has spread throughout all of Ireland.  It has been damaging to fisheries and bird life populations. Therefore, surely,  we must learn the lesson not to interfere with nature by bringing in species  that are totally alien to Northern    Ireland.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the issue of the Irish hare. Of course, we will  discuss that further when we debate Mr Beggs&rsquo;s amendment. I have enormous  problems with park hare coursing in Northern Ireland. Perhaps I am one  of few people in the Chamber to have had the dubious pleasure of attending a  park hare coursing event. It was Christmas 1982; I remember it very well. I was  there with the First Minister, the Member for East Belfast.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">No one can tell me that park hare coursing is a sport. No  one can tell me that it is a genuine field sport. Groups that represent  respectable, sensible field sport interests should distance themselves  considerably from park hare coursing. Ordinary field sports involve going out  into open countryside and pitting one&rsquo;s wits against pheasant, grouse or  whatever. Park hare coursing is the catching of a wild animal &mdash; the Irish hare  &mdash; with nets; keeping it in confined conditions for several weeks; releasing it  into an enclosed area; and taking bets on its fate as two greyhounds chase it  around the course. I have witnessed that, and I have witnessed the death of  Irish hares in park hare coursing. To my dying day, I will remember the squeals  of those hares as they were ripped to pieces at Crebilly near Ballymena. That  is not a field sport; it is the torture of a wild animal. If a cat were running  that course, there would be uproar. Because it is a hare, however, it is seen  as acceptable.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The difficulty with the way in which amendments have been  tabled for this afternoon&rsquo;s debate &mdash; it could be this evening before we get to  the vote &mdash; is that Mr Beggs&rsquo;s amendment belongs to the next group. Therefore,  we will not know whether his amendment will be successful before we vote on the  current group. Obviously, I hope that it will be successful, and I congratulate  him on tabling it. For some people in the Chamber the primary reason for  wanting the Irish hare to be protected is to stop hare coursing, but, if the  amendment is successful, that protection would no longer be required. To be  honest, as someone who appreciates the Irish hare and has a general interest in  wildlife, I would prefer full protection; I believe that that is best. However,  if I could look into a crystal ball and see that Mr Beggs&rsquo;s amendment was  successful, I would feel much more reassured. Therefore, I will listen with  interest to the various debates.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am grateful to the Member for giving way. I ask him to clarify that, in his  opinion, the amendments that relate to full protection of the Irish hare and to  the ban on hare coursing are not a case of either/or but, basically, reinforce  that there are circumstances in which the Irish hare is under threat and would  benefit from protection that would not be covered totally by a ban on hare  coursing, welcome as that would be.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  accept that, but Members break down into three categories. First, there are  those who hunt Irish hares, and I have no problem with that, although many of  us feel that it is a very beautiful animal that should be respected and  protected. Secondly, there are those who would not kill an Irish hare in any  circumstances, and I am one such person. Thirdly, there are those who are using  the protection of the Irish hare as a means to an end in order to achieve an  end to what I call a barbaric sport. There are no other words for it. I have  seen it, and it is barbaric, particularly when participants place bets on the  fate of the creature as it is chased by two hounds. That is unacceptable in  modern society and totally divorced from the respectable day-to-day field  sports, which many in the Chamber have a great deal of sympathy for.  Association with this particular activity brings field sports into disrepute.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: Order. We are going to discuss hare  coursing at a later stage, so I ask you to stick to the amendments that are  being debated now.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  accept your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, but you can understand the point that I  am making. There is an overlap because due to the way in which the amendments  have been stacked up, we do not know what will happen downstream. Therefore we  have to allude to hare coursing, to some extent, when we are dealing with the  protection of the Irish hare.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText"><strong>I will make it clear</strong>:  my preference is that the species should be protected, full stop. It should be  given the same protection as the badger, the otter or any other species. That  leaves a large number of legitimate prey species for the hunting fraternity to  pursue without any difficulties. I do not see any reason for not giving the  Irish hare full protection. I listen with great interest to the comments made  by Members and the Minister on this important issue.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McKay: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  The Bill is a lengthy piece of legislation, over which the Environment  Committee pored for many months. As Members have said, there are a number of  controversial issues that many people and parties in our community are  passionate about.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 6 adds five species to the schedule of birds  which will have their nests protected. That list includes the under-threat red  kite, which Mr Wells referred to. The Environment Committee recently went to County Down  to view red kites being released into the wild. That was a fantastic spectacle  of nature, and it is unfortunate and alarming that a number of those birds,  which were released into the wild over recent years, have been killed. It is  vitally important that those species are protected. Sinn F&eacute;in will support  amendment No 6. We will also support amendment No 7, which will protect seals  and grey seals from disturbance, along with the basking shark, as outlined in  the original Bill. Those species are all found in my constituency, North  Antrim, particularly around Rathlin   Island.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I was over on Rathlin last month. One will find seals on  parts of the island which are popular with tourists. They stop near the shore,  and they are in close proximity to tourists and many of the locals on the  island. That happens daily all year round on Rathlin. Given that close  proximity and the possibility and probability of some interaction from time to  time, it is clear that that legislative change needs to be put in place.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Aside from that, there are basking sharks around Rathlin Island. A couple of years ago, some  Committee members went on a trip around the island with representatives of the  RSPB, and we came across a basking shark. It too was a fantastic spectacle of  nature and something which needs to be protected. I urge all Members to go to Rathlin Island and view its wonderful sites and  biodiversity.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In keeping with the Committee, we will welcome and support  the amendments to add to schedule 1 the whinchat, the golden plover, which is  also found in North Antrim, the lapwing and  the redshank. The number of curlews is also down, and it is clear that  voluntary action and the action plan have not worked. It is to be welcomed that  they too will be added to schedule 1.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">My party will support amendment No 25 and amendment Nos 27  to 34. We will oppose the Committee&rsquo;s amendment, No 36. We have been in contact  with bird fanciers and a people who are involved in breeding birds. Although  they did not respond to the Bill initially, they were surprised by the proposal  that the reed bunting, the twite and the yellowhammer be omitted from schedule  4 to the 1985 Order, which lists birds that may be shown for competitive  purposes. In person or by telephone, I have spoken to people from Derry, Ballymoney and other parts of north Antrim who  take their hobby very seriously and pose no threat whatsoever to the birds that  they keep. They give up hours of their spare time every day to look after their  birds. As has already been mentioned, they are subject to quite stringent and  random inspections by the Department, and the welfare of their birds is well  catered for. I welcome the fact that the Minister has decided not to move  amendment No 35, which, if made, would have removed 16 species from the list of  birds that bird fanciers can show.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Aside from that, there is an issue of symmetry with bird  shows not only in the South but across the water. We have received complaints  that birds that can be shown in Britain  and the rest of Ireland  cannot be shown here. That situation needs to be brought into line, and the  legislation will do that. I especially welcome the addition of the crossbill,  hawfinch and blackbird to schedule 4 to the Wildlife Order. Their omission is a  discrepancy that needs to be addressed, and the legislation does that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is important, and the Committee has discussed it  time and again. We need to ensure that the Bill in its entirety minimises the  unnecessary suffering of animals and unnecessary cruel practices inflicted on  our indigenous species. I will address that issue when I speak about snares in  the next group of amendments.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I want to make some comments about the second group of amendments, which deals  with the protection of species. I will go through each amendment one at a time.  There will be some that I am in favour of and others that I am not. That is  fair enough, because we are here as an Assembly to galvanise opinion, whether  it be one that we want to hear or one that we do not. Nevertheless, it is good  to have that opportunity.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 6 adds other kinds of birds to the protected  list in the Wildlife Order. I can fully understand the rationale behind the  protection of those birds, but it must be pointed out that, although a man can  be stopped from disrupting an endangered species, nature cannot be stopped. I  was reading the &lsquo;Shooting Times&rsquo; magazine at the weekend; it carried a headline  that contained the words, &ldquo;raids harrier nest&rdquo;. Some people might blame the  shooting fraternity or gamekeepers, who are much maligned, for such incidents.  However, in this instance, an eagle owl was recorded on video in Scotland  raiding a hen harrier&rsquo;s nest and disrupting it, resulting in the failure of  that nest. That is an example of nature doing things that the Minister would be  unable to stop. I make that point because nature itself sometimes does things  with which people may be unhappy. Shooters are constantly getting the blame for  such incidents. That is wrong, and I wanted to put that on record. I am in  favour of protecting the habitats of the animals that are listed in amendment  No 6.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 7 deals with the protection of the common seal  and the grey seal. Mr McKay mentioned those. The inclusion of those animals on  the protected list would be a good thing, and I fully support that. I read last  week that hundreds of basking sharks &mdash; I need to be careful when I say that  word &mdash; were seen off the coast of Portrush.  That must have been an amazing sight, and the protection of common and grey  seals will enhance sea life around the coast of the Province.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the comments that were made about grey  squirrels. When Sammy Wilson was the Minister of the Environment, I tabled a  couple of questions to see what he was going to do to eradicate the grey  squirrels at Parliament Buildings and on the Stormont estate.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There are a number of grey squirrels about, and I know  people who are very keen to keep the numbers under control, but, at that time,  the Minister was unwilling to give his permission for that to be done. The  reason why we do it, going back to what Jim Wells said earlier, is that the red  squirrel is the native species and the grey squirrel is causing a lot of hassle  and disturbing the number of red squirrels.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The proposed new clause in amendment No 25 seeks to give  special protection to game if it seems that there has been overkill during the  season. As a country sports conservationist, I agree with that amendment as  long as there is correct consultation with representatives of the shooting  organisations, so that those organisations are not left in a similar situation  to that which Europe has inflicted on our  fishermen. As one who represents the fishing industry in Portavogie in the  Strangford constituency, I am very aware that although our fishermen can see  fish on the screens in their boats that scientists are sometimes unable to see,  those scientists are restricting our fishermen from fishing them. We want to do  things honestly and fairly. That is my only fear pertaining to amendment No 25.  I am not against the amendment, but perhaps the Minister could confirm that the  relationship and contact with shooting organisations will continue.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 27 is to do with the curlew. I have heard much  talk about the curlew from various Members around the Chamber. For the record,  I have not shot a curlew in over 20 years. However, I want to make an important  point. I have been contacted by country sports organisations, such as the  Countryside Alliance and BASC, as well as individual sportsmen, concerning the  addition of curlew to the schedule. In Northern Ireland, the conservation  issue for curlew is the breeding population.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is widely accepted that the curlew population has  declined because of habitat loss through the intensification of farming and  loss of peat land, and predation by foxes and crows during the nesting season,  when we really need control. It is believed that the breeding population  migrates out of Northern    Ireland during the winter. Limited shooting  during the winter should not have had any significant impact on the breeding  population. The facts are very clear. The winter population in the UK is stable,  with signs of recent increase. Some Members have mentioned that the numbers are  down, but that is not entirely true; the numbers are rising. If there is going  to be a ban on something, I have to ask myself why that is the case. Does  shooting have that much impact? I say no, it does not.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The shooting bag of curlew from the major sites of Lough  Erne, Lough Foyle and Strangford Lough, in the area that I represent, used to  be about 50 to 150 a winter until 2006, after which it dropped to under 20.  Now, with the BASC-led voluntary moratorium, it is under 10. Therefore, the  shooting organisations are clearly making a very valiant and significant  attempt to protect that population, and it is something that they have done  themselves. If all those organisations are working so hard to do something that  some people want to see happening, why not leave it to them to do the job that  they are doing, because they are doing it right? That is my point, and that is  why I am unhappy with the decision to add curlew to the list. I do not believe  that it is necessary.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The shooting community has already demonstrated its  concerns for curlew through its widely effective moratorium on shooting, and  that success has been clearly illustrated right across the Province. Removing  the incentive to restore the breeding population by removing curlew shooting  will be counterproductive. I suggest to those who are intent on adding curlew  to the protected list that they look at the reasons for that, because, when we  look at the statistics and the information, the reasons do not stack up. RSPB  and NIEA supported the moratorium approach over statutory protection for those  reasons.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The only realistic hope for breeding curlew is for the Northern Ireland  statutory and non-statutory agencies to work with groups and individuals with a  vested interest in the species, as such co-operative initiatives have the  greatest chances of success. To develop a practical restoration and  conservation programme, population monitoring needs to be increased; knowledge  of the migratory movements of breeding birds and practical habitats improved;  and more effective nest predator control put in place. Control the foxes and  the crows and the curlew numbers will increase. Endorsing the shooting  moratorium and reviewing its effectiveness after five years will strongly  encourage the shooting community to play its full part in the restoration  programme. I cannot support amendment No 27, but I can offer some support for  amendment No 33.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 28 proposes the inclusion of lapwing in  schedule 1. I have no issue with that amendment and will support it  accordingly. Amendment No 29 proposes the inclusion of the golden plover. Other  Members have spoken well on this issue. The golden plover wintering population  in Northern Ireland is at  least stable, if not slightly increasing, with over 21,000 birds counted in the  2008 peak month &mdash; more birds that are likely to winter in Northern Ireland  have also been counted. Over 10 years, the BASC Northern Ireland membership&rsquo;s  average bag of golden plover was only 12 birds per winter.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">One Member has asked why we should fight so strongly to  have the golden plover retained as a quarry species, although I accept his  conclusion. It is because there is the opportunity to shoot them if people so  wish and they happen to be there. I think that I have shot only two or three in  my lifetime &mdash; my three in some 30-odd years works out at one every ten years,  so that is one for the Members. Such a low number cannot negatively impact on  the population. Removal from the quarry list is not required for the  conservation of that species. The facts are clearly not there; they do not  stack up. The numbers of golden plover are there and are increasing, and the  bag taken by those involved in wildfowling and others is so nominal that taking  the bird off the list of quarried species would not be effective.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The small numbers that are shot is not an argument that  protection will not affect many shooters. The freedom to take small numbers  should be retained unless there is a good reason to remove it. The &lsquo;Shooting  Times&rsquo; includes articles on shooting areas in different parts of the United  Kingdom, and a few months ago, it featured an article on Strangford lough.  People from the mainland and the Republic   of Ireland were coming to  Strangford lough to take advantage of the large numbers of golden plover there.  I believe that there is an economic reason why we should retain the current  situation. I am speaking specifically about my territory and constituency of  Strangford, where it is necessary to take advantage of all economic and tourism  opportunities that may arise.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The current take of golden plover is undoubtedly  sustainable. A precedent is being set for future ill-founded recommendations,  which, I believe, damage the credibility of the Committee. I know that the  Chairperson has proposed that the numbers should be capped and protected, but I  feel that that is wrong. The Committee should provide evidence-based advice,  which it has not done so far, as the figures do not stack up. The best  interests of the environment and wildlife in Northern Ireland, and of those who  enjoy them through sustainable use, are not being served. I will, therefore,  oppose amendment Nos 32 and 34.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 30 and 31 propose the inclusion of the  redshank and the whinchat. Again, I have no issue with the inclusion of the  redshank and whinchat in the schedule. I am quite happy to see those  recommendations coming forward, and I will support the Minister in that regard.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will move away from discussing those who partake in  shooting and country sports to discuss aviculture. I will oppose amendment No  36, and I want to outline why, because I feel that the reasons are worthy of  note. I have been contacted by aviculture enthusiasts who have some issue with  amendment Nos 35 and 36; although I understand that amendment No 36 is the one  that will be discussed today. I am reliably informed that the declining numbers  of many of our wild birds have no connection with the hobby of aviculture.  There are a great many people involved in that in all constituencies, and  certainly in the area that I represent. For example, the Comber bird show  attracts many people not just from my constituency but from all about. I ask  myself why we want to pursue those guys when they are doing a great job and  making a significant contribution.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Changing farming practices have had the biggest effect on  the issue as farming traditions have modernised and changed. It is not  financially viable for farmers to change that modernisation, and we would not  ask them to do so, yet the aviculture groups are being penalised. Why are they  being penalised? I feel that it is wrong.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Many of the seedling weeds on which seed eaters feed have  been greatly controlled, and the odd corners of land where such weeds have  survived have been largely built on. Thousands of songbirds are killed by  sparrowhawks, which are protected, and numerous fledglings are taken by hooded  crows, which are not protected. Thousands more are taken by domestic and feral cats.  It seems ludicrous to me, aviculturists and a great many people outside that  that reduction is due to aviculturists alone. I believe that it is unfair to  make them pay for that, given all the other reasons why it is really happening.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Department should take greater responsibility for the  reduction in the number of greenfinch, linnet, bullfinch, twite and goldfinch.  Those birds&rsquo; daily diets mostly comprise seeding dandelions that are cut on  verges while in seed and are often sprayed with weedkiller by council and DOE  workers, who should perhaps also take some of the responsibility. However,  there is no mention of that in the schedule. The rest of the UK will not  have reductions on twite, yellowhammer and reed bunting. Therefore, why are we  doing it here when the rest of the UK is not? That is why the  amendment is wrong.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">DOE wildlife branch, in giving evidence to the Committee,  explained that aviculture was monitored in Northern Ireland, and the officials  were satisfied with their findings. My opinion is that proper weight was not  given to DOE wildlife branch, to the detriment of the aviculture sector.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I also oppose amendment No 37, which proposes to insert the  Irish hare in the schedule. I have been contacted by numerous representatives about that issue. Let me be clear: that  amendment would ban all forms of hare hunting. I have been contacted by various  clubs, as well as the Irish Foot Harriers Association, which also strongly opposes  the amendment. Those clubs believe that the amendment would cause job losses,  damage the economic and social fabric of rural communities and reduce the  ability of members to contribute to the range of Irish hare culture initiatives  that are clearly contrary to the stated aims of the Bill.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There are a number of people in the Public Gallery who have  worked industriously on those issues, and I thank them for their hard work.  They include Lyle Plant from the Countryside Alliance, Tommy Mayne from BASC,  and John Agnew. A number of other people have spoken on the issue, and it is  very clear that opinion is gathering momentum in opposition to the amendment.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Professor Ian Montgomery of Queen&rsquo;s University, Belfast  (QUB), who is regarded as the leading expert in Irish hare ecology, is  repeatedly on record as saying that people who are involved in hare hunting  make a significant contribution to the research carried out by QUB and to the  management of Irish hare populations. He is also on record as saying that any restrictions  on sustainable activities would have a negative effect on Irish hare  populations. Removing the opportunity to hunt hares would remove an important  management incentive, because those who hunt hares have a vested interest in  their well-being. It is not unrealistic for people who are interested in the  quarry that they seek to want to ensure that the hares&rsquo; habitat is correct and  that things are well. That has been demonstrated by the willingness of hare  hunters to participate in research initiatives, and, clearly, they have done  that over a long period.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">According to a 2009 survey by Queen&rsquo;s University, Belfast, the Irish hare  population is stable and relatively abundant. People in rural communities have  confirmed that that is the case. In fact, there are Irish hares on my land,  which, for the record, I have never touched. We try to preserve and retain  their habitat. The 2009 survey puts the Irish hare population density at 1&middot;95  per square kilometre. The 2010 species action plan set a target of two Irish  hares per square kilometre. Therefore, we are almost there. In fact, we could  hardly be closer to the target. In 2002, Irish hare population densities were  recorded as one per square kilometre. Therefore, the hare population has  doubled between 2002 and 2009.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In a published summary of responses to consultation on the  Bill, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency said that only six of the 37  respondents were in favour of the amendment. Therefore, the protection of the  Irish hare is against the expressed wishes of the great majority of  respondents. I will leave Members with those points. I support amendment Nos  38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 45 and 48. I have concerns about a number of issues and, on  behalf of the people whom I have had the great pleasure to help and support  over the years as an elected representative, I will be opposing those  amendments.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Kinahan: I hesitate to speak, following the  expertise of Mr Wells and Mr Shannon. I hope that their numbers are stable and  that they are unlikely to breed too much. Perhaps they should be protected.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">This group of amendments concerns the protection of  species. When looking at such lists, I am always intrigued that it is we humans  who choose what we protect, given that there are thousands of birds, insects  and other animals. I return to my earlier point that we need to keep such lists  under review. We are learning all the time. Therefore, we must protect the  species that need to be protected.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Committee took a great deal of evidence. I thank all  those who came to the Committee, all those who listened and all those with whom  we argued. It was extremely useful. Our job is to listen to everybody and then  to take the difficult decisions.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is the rural community that looks after the countryside.  It is the farmers, whose names are blackened all the time, who do the hard work  of looking after the hedging, woods and land, and who balance what is happening  in front of them with their meagre incomes. It is the estate owners, many of  whom look after their lands and an ASSI. It is the gamekeepers, the fishermen  and all the countryside groups. We should not forget that they, along with  groups such as the RSPB, are the eyes on the ground. It is they who give us the  detail and who keep us in line. We should not detract from all their hard work.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am not going to speak on every amendment because many  good points have already been made. However, I welcome the 14-day period of  protection. I do that as a means of congratulating the shooting communities  that this year, during the cold spell, went out and fed the birds. The shooting  communities are looking after the ground and protecting species.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Listening to the debate has been very educational.  Initially, I wanted the curlew to be protected; I still do. I remember hearing  curlews when I was small, but I have not heard them since. I could not tell you  what a curlew looks like, because I never saw one, but I heard them. We no  longer see curlews, and that is grounds enough to protect them. I struggled  with the protection of the golden plover. As there are not many around, I  thought that we should not necessarily protect them. However, my opinion was  then thrown after talking to somebody, which illustrates that we have to keep  learning. Apparently, there is a hybrid golden plover in Northern Ireland,  and, at Junction One in Antrim, there are large numbers of that bird, although  I am not suggesting that anyone go shooting there. We are constantly learning  about birds and animals as they change. We should keep that in mind,  particularly you, Jim.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to hear that the Minister is listening to  everyone, and I agree with amendment Nos 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31, which he has  proposed. I also agree with the Minister on the showing of birds, with which I  had struggled because I did not like the idea of birds being kept in cages. We  were lobbied by people who collect, look after and show certain birds, and I  was in two minds about that. However, the Minister has cleared up the issue for  me today. As no birds are being caught illegally in Northern Ireland, we should leave  the situation as it is.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">At the moment, the Irish hare has a great deal of  protection, and I agree that it is the loss of habitat that is doing most of  the damage, not hunting or coursing. I remember, again as a child, always  seeing loads of hares at Aldergrove airport. Now, however, one would hardly see  any. When the planes took off, people used to see hares all around the airport.  That is just one example of what we have done to get rid of a species in a  certain area.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We had a target to double the number of Irish hares, but we  are told that the numbers are stable and we have achieved that target. However,  I go back to the main point that I have been making throughout the process,  which is that we must keep reviewing our information, keep it up to date and be  able to make changes if needed.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am also told that, due to interbreeding, there are  hybrids of the Irish hare, they move around a bit and most people would not  know the difference between an Irish hare and a brown hare. Therefore, we have  to keep monitoring the situation and keep trying to make sure that our knowledge  is up to date.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I was intrigued by the evidence of one of the witnesses at  our Committee. That person told us about the amount of damage that the Irish  hare does to trees and young saplings. During the cold weather, when there were  high volumes of snow, hares hopped over high fences, which were no longer high  because of the snow, and went around biting the bottoms off the trees. Again,  we have to make sure that we get our facts right and realise that Irish hare  can be a pest.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">What worries me is that an attack on hunting and other ways  of countryside living is hidden in the Bill&rsquo;s protection of the hare. In England,  hunting was very much a class war. We have always been very lucky here, because  loads of different people hunt, particular those from the farming community.  The protection of the hare was not in the Bill originally; it was added and  discussed at the Committee. The argument for its inclusion was lost initially,  but it crept back in as an amendment. As I said, the hare is already protected,  in that there is a lengthy close season, and, strangely, if I may demonstrate  that I am ignorant of certain points, I should say that it is protected at  night and on Sundays.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We are told that there was a groundswell of public opinion  in favour of including a protection. That may be the case with small groups.  However, we must remember to question those small groups, because the  information that forges public opinion is not always accurate.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">On the hunting side, there are 31 packs, three beagle packs  and some 500 members with horses and hounds. If the Irish hare were  overprotected, a whole way of life that has existed for years would be got rid  of.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There is no alternative to the actual chasing of the fox or  the hare that works particularly well. I will give an example to amuse Members.  While in Germany,  where fox hunting has been banned, I was sitting quietly having breakfast when  someone said, &ldquo;We have lost our runner today for the bloodhounds. Danny, would  you run?&rdquo; Therefore, I declare an interest, as I have been both the hunter and  the hunted. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> However, my frame was such  and my speed was so poor that the bloodhounds caught me in the second field.  They were really bored as they lolloped alongside me as though they were  asking, &ldquo;Where do we go next?&rdquo; However, I digress.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We have had hunting for 2,000 years. If I put my art hat  on, I can tell Members that it has been depicted in paintings. It is part of  our lifestyle, it is ongoing, and I would hate to see it disappear.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The hare is not at risk. At the moment, there is not a  scientific justification for going for stronger protection for it, so I do not  support amendment No 37.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will quickly run through the amendments from amendment No  38 to amendment No 45. Where the duty to consult councils is concerned, it is  sad that our council system is sometimes very slow to respond. If we could  change things in our councils, their response could be much quicker. We should  not count them out, given that some councils will know that much better than  ourselves.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Minister for what he has brought before us so far today on the  second group of amendments. I also thank him for informing us of those  amendments that he will be agreeing with and those that he will not. As other  Members have said, this is a difficult piece of legislation. There is a lot of  information in the Bill, and a lot of time was spent dealing with its many  aspects.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Committee staff for all their efforts in trying  to keep everything right, ensuring that everything was printed and that  everybody&rsquo;s words were got. Indeed, the Hansard staff had more of a difficulty  than anybody in keeping some of the comments right. Certainly, it is good to be  at this stage, where we are now nearing the end of what has been a lengthy  process.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I do not intend to speak to many of the amendments in the  second group. I intend to speak only to amendment No 36, which was asking the  House to support the removal of the reed bunting, twite and yellowhammer from  the list of birds that may be shown for competition purposes. Recently, I held  a meeting with a group representing aviculturalists, and I led a delegation to  meet the Minister to raise their concerns about the removal of those three  birds. I have no doubt that they will welcome the Minister&rsquo;s position on that  today.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Minister saying that he is not moving amendment No 35  will be even more welcome, as that will allow aviculturalists to show more  birds and to take part in a wider range of judging activities. It was evident  at the meeting with aviculturalists that they felt that it would be a  retrograde step for those birds to be taken off the current list, which would,  without doubt, have left them at a disadvantage compared with aviculturalists  across the United Kingdom  and the Republic   of Ireland.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In my discussions with those aviculturalists, a question  came up that came up back in 1984, when the draft Wildlife Order was being  discussed. Peter Robinson, who I  believe chaired the Committee at that time, asked whether there was any natural  reason, because of environmental or climatic conditions, why Northern Ireland should require a different  standard from that which pertains in Great Britain. I do not believe  that there was an answer then, and I do not believe that any justifiable  answers can be given now as to why that should not be the case. I welcome the  fact that Danny Kinahan and other Members stated that they agree with the  position that was put forward by the Minister, and I look forward to equal  treatment for aviculturalists here compared with those in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Bell: I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s bringing forward of  the Bill. It contains many important issues that have already been addressed,  including biodiversity. In Strangford, we have led the way in biodiversity in  the Castle Espie development, which I think was the first significant  investment in biodiversity.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There are many extremely good points in the Bill. There are  some with which, on conscience, I beg to disagree, similar to my colleague Mr  Shannon. In preparation for the debate, I listened to a range of sources,  including the Countryside Alliance, the British Association for Shooting and  Conservation, and different groups with specific interests in natural species  that wrote to and e-mailed me. I considered all the material, and I am even  more convinced that farmers and those involved in the Association for Country  Sports are some of the best guardians of the countryside that this Province and  the United Kingdom  can boast. Their commitment is to animal welfare; their commitment is to the  development of the natural environment; and their commitment, in many cases  their voluntary commitment, has been significant in the promotion of the  species that have been referred to in some of the amendments.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I take the Ronald Reagan, small-government approach, which  is that legislation should exist only where it is strictly necessary.  Legislation should be shown to be strictly necessary and an evidence base  produced to demonstrate it. I support the case for the basking shark, and the  Minister outlined the need for and the significance of that measure. There is  no alternative natural habitat for them and there is a need for them to be  protected. That case has been clearly made.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I understand the concerns about curlew numbers. I equally  understand that all the country sports and shooting fraternities, bar one, took  upon themselves a voluntary moratorium and disciplined themselves very  effectively. I understand that their voluntary moratorium nearly led to the  number of curlew being in single figures. It ended up as 10 in the course of a  year, but it was nearly one.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The point has been made many times about voluntary bans on  activities of organisations such as the British Association of Shooting and  Conservation. That is well and good and I welcome it. However, unfortunately  that group does not represent every shooter in Northern Ireland. Legislation would  not be required if everyone acted responsibly. We have to make legislation for  the shooter affectionately known as the marsh cowboy &mdash; the guy who shoots  occasionally and is not affiliated to any gun club or any responsible field  sports organisation and who goes out and does his own thing. I certainly have  come across such people in my time and they can be completely irresponsible. If  we could achieve a situation in which everyone was a member of a recognised  body, life would be much easier for all concerned. The legislation has to cover  not only the responsible shooter but the individual who shoots occasionally and  will simply disobey any rule or any voluntary ban.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: The  honourable Member makes a point. I was one of those students present at Queen&rsquo;s  when he came to lecture as a senior figure. Although I may differ from him, &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption]</span>.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I was referring to his seniority. Although I may disagree  with him in the argument, we all respect the commitment that Jim Wells has to  animal welfare and the consistent approach that he has taken over decades. We  may disagree in parts, but that does not mean that we cannot respect each  other.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There are a number of points to be made about Mr Wells&rsquo;s  point about the curlew, which he made well. First, we should not penalise the vast  majority because of the cowboy. The cowboy, I suspect, will not be  significantly deterred by this legislation. Significant numbers of curlews have  been curtailed by the conservation fraternity, which has kept them to fewer  than 10 in a year.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the evidence is not that we need this legislation  to protect curlews against the cowboy operator, but it is surely that the  diminution of the curlew population is a result of changes in the landscape.  Therefore, penalising the shooting fraternity, which is already operating in a  voluntary capacity with a moratorium, risks antagonising it and will not be  effective. In this case, our evidence base refers to around 10 in 12 months, so  what we have in place has already been effective. Therefore, my argument for  small government is that we do not need to replicate it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ian McCrea has held a series of meetings with  aviculturalists, about which he briefed us. He made his point about amendment  No 36, which refers to the reed bunting, the twite and the yellowhammer. That  case was also well made. Again, the evidence base is that the provision exists  in the rest of the United Kingdom  and the Republic   of Ireland, and there is  no coherent argument on the basis of environment or climate to bring in  legislation. Therefore, it should not be brought in. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s  move on the situation of the golden plover, for which a similar case was laid.  The current legislation is effective. The introduction of new legislation would  counter the maxim that you should not try to fix something that is not broken.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There should be no unnecessary interference with the  countryside way of life. Anyone who feels that the farming fraternity is  anything less than interested in the best welfare of animals does not know the  Strangford farmers whom I know. They care for their livestock and their natural  environment, which they enhance. Farmers in Strangford have told me that their  wish is to pass on their farms in a better state than when they found them.  That stands as testament to their commitment as true guardians of the countryside.  They do not need legislation to change their way of life.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Shannon: The Member rightly says that farmers  deserve recognition for what they do. They are the true custodians and  guardians of the countryside, and they carry out those roles exceptionally  well. Their efforts and contributions should be recognised.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  agree that farmers should be encouraged in what they do. Legislation should be  brought in only where it is shown to be necessary.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We are all interested in the future welfare of the Irish  hare. The Minister set out the existing evidence base that clearly shows full  protection to be unnecessary. Research from our universities and elsewhere  indicates the future welfare of the Irish hare, and that will be subject to  review. We must bear in mind what the Minister said earlier about the survey  evidence. In light of that, a move towards full protection would be draconian  and unnecessary.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wells spoke passionately about hare coursing, and  Members will debate that later. I am cognisant of the Deputy Speaker&rsquo;s  direction. Equally, it should be acknowledged that many people in the sporting  fraternity go out of their way to muzzle their greyhounds to prevent the sort  of abuse that was referred to earlier and to provide an identified means of escape  for the hare. People who keep beagles can also maintain their way of life and  avail themselves of the realistic protection that exists.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">For generations, the countryside has been entrusted to the  farming fraternity. For generations, the sporting fraternities have, in the  main, regulated their behaviour well and promoted animal welfare. Therefore, we  should seek to interfere and legislate only in areas for which there is a  proven evidence base. We should not be led by the vagary of public opinion. We  should go where the evidence leads us, and it shows that there are certain  areas for which legislation is needed.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I contend that the species that I outlined when talking  about amendment No 36 &mdash; the curlew, the golden plover and the Irish hare &mdash; are  being well protected on a voluntary basis. Future legislation would be  excessively costly to implement at a time when the Budget for Northern Ireland  will be extremely difficult.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We should seek to encourage those in the Countryside  Alliance, the guardians of the countryside, who work above and beyond the call  of duty to promote their areas. One method of encouragement would to implement  legislation only where it has been proven to be strictly necessary.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I support all the amendments: they are essential to the sustainability and  retention of biodiversity. I will not go into detail on most of the issues, but  I particularly welcome amendment No 29, which calls for the golden plover to be  protected and amendment No 27, which does the same for the curlew.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">However, I am mainly concerned about amendment No 26, which  relates to the Irish hare, a subject that concerns me greatly. Unlike Mr Wells,  I have been to Crebilly and heard a hare being torn apart. I will refer to that  experience when we debate the third group of amendments.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">My concern about the Irish hare is not new. On first  entering the Assembly, David Ford and I co-signed a motion that proposed  permanent protection for the Irish hare, an issue about which I have strong  feelings. I recognise that the Irish hare is subject to an annually renewed  special protection order, but that has not been effective. The Irish hare must  be protected permanently.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Regardless of what other Members said, the Irish hare is  under threat. The evidence cited in the consultation document, for example,  shows that, since the special protection order was introduced in 2002, there  has been no consistent increase in the Irish hare population &mdash; it has gone up  and down, year on year. The gathering of statistics is problematic. The special  protection order has been ineffective; the Irish hare should be one of the  animals that receives protection at all times.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">For so long as the Irish hare continues to be less than  fully protected and regarded as a game species, its population will remain  under threat. The current situation, in which the Irish hare is protected only  during certain periods of the year, sends an inconsistent message and hampers  any enforcement of the protection order. The consultation document includes the  statistic that, in 2002, there was one Irish hare per square kilometre. The  document claims that, in 2004, there were five Irish hares per square  kilometre.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I do not accept the figure for the base year of 2002. Those  figures are totally out of line with all the others. If we take 2004 as the  base year, for example, there was a 50% fall in the number of hares over the  next few years. Therefore, the methodology used is extremely suspect. I am not  sure how the research was carried out, but those figures cast significant doubt  on it. There is no long-term evidence of an increase. As I said earlier, if the  population goes up one year, it may go down the next, so it is not stable. One  cannot use those figures as a basis to suggest that there is a long-term trend  and that the Irish hare population is now stable and sustainable.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Another issue that relates particularly to the Irish hare  is the fact that it is a top target for wildlife crime, as is the badger. As  such, it needs additional protection. Mr Shannon talked about all the groups  that supported his view that the Irish hare should not be protected. Some  groups have a vested interest. Instead of considering their views, we should  consider those of environmental groups, all of which support the permanent  protection of the Irish hare. One opinion poll, which included people who live  in rural communities, showed public support of about 70%. As Dr Farry said,  based on the precautionary principle, we do not know the long-term trends for  Irish hare populations. We do not know what the critical mass for that species  is, so the population could fall below its critical mass and it would be too  late to do anything about it. The evidence for population recovery is limited,  so we should not take a chance; we should give the Irish hare permanent  protection.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Much has been said to which I want  to reply. I considered leaving it until later to get to my feet; however,  issues were raised about habitat and biodiversity in relation to the Irish  hare. The Committee has done a great deal of work and there has been a great  deal of lobbying, but, having listened to the debate so far, there is still a  two-sided argument. There is not the balance that one would expect. It is not  good enough for Members simply to adopt a view and not be prepared to accept  the other side of the argument. Members in favour of hunting and shooting must  be prepared to take account of the other view, which is supported by an  increasing number of people.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Irish hare has been iconic in our country for a very  long time. There is enough habitat in Fermanagh for it to survive. Around my  farm, the numbers indicate that, for many years, the species has had no  difficulty in surviving. Mr Wells said that planning decisions have devastated  many habitat areas in Fermanagh. I am not sure whether that gives the full  picture for the Irish hare or, indeed, for many other species, including the  curlew. Some years ago, there were quite a number of pairs of curlew in the  area. Nowadays, they visit but they do not seem to stay; they certainly do not  nest.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Forty years ago, many people used wild bog land for  walking; yet even though far fewer people use them now, curlew populations are  declining, so there must be other reasons that we are not taking into account.  Some of them have been mentioned: foxes and mink &mdash; an invasive species &mdash; clear  nests, as do grey crows and magpies. They have to live on something. Forty or  50 years ago, every farm was mixed; there was not the specialisation that there  is now. All sorts of fowl ranged free on most farms, and they were available  for foxes, which do not have any of that today. As a result, they are forced to  live on wild species, such as ducks. In addition, given the number of grey  crows, I am sure that shooters are no longer interested in wasting cartridges  on them.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, there is no question that planning has done a  great deal of harm. Even now, planning permission is granted for houses in the  middle of bog land. If planners had had any wit, they would have, at the very  least, protected those species. Once people are moved into what would otherwise  be an isolated and rural spot, certain species must move out if they are to  build nests etc. All of that has happened, and we are in a different position  now. A couple of hundred hectares of land at the Marble Arch caves global  geopark at Cuilcagh are largely untouched by people and yet it is an area in  which all of these species are in decline.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Jim Shannon mentioned research and development from the  &lsquo;Shooting Times&rsquo;. I am not sure that we should believe all that comes from that  source because of its biased nature. I have read some of its articles many  times, but even I have difficulty with using any of it any more. Nevertheless,  it has to argue its corner.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Irish hare is under particular pressure from changes in  farming that have taken place over a number of years. However, even beagle  hunting is in decline now. Going back a number of years, sons, fathers and  grandfathers hunted in almost every townland, but that practice is dwindling.  Those who are arguing for a total ban should be happy that that is the way  forward because a ban will only cause hunting to be reinvented and become  popular, which is not what they may well have in mind. Hare coursing is a  different matter altogether.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I already mentioned the amendment relating to the  protection of the environment, flora and fauna. I have taken a great interest  in the countryside for a long time with respect to the preservation of species,  and I have seen both sides of the divide. I am all for the survival of many of  the species that have been argued for to this point. However, we have to take  into account the impact of other species in the countryside and their impact on  declining species or those we want to protect. People have asked why we have  protected so many species that are harming themselves, such as grey crows. The  impact of the fox on the bird population has to be taken into account. Surveys  on diseases and depopulation have not been looked at fully. We need to monitor,  rather than ban, species. There is definitely a need to watch and monitor them  in the future. I am not sure whether we should introduce at total ban at this  point.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Jim Shannon mentioned the curlew with respect to the quarry  list. I do not know why anyone would want to shoot them, but there is certainly  a tremendous decline in their numbers across Ireland,  the exception being parts of Galway where  people do not seem to travel into the boglands. The curlew is in greater  numbers in those areas.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will come back to other issues later in the debate.  Habitats need to be studied, and there needs to be more research and interest  from those who have the money or who are able to monitor what happens in rural  areas for us to know exactly what is happening to habitats.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Some of the amendments make no sense. However, I support  most of those that are concerned with habitats, apart from one or two with  which I have difficulty.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I thank those Members who have participated in the debate  thus far. Dr Farry was the first Member to raise the Irish hare. The Irish hare  survey carried out for my Department by Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast reported a  five-year average for 2005 to 2010 of greater than two hares per sq kilometre.  If anyone needed any convincing on the subject, they should have listened to Mr  Brian Wilson, who clearly does not understand how the hare population rises and  falls. It does not go on a yearly pattern. Had he any scientific knowledge of  hare breeding patterns, he would not have made that argument; in doing so, he  demonstrated his ignorance. I will take the word of Dr Ian Montgomery before I  take that of Mr Wilson.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the Executive&rsquo;s position, further papers  were put to Executive Ministers on the back of further amendments being  received. However, other Ministers would not allow those positions to be taken.  Further letters were issued on the basis of fresh amendments, and that is why  we are where we are.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is acknowledged,  with regard to most of the species that we are referring to today, that hunting  is not the problem: the problem lies with habitat management. There has  been a considerable change in habitat management, particularly between the  Second World War and the 1990s. As a result of habitat loss, we have lost many  of our key species; however, some of them are beginning to recover, including  the Irish hare. Issues relating to the welfare of the Irish hare will be  discussed later in the debate.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wells is very knowledgeable on these subjects, and he  has invested much of his life in his passion for bird watching and bird  protection. With regard to the great skewer, the schedules can be changed by  subordinate legislation: what we are legislating on today will not be permanent  for the next 20 years. Mr Wells identified a number of other species that may be  making a comeback in Northern    Ireland, and we will be careful to take note  when that is brought to our attention and move the issue forward.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We have the support of quarry owners with regard to the  nests of peregrine falcons. Licensing provisions under the Wildlife Order  allows the movement of such nests at an appropriate time of the year to allow  quarries to continue their business.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There is a special management plan to control the muntjac  deer in Northern Ireland.  An action plan targeted at the Ards   Peninsula has been  initiated, with local landowners and rights holders all actively engaged. I am  not sure whether Mr Shannon is aware of that yet, but I am sure that he will be  happy to participate in that management issue.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Shannon raised the issue of special protection for game  in amendment No 25. I confirm that shooting interests are actively engaged in  siting such protection, particularly when required during severe weather. The  organisations that we consult include the British Association for Shooting and  Conservation and the Countryside Alliance.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I note the points made about the Irish hare, including  their contribution to country sports, particularly in the beagling community. I  recognise the difficulties that accepting Mr Farry&rsquo;s proposal would cause.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">With regard to aviculture, I note that there is widespread  support for the position that I have adopted in relation to amendment Nos 35  and 36, which is same as that adopted by the rest of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I do not see how we will be doing anything to benefit  wildlife if we adopt a position in Northern Ireland different to that which is  taken in the jurisdiction south of the border or across the water.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Some people still argue that the curlew should not be  removed from the quarry list. There are around 100 to 200 breeding pairs of  curlews in Northern Ireland,  and there is an issue with why that population has dropped so dramatically. Mr  Wells rightly pointed out that the reason for that drop was not as the result  of hunting, but through the loss of its habitat, although hunting could have an  effect at this point. I thank all those responsible country sports enthusiasts  who have engaged in the voluntary moratorium. Unfortunately, one club was not  prepared to participate in that moratorium, so in essence it is that club that  has brought about the situation where are looking at taking it off the quarry  list. On the other hand, there are over 20,000 golden plovers in Northern Ireland,  and we are not doing anything to protect that particular population by not  allowing a small amount of hunting. There is a fundamental difference between  the situation of the golden plover and that of the curlew.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Department was engaged for some time in the Glenwhirry  project in County   Antrim. It was very happy  to support that programme, and I trust that we will be able to continue with it  in due course. The programme was developed with the support of the local farming community and the RSPB. This is where  wildlife can really benefit: when organisations with an interest in the  countryside come together with organisations that are interested in animal  welfare and conservation. As a result of supporting the local farmers in  Glenwhirry in conjunction with RSPB, we were able to put a gamekeeper in that  area. That gamekeeper took out around 600 foxes. Some people may be horrified  by that fact, but as a consequence of that reduction in fox numbers, there has  been an uplift in the number of hares and lapwings and a steadying in the  number of curlew in that area. That will take us into another debate at a later  stage, because the gamekeeper could only operate with the full suite of  facilities that were available to him. If we are serious about protecting the  curlew, enhancing the population of Irish hare and looking at other bird  species that suffer from predatory animals such as foxes, grey-backed crows and  magpies, we will have to ensure that those who control those predatory species  have the mechanisms to do so. We will need to fully discuss that issue before  the Bill is passed.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr McHugh asked why the Department is protecting  grey-backed crows. We do not protect grey-backed crows, and I do not know where  that came from. Grey-backed crows are not a protected species and are one of  the biggest pests in our environment.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am happy to go to a vote on a number of these issues. It  has been a rational and reasoned debate, and the Assembly can produce a Bill of  good quality as a consequence of the work that has been done thus far.</p>

<p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment:  The issue of continued snare use in the North drew responses from many  organisations and individuals that provided evidence to the Committee as we  considered the Bill. In fact, in addition to detailed written responses, we  received a number of single-line e-mails from the general public, urging us to  use this opportunity to stop the use of snares in the North for good.  Undoubtedly, this is an emotive issue, and the Committee spent considerable  time debating it. From the outset, however, it was clear that its members were  unanimous in wanting tighter controls on snares than those that are offered in  the Bill.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Committee sought further information from the Assembly  Research Service on a range of aspects of snare use, including new snare  technology, snare guidelines and the use of snares and pest control in Europe. One particular area of interest to the Committee  was the opportunities that new technology might have to offer and whether that  would lead to more humane methods of controlling pest species. The guidelines  for use of snares made it clear to Committee members that it is a complex area,  in which it is easy to fall foul of the current laws inadvertently and end up  being prosecuted for malpractice.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Members were also told that the UK and Ireland are two of  only five countries in the EU that allow the use of snares and that it is  possible that permitting the use of snares contravenes the Convention on the  Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitat &mdash; the Bern Convention &mdash;  which prohibits the use of all indiscriminate means of capture. Fortunately,  the Committee was able to seek an assurance that neither country had been  challenged under the convention.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Department advised the Committee that, although a  licensing regime was feasible, the resource implications of putting one in  place and operating it were unknown. Does anyone know how many snares are in  use in the North and, realistically, would it be possible to encompass those in  a practical and effective licensing system?</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Committee eventually considered two options. One was  the introduction of a licensing regime that would require all snares to be  licensed, along with a requirement for set snares to be checked once every 12  hours. The other option was a complete ban. When the decision was eventually  made, the Committee supported a complete ban on all snare use, for which I urge  support.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Before I move away entirely from the subject of snares, I  wish to mention the possible inclusion of spring traps in the legislation,  should amendment No 16 be made. As part of its scrutiny process, the Committee  wrote to other Departments and public bodies to seek their opinion on the Bill.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In its response, the Department of Agriculture  recommended that the Department of the Environment should assume overall  responsibility for traps and snares. The Committee accepts that recommendation  and its support of amendment No 16, which transfers the legislation for spring  traps from the Welfare of Animals Act to the Wildlife Order and responsibility  from DARD to DOE.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Committee heard evidence from deer experts who raised  two key issues of concern. The first was the timing of the proposed close  season for deer. Based on the evidence provided, although it was necessary to  reduce the close season to allow for appropriate population control, it was  essential that it was done in a way that kept suffering to a minimum. The  Committee was advised that extending the period into the autumn, as drafted in  the Bill, would increase the risk of orphan calves being left too young to fend  for themselves. However, allowing control to commence earlier in the spring  would avoid that problem, so the Committee recommended that the appropriate  amendment to clause 26 be made. Accordingly, I welcome amendment No 20.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Another area of concern for the Committee was the inclusion  of a clause that would permit shooting from a stationary vehicle. The  Department advised that that clause was to assist deer keepers to manage their  herds more conveniently, but experts consulted by the Committee did not see the  necessity for that clause. In addition, there was a suggestion that that  increased flexibility could facilitate poaching. Therefore, in the absence of  any apparent advantage and at the risk of making poaching easier, the Committee  recommended that the clause should not be included in the Bill. The Committee  was also pleased that the Minister recently advised that he too would oppose  the inclusion of that clause.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Before leaving the issue of deer, I must mention that the  Department advised the Committee of the likelihood of an amendment being tabled  to ensure that the control of non-native deer species was as humane as  possible. The Committee accepted that in principle and welcomes amendment No 19  accordingly.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Before I finish, which Members will be glad to hear will be  very soon, I want to draw attention to an amendment that was tabled only last  week, long after the Committee reported on the Bill. Mr Beggs and Mr Elliott&rsquo;s  amendment to ban hare coursing is one such amendment. There is no Committee  position on the amendment. Mind you, after all the Committee processes that we  went through, I do not know whether we would have appreciated going through  that. Nevertheless, I will take this opportunity to say a few words from the  personal perspective of an MLA for Newry and Armagh.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Hare coursing today is park coursing in which two muzzled  greyhounds pursue a hare for a short time in an enclosed field. A banning of  regulated coursing has seen an increase in the demise of hare populations in England. I wish  to seek some clarity, because there seems to be some difference between what Mr  Bell and Mr Wells were talking about. Obviously, there are 30 years between  coursing without muzzles and coursing with muzzles. Mr Wells was out of the  Chamber when that was mentioned, and it is something that we need to look at.  It is an emotive subject. Hare coursing looks like a brutal sport, but now  there is the issue that dogs are being muzzled. We need to accept the value  that those pursuits bring to local rural communities. It is estimated that  coursing generates millions of pounds to the rural economy.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Wells: There is a dichotomy in the Member&rsquo;s position  in that it is OK to terrorise a hare by chasing it through an enclosed space  with two greyhounds following it, but it is wrong to snare. I suspect that many  Members believe that both are equally cruel.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I know where the Member is coming from on the issue,  because, at his annual conference, Mr Ferris moved a motion that forced his  party to support hare coursing because of a view held particularly in the Kerry  and Connaught area. That has put him and many  of his party members in a difficult position. I know that many of them  privately find it very difficult to support park hare coursing, but they have  been whipped and dragooned into doing so.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will explain the Member&rsquo;s point about the difference. As  one of the veterans of this institution, I was here between 1982 and 1986 when  the issue was discussed at great length. In Crebilly and Eglish, which may be  in his constituency &mdash; Eglish is perhaps just outside it &mdash; in the old days, the  hare was coursed, the greyhounds had no muzzles, and success was measured in  the twisting and turning of the hounds. Inevitably, a proportion of the hares  were caught, and they were pulled to pieces in front of several hundred people,  much to their amusement, apart from the few who heard their screams.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">At that time, when the Assembly tried to oppose it,  the Conservative Government said no. They were not prepared to run with a ban.  Eventually, after much discussion with the Irish Coursing Club, it was agreed  that muzzles would be put on the hounds. Does the Member believe that a hare is  any less terrorised if it is being pursued by two greyhounds that are muzzled?</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I suspect that the Member, personally, does not support  park hare coursing. However, he has been forced by his party to do so. I  suspect that a good half of the Members from his party are in the same  position. However, they must obey the Whip. They know what the consequences  will be if they do otherwise. I am worried that he is going down the route of  whipping his party on an issue that is clearly one of conscience. I plead with  him to allow Members a free vote, as most other parties are doing, on what is  an emotive issue.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment: I  thank the Member for his intervention. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> I  do not believe that anyone will be whipped in my party or any other. It would  certainly not be for me to try to whip Martin Ferris into any situation.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I was simply seeking clarity on a point that Mr Bell made.  However, I gave you an opportunity to have your say on the matter. There is a  point that you &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Bell: Will the Chairperson give way?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment:  Yes.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Bell: Can the Member give way again to Mr Wells? I  do not engage in the activity, but I understand that it is not just a matter of  the chase. Having spoken to members of the sporting fraternity, I understand  that not only are greyhounds muzzled so that they cannot hurt or injure hares  in the barbaric way that happened 30 years ago, as Mr Wells described, but  hares are provided with a means of escape.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment:  Thank you very much for clarifying that point. I am glad that the party is not  divided on the matter and that you support the argument.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to pick up  on Mr Wells&rsquo;s remark that he is willing to listen to the debate on the third group  of amendments before he decides whether to support full protection. How would  he realistically protect the hare when the Minister has difficulty with paying  &pound;40,000 to &pound;50,000 to monitor it? How would you actually provide and implement  full protection for the Irish hare?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  want to make the point that several hares die at every coursing meeting, even  when hounds are muzzled. They are killed as a result of being hit by hounds  with their muzzles. It is not a conservation issue as much as it is about  protecting the hare population. The issue is whether, in the twenty-first  century, it is morally right for so-called civilised human beings to take bets  on the fate of a terrified animal that is being chased by two hounds in an  enclosed area. How can any civilised person stand over that so-called sport? It  has nothing to do with field sports, in which the animal has an opportunity to  escape into its natural habitat. Coursing is a stressful situation for the  animal that is caught. It may have a way out. However, on many occasions, it  does not reach the way out. Is that acceptable? I do not believe for one moment  that the Member believes that it is acceptable. However, he has been told to  take a certain action. He must obey, because he knows what the consequences  will be if he does not.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment: I  am over 21 years of age now, Mr Wells; I can make my own decisions. I must say  that you still did not answer the point about full protection &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: Order. The Chairperson must make all  remarks through the Chair. It would be nice if the entire Chamber were included  in the debate. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Through the Chair, Mr Wells did not answer my  question. The Minister knows well that he has not got the resources to protect  the Irish hare fully. He changed his mind just before he came into the Chamber.  That is fair enough; he is entitled to do that. However, the fear is that if  coursing were banned, it would be driven underground.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Wells: In Northern Ireland, coursing has been  suspended at Crebilly and Eglish as a result of a wise decision by the DUP  Environment Minister to bring in a special protection order.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">There is no evidence of it being driven  underground. What happens is that those who want to partake in that barbaric  sport go down to somewhere such as Clonmel, for instance, and enjoy their  sadistic pleasure there. There is no need to worry about it going underground.  It is very difficult to run a coursing meeting, which requires several dozen  bookies, a large enclosed space and, often, several hundred spectators. That  could not be done underground in Northern Ireland. We could not have  a Crebilly that would not be discovered by the police. Therefore I do not see  the Member&rsquo;s argument.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am also worried by the view that an activity cannot be  banned because it might be driven underground. An activity is either right or  it is wrong. If it is wrong, the PSNI should be brought in to enforce the law.  I do not believe that the Member believes a word that he is saying.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment:  That is very considerate of you to say so, Mr Wells. However, you still have  not answered the question about full protection. I will leave it at that, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Weir: Judging on the last exchange, the party  opposite seems to have taken a very strange position of being anti-snare in all  circumstances, but pro-hare coursing. It is the party opposite that is caught  in a trap, and it seems that no escape route has been left for it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is no secret that I am not the greatest fan of field or  blood sports; they are not my cup of tea. At this point, I can sense the itchy  trigger finger of Mr Shannon, who may, at some stage, be about to give me both  barrels; metaphorically, I hope, and not literally, as he might have been  tempted to do at various stages.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I want to touch on two areas of the third group of  amendments. I welcome the range of sensible amendments that the Minister has  proposed in this group. Hare coursing has been touched on, and, I am sure,  there will be other contributions. I will listen with interest to Mr Wells&rsquo;s  contribution, in particular, at a later stage. Even as someone who is not the  world&rsquo;s greatest fan of field sports, I see a very clear distinction. As  commented earlier, the defence of other field sports can, at times, be damaged  by association with hare coursing. However, there is a strong distinction  between those who are shooters and hare coursing, which, I think, deliberately  goes &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Dr Farry: Will the Member reflect further on the  comments that he has made on the definition of sport, particularly in  connection with field sports? We often hear that sport is only a game and that  other things are more important. Surely, one of the characteristics of sport is  the potential for the participants to compete on another occasion. Does the  notion of field sports, particularly in connection with the destruction of  animals, not cut off the potential for sport, since the participants will never  have the chance for a rematch?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Weir: It is somewhat esoteric to get into an  argument about what is and is not a sport. If the DCAL Minister were here, he  could give a better answer. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, Mr McCausland is not here. I hear comments from  a sedentary position in relation to that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I regard hare coursing as barbaric and belonging in a  different century. It is a case of the barbarians not being at the gate but  being at the hare course.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The defence that a hare can be chased by large, muzzled  dogs and allowed an escape route does not cut a great deal of ice with me.  Whether there should be a free vote, and whether, as Mr Wells suggested, Mr  Boylan was acting under duress in that regard, Mr Boylan and, more freely, Mr  Bell, defended hare coursing, and I suspect that they will do so in the future.  Perhaps, in a cross-community manner, we could have the two of them in the  Chamber and release a couple of large dogs to go after them, albeit with an  assurance to them that both dogs were muzzled and that a door was left open for  their escape.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">However, I must say that I regard that argument as a fairly  weak defence of a so-called sport. For example, shooting something that will be  eaten later is a perfectly reasonable thing to do, but to defend betting on  blood sports as some sort of countryside pursuit is a weak argument. There is a  distinction to be drawn between those activities involving animals that are  legal and those that are not. Indeed, if we were to go back far enough in time,  we would, perhaps, be dealing with bear-baiting, cockfighting or dogfighting,  all of which have, at various stages, been made illegal. This issue falls into  that category.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Beggs: It was said earlier that banning hare  coursing would drive it underground. However, if we were to use that argument,  we would not ban cockfighting, dogfighting or a range of other barbaric acts.  Does the Member concur?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: To  say that banning hare coursing will drive it underground is a weak argument.  Despite what the Committee Chairperson said, a lot of similar things that  happened elsewhere were challenged on that basis. There is no strong evidence  to suggest that such activities have been driven underground. However, even if  an activity were driven underground, that cannot be used as an excuse to make  it acceptable. As Mr Wells said, if something is fundamentally wrong, which  hare coursing is, it should be banned. Consequently, I support the amendments  on that matter that Mr Beggs and Mr Elliott tabled.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The other issue is the lack of logic in the position of the  party on the opposite Benches on the subject of snares. Society has legitimate  reasons for killing animals. Those include, among others, population control  and the need for food and even clothing. Sport is not a word that should be  used to describe hare coursing. There is, to a degree, a need to control the  populations of certain wild animals. When the Committee first debated snares,  we were faced with a black-and-white situation. We could either support the  present, somewhat unregulated, situation, or we could have a complete ban on  snares. Subsequently, the Minister has brought forward sensible amendments on  snares. The use of snares does not rest easily on the shoulders of many animal  lovers, but if we were not to support the regulation of snares and the  Minister&rsquo;s amendments, we could not then kid ourselves that there is a better  way to regulate the populations of those animals.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">For those who genuinely believe in animal welfare, the  Minister&rsquo;s amendments are sensible. We do not want to go down the route of  allowing the use of poisons or other methods that could have very bad  consequences. The amendments concerning snares are sensible. However, on both  the major issues, Sinn F&eacute;in has got it badly wrong.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment:  Will the Member clarify his remarks? He talked about the cruelty of hare  coursing. There have been instances in which domestic animals have been trapped  in snares. Is that not just as cruel? He said that there needs to be a degree  of control, but surely he cannot divide one from the other, especially if an  animal is trapped in a snare for more than 24 hours, which is what is being  suggested. It is either cruel or it is not cruel.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Weir: First, there must be some level of control of  wild animals, and secondly, there must be a mechanism for doing that. There is  no perfect solution: there is no rural idyll in which animals can be controlled  without, unfortunately, some degree of pain. However, there is a massive  distinction to be made between first, the need to control an animal population,  particularly wild animals, which has to be regulated in the way that the  Minister&rsquo;s amendments propose, and secondly, people who use animals for the  pleasure of seeing them being chased, hurt and killed. That is cruelty for its  own sake.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: The  Member&rsquo;s point is that, although there is no great taste for snares, we have to  recognise that for landowners who are controlling their land, the alternative  of using poison, as the Member said &mdash; perhaps he will develop that point &mdash; is  much more indiscriminate and would have a much more negative effect on domestic  animals.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is our point, rather than that we support  snares in some way.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Weir: I thank the Member for his comments. As I  said, there is a necessity to have a degree of control of animals in the wild,  particularly in farmland and rural areas. Snares are not a perfect solution,  but they are the best solution available. For those of us who see ourselves as  animal lovers, snares are a necessary evil; they are fundamentally necessary.  The alternative methods of control would be much more indiscriminate. If they  were not regulated properly, those measures would be much more harmful to the  animal population as a whole, and that is the fundamental difference. In my  mind, it beggars belief how hare coursing, which this amendment proposes to  ban, is in any way a necessary evil. It is an evil, but it is not necessary.  Consequently, I support Mr Beggs&rsquo;s amendment, and I support the Minister&rsquo;s  position on snares and the Minister&rsquo;s position on the other amendments in this  group, which are a bit less controversial.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  will start by discussing snares, which, I have to admit, I had little knowledge  of until evidence came to the Committee. Snares are foreign to me; I have no  knowledge of them in my East Antrim community.  Like many other Members, I was concerned by the illustrations of cruelty  suffered by some animals caught in snares, which we heard during the progress  of the Bill.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In the early stages I was minded to ban snares. However, in  Committee I learnt of the importance of snares in regulating a number of  predators, such as foxes, which prey on ground-nesting birds. That was  mentioned by the Minister a short time ago. Evidence to the Committee showed  that 30% of foxes caught in Northern    Ireland were caught using some form of  snare, so they do have a function. However, if they are to be used, they ought  to be used in a humane fashion. There has to be fuller understanding by the  urban community of the effect that foxes have in rural communities. They are  not like cuddly little dogs. They grab defenceless little lambs from their  mother and murder them. Therefore, there is a danger that other animals will be  exposed to risk if the fox population is not regulated.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McKay: I thank the Member for giving way. Does he  agree that the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union&rsquo;s position on this matter, which it has  outlined in correspondence with a number of bodies and on local radio stations,  is that the use of snares is not considered to be part of common farming practice?  From memory, I believe that it has also said that it is not an issue and that  snares are not used in sheep farming.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  concur with that view. I have no knowledge of snaring whatsoever. However, even  just a short time ago the Minister told us that 600 foxes were controlled in  the Antrim hills. I understand that snaring was part of that process. If those  600 foxes had not been controlled in the Antrim hills, what do you think would  have happened to lambs there? I have no doubt that lambs would have been lifted  and, furthermore, a number of ground-nesting bird species would have been  decimated.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Aside from lambs, I have personal experience as a  primary-school child of going to collect eggs in the hen house only to find  that foxes had got in and the whole house was decimated. Foxes do not lift one  hen, they kill everything. They might not even take a bird away with them. It  is somehow in their nature to kill everything, and that was a cruel lesson that  I learnt as a young child. Earlier this year, my sister suffered a similar fate  with her small collection of three hens. They were killed by a roaming fox, as  were her replacement ones. It must be understood that there are two sides to  the issue. It is not just the fox; it is the animals that the fox will kill.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There are other issues that ought to be of concern to the  urban community, in case it thinks that this is a purely rural situation. I  expect that, within the last fortnight, Members have picked up the media  comments about the urban fox; I think it was in London. The fox has lost its shyness.  Generally a fox will run a mile from a human, but in the urban environment that  is changing. It appears that a fox entered a house through a cat flap, went  upstairs and attacked two babies as they slept. It is not just an issue that  affects the rural community; it is an issue that could affect the urban  community, including that in Northern    Ireland.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Shannon: Will the Member give way?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Beggs: In a minute. If we are going to regulate the  fox in the urban situation, I do not think we want Jim Shannon with his  12-gauge shotgun or whatever. That is just not doable. The question I have to  put to Members who oppose the use of snares outright is how they will regulate  foxes in an urban environment, given that discharging of firearms would not be  acceptable.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Shannon: I thank the Member for giving way. There is  not a Jim Shannon in every field in the Province, but that is not the issue.  The Member mentioned the mauling of the twins by a fox on the UK mainland. Is  he aware that there has been another incident of that, where another fox has  mauled a child?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  was not aware of a further issue, but it is increasing my concern, and I hope  that Members are listening. I am looking for an answer from Members present.  How are they going to regulate foxes in the urban environment?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>:  The example that the Member refers to is of a fox in the middle of London, a large city. We  are talking about the use of snares in rural areas. Is the Member seriously  proposing that we use snares in urban areas &mdash; in towns and cities? Should we  put snares on lamp posts? Is the Member seriously considering that? Does he not  realise that, in that context, snares could also pose a serious threat to young  children?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Beggs: I fully agree that snares could pose a  threat. One has to assess the alternative threat. Perhaps Members who have yet  to speak can tell us how to regulate foxes in the urban environment. I have no  doubt that foxes also exist in the urban environment in Northern Ireland.  Remember, that was not just a one-off, as has been pointed out; it has happened  on a second occasion at least.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Regulating the number of foxes is important to the rural  community. It is not just about lambs and hens; it is also about how we make  use of our uplands, which may well be of no economic benefit to other farming  practices and where bird shoots exist. That enables additional moneys to come  into the rural community through gamekeepers and other activities that could  flow from that, such as bed and breakfasts etc, for those who wish to partake  of such activities.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Last year I went for a ramble with the East Antrim Rambling  Club, and we visited Glenwhirry. We got to see some of that upland, which is  managed by a gamekeeper at considerable expense to the individuals who are  funding it. That has enabled the return of the red grouse, which is breeding.  It is encouraging to see that. Again, without the control of the predators,  that would not have been possible and that bit of land would have been barren  and of no benefit whatsoever to the community.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I agree, because of the evidence we have been given, that  the indiscriminate use of snares should not be accepted. That is why I support  the Minister&rsquo;s viewpoint that we should license the use of all snares. If  snares were licensed, those who value them and are responsible for setting them  would have to regulate and to examine closely their patch in order to operate  within the rules, and, if they did not do so, their snares could be taken away.  The regulation of snares would mean that ID tags could be produced to make it  clear who was laying them and whether or not they were doing so in an  appropriate, systematic and responsible manner.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment:  Will the Member clarify who would enforce that and where the resources would come  from? It is all right to talk about a licensing system, but the problem, which  the Member and I saw in Committee, is the lack of enforcement in every aspect  and part of legislation. Therefore, will the Member clarify exactly who would  enforce that?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: It  would be up to the public to enforce it. However, I am sure that there would  also be some licensing officers. I wish to pose a question to the Member: who  will regulate snares that are used without a licence? Banning snares in their  entirety will lead to the indiscriminate use of snares that are not regulated and  inspected regularly.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McGlone: We must inject some degree of realism into  the debate. The use of snares or weapons, be they rifles or whatever else that  people use to control foxes and other vermin, is the only realistic method  available to people. If it were not for that method of control, many ASSIs  would have little or no wildlife in them, never mind our worrying about whether  or not they will be designated as an ASSI.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Beggs: I concur with the Member. However, I have yet  to hear how predatory animals will be regulated. It is nice to take the view  that we should not use anything that will harm an animal. However, if that  animal is causing greater harm and pain to other animals, it is reasonable to  intervene.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There has been a late amendment on the use of spring traps,  and I must admit that I winced when I saw some of the detail. That issue was  not discussed in Committee, so I have no knowledge of such traps other than  those used to catch mice and rats. However, the traps to which the amendment  refers are not used for mice and rats. This is not a nice subject, but how  should vermin or pests be controlled? People put down rat poison to control  rats, because they think that that is an easy measure and a humane way to kill  them. However, I suspect that being poisoned is not a happy end to a rat&rsquo;s  life. Another animal may subsequently eat the dead rat; therefore, there are  difficulties for the environment in that respect.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I have not examined the content of that amendment in  detail. However, in so far as it is a straight lift from the legislation from  DARD and has simply been placed alongside this similar legislation, I accept  that it is reasonable. It may be appropriate to examine, inspect and amend that  legislation at some point in the future. Before making any amendments, it is  important that we have a full understanding of the legislation. I hope that  there would be consultation with the community about the use of those devices,  of which I have no knowledge, at present.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I move to the issue of hare coursing. Why do I want to ban  it? My personal views are similar to those expressed by Mr Wells. First, I wish  to highlight the fact that, even if the Irish hare were protected, possible  loopholes mean that hare coursing could continue. Therefore, irrespective of the  outcome of that vote, I believe that a ban on hare coursing is appropriate. It  has been suggested that, for example, the brown hare would not be covered by  the protection and that, if someone were able to catch it, he or she could use  it for hare coursing. The issue is, therefore, wider than the protection of the  Irish hare. I am attempting to tackle the issue of hare coursing with the  amendment that I have tabled. Hare coursing is not an appropriate form of  so-called sport.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As I understand it, there are only two hare coursing clubs  in Northern Ireland:  one in Dungannon and one outside Ballymena. Neither has operated since the  special protection order was put in place six or eight years ago. Therefore, we  are talking about banning something that only two clubs do and which even they  have not done for some eight years. Banning hare coursing would not affect many  people and would maintain the status quo.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I view hare coursing, as does Mr Wells, as a sport that  involves trapping a very private and sensitive wild animal. Wild hares are  difficult to approach and do not like human contact. On the few occasions on  which I have seen a wild hare, as soon as I went into the field, off it went.  Coursing involves holding that wild animal in a confined and unnatural space  for days or weeks. It is then released into an enclosure, another very  restricted space, into which two greyhounds are released, muzzled or otherwise,  to race against it for the amusement of spectators. Hare coursing is trapping a  wild animal and getting amusement from its being chased by greyhounds. That is  not appropriate. The hare is in a highly stressful situation, even when it is  being held.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the Irish hare would also be in a stressful  situation if it got caught in a snare?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Beggs: I have no doubt that that could well be true.  That is why it is important that there be an appropriate regulatory licensing  regime, that those using snares without a licence be banned from doing so and  that all snares be regularly inspected.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Wells: Not that I support snaring, but does the  Member accept that there is a fundamental difference between it and hare  coursing? Snaring is a necessary evil to protect crops, but hare coursing takes  place so that some people can exercise their bloodlust for a totally  unnecessary barbaric sport.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Beggs: I concur. Hare coursing is not about  regulating a pest or putting food on the table; it is about man collecting a  wild animal and deriving amusement from its being chased by a hound. That is  not an honourable sport for anyone to be involved in.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr D Bradley: I have listened to Members whose  characterisation of those who attend coursing meetings has been nothing short  of disgraceful. Those who attend coursing meetings have been demonised here  today and portrayed by Mr Weir as bloodthirsty barbarians. However, those are  not the people whom I know or who live close to me who are interested in  coursing. People do not go to coursing meetings to exercise a bloodthirsty  desire to see an animal suffer; they go to admire the speed and agility of the  hounds. The fact that, over the years, measures have been taken to muzzle the  hounds, to provide an escape route for the hares and, indeed, to return the  hares to their natural habitat proves that the people involved are not the  demons and barbarians that some Members have portrayed them today.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Beggs: The Member is entitled to his view. I have  endeavoured not to demonise those involved in hare coursing; however, I do not  think that it is an appropriate sport in this day and age. If someone wishes to  enjoy the speed of a greyhound, I would much prefer that they go to a  racecourse to enjoy watching greyhounds chase a mechanical hare rather than a  wild one. It is on that basis that I said what I did.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will give Members some more information about amendment  No 26, which I tabled. I did not invent the wording; I lifted it straight from  English and Welsh legislation that has been in place for some time. The  experience is that it appears to be reasonable and workable. I lifted the  wording verbatim, to the best of my knowledge, so that the amendment would  identify a range of circumstances in which coursing would be banned. If the  amendment was made, those participating, those attending and those facilitating  hare coursing, including landowners, would all be encompassed in the  legislation. The legislation would also cover those who enter the dog for the  event, those who permit the dog to be entered for the event and those who  handle the dog during the event. Thus, if my amendment was made, the  legislation would cover a wide range of people, and it would be competent and  capable of bringing hare coursing to an end. For that reason, I urge Members to  listen carefully to what is said and to bring about an end to an inappropriate  so-called sport.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I was advised that consequential amendments would be  required to go alongside amendment No 26, which is why amendment Nos 49 and 50  were tabled. However, I have since learned that those amendments are more  extensive than I had intended them to be, so I will not move them today. I will  still move amendment No 26 when I have the opportunity to do so shortly.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I ask Members to take the opportunity to end hare coursing  once and for all and remove any of the loopholes that may exist, such as  whether there is full protection for the Irish hare, to ensure that, in future,  no hare will suffer from hare coursing in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Dr Farry: The debate on this group of amendments has  been somewhat strange so far. One section of the House defends hare coursing  but attacks the use of snares, while another section of the House advocates the  opposite. On these Benches, we support the banning of hare coursing and the use  of snares, because that is the only consistent way forward.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will put my cards  on the table: I regard hare coursing and those who attend such activities  as barbaric. Hare coursing is no different from dog fights, cock fights or  other activities from our uncivilised past, such as bear-baiting. Its purpose  is to give people some warped sense of amusement from the torment of an animal.  No purpose that directly serves humankind is obtained. There are other  activities in which animals have to be used for foods and other by-products,  but there are no such benefits to our society from hare coursing. It should be  banned, and it is part of the long lineage of activities on which society has  rightly turned its back over time.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I also reject the notion that hare coursing is a sport. The  comments that I made in response to Mr Weir&rsquo;s contribution were in no way meant  to be esoteric. The genuine point to be made is that any talk of hare coursing  as a sport is a massive misnomer. Even when the greyhounds are muzzled, there  is potential for major damage to the hare through physical and psychological  trauma. Hares may also be permanently injured or die as a consequence.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Bell: I thank the Member for North Down for giving  way, and what I am about to say applies equally to Mr Beggs. Dr Farry talked  about the physical and psychological trauma to the hare. Would the Members both  not agree that exactly the same trauma is caused by anglers, who place a barbed  hook into a fish&rsquo;s mouth, suspend it and bring it in for their own pleasure?  Are the Members going to propose banning fishing as well because of the  physical and psychological trauma to the fish?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Dr Farry: The difference with fishing is that the  intention is to eat the fish after catching it. Certainly, that is what I do  with fish. I am not sure what Mr Bell does with the fish that he comes across.  However, that goes to the point that I was making. There are circumstances in  which one may wish to capture or hunt animals for food. Indeed, there is  farming, which also leads to the killing of animals, but that is for food or  other by-products.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Molloy: Is the Member saying that the issue is not  the pain or the welfare of animals but whether someone can benefit by eating  the animal? Or is the issue just the act of killing it? If people enjoy  chicken, it is quite all right to put it through the trauma. However, because  they maybe do not like something else, they do not.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Member spoke about fishing. In the past, people have  been able to catch very little because, in most cases, fish conservancy means  having to put the fish back. Therefore, not only do people catch it, suspend it  and pull it out for their own pleasure, they throw it back in again.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Dr Farry: That intervention raises a number of issues.  I work on the assumption that people catch fish to eat them. I cannot quite get  my head around the concept of fishing and then throwing them back in. However,  the fish will live to fight another day in those circumstances. The point was  made that killing animals for food involves pain. However, that is balanced by  the practical reality that many of us eat meat as part of our diet, and slaughter  is required.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Wells: There is a fundamental difference. In  fishing, death is usually quick. Therefore, the stress caused to the animal is  for a very short period. The Irish hare has eight weeks of stress being kept in  confined conditions and then the stress of the chase. Therefore, the stress is  prolonged. Secondly, hare coursing is done purely for public entertainment.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Dr Farry: That is right. Further to the point that Mr  Wells made about the stress that is caused to the hare, there is also the issue  of what happens during captivity leading up to coursing. There is also the  question of what may happen afterwards, and the injuries may be such that they  do not immediately lead to the death or otherwise of the animal, which may go  through a long period of pain.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As for the use of animals for food, there is a debate in  society about how humane we can make the process of rearing animals for meat  and how they are farmed and slaughtered. Although I accept that we can go only  so far in addressing some of the issues of concern, we have also seen a major  evolution as a society with regard to the standards that we seek. One of the  better advertisements not just for Northern Ireland but these islands  is that our standards are a lot higher than those in other parts of the world  and other parts of the European Union.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Coursing is simply about the pleasure of those who are  watching and participating in the activity. It does not have any other benefits  for society. In that respect, it is no different from other historical examples  of mankind tormenting animals for pleasure, and we have, quite rightly, turned  our back on those practices. There is no risk of coursing going underground,  and, even if there were such a risk, that is no reason why we should not take a  stance as a society and say that coursing is fundamentally wrong.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Snares, too, are fundamentally wrong. It is worth noting,  with the qualification that I mentioned earlier to Mr Bell, that there is  overwhelming evidence of public opinion being very much against the use of  snares. Mr Beggs made the point about shifting from the current indiscriminate  use of snares to a regulatory situation. However, even if we move to regulating  snares, they are, by definition, indiscriminate. Even if they are regulated, one  cannot say that a particular snare is for a particular animal and will only be  used on that animal. One has no control over what animal &mdash; wild or domestic  animals or, indeed, a human &mdash; may come across the snare and get caught. The  notion of them being used in an urban environment is quite frightening.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Animals that are caught in snares can go through agonising  experiences and suffer both physical and psychological trauma. They can suffer  slow and agonising deaths. The skeletal remains of animals have been found in  snares that have not been properly monitored and in which the animals have been  left to rot. There is also evidence that animals try to chew off their own  limbs in order to escape from snares. Other animals struggle in snares, making  the situation worse. I appreciate that the Minister is trying to move on a  graduated scale towards regulation; he is trying to make something that is  difficult for many people not as bad as it may otherwise be. I recognise and  respect that we are potentially on a journey. However, my opinion and that of  the people whom I represent is that we would prefer that snares are not used at  all.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">That throws up the challenge of what alternatives we should  employ. I make the point again that the use of a snare is indiscriminate. One  cannot control what is caught in it. One alternative is poison, but it, too, is  indiscriminate. I do not see either as being an alternative to the other; both  are counterproductive as they are not effective or discriminating.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Beggs: If the Member believes that each of those  items is unsuitable, how will we regulate predatory animals?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Dr Farry: Mr Beggs has a very good knack of  anticipating the next point. The challenge has been thrown up. I recognise that  certain animals are pests and need to be captured and killed. That is a part of  regulation and conservation in the countryside. There is, however, the  possibility of using netting and other non-lethal traps to capture animals and  then disposing of them in a much more humane manner. That is where we need to  focus our attention. They may be more costly and expensive to install and use,  but that is no excuse for lowering our standards. Members should reflect on  where people want us to go and on the standards that they want for society with  regard to how we treat flora and fauna.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of the Environment: Does the Member accept  that although the use of snares is not the most desirable option, it is the  best option available? The Member said that other species may well go into a  snare, and they would be released within a 24-hour period under our proposal.  However, a bird of prey will certainly not go into a snare. Does the Member  recognise that if the use of poison is increased as a consequence of not having  snares, the biodiversity that exists in Northern Ireland will be  fundamentally damaged by moving away from snares? That would be a wholly  undesirable situation for Northern    Ireland.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Dr Farry: I understand the Minister&rsquo;s point. I regard  the use of poison to be indiscriminate, as is the use of snares. That is my  point: I do not advocate either.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Other, non-lethal traps and netting can be used to capture  animals that need to be controlled. I suggest that that is the better approach  to take. I accept that, in what we are debating today, there is a range of  options as to how we approach the use of snares. We intend to back those on a  progressive basis, but our ultimate preference would be a complete ban on the  use of snares. I believe that that is consistent with wider opinion in society.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Bell: There are some important matters to deal with,  and principal among them is the issue of snares. The juxtaposition on the  Benches opposite of opposing snares and supporting hare coursing has not been  lost in the context of the debate. The case for snares is similar to what  Winston Churchill said of democracy: that it is the worst form of government  apart from all the others. Are snares not the worst form of animal control  apart from all the others?</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I have never managed a farm. I have been on one many times,  but I have never managed one. I have never managed a game estate and never  seriously managed any significant piece of land, so I made it my business, as a  member of the Environment Committee, to check with those who manage farms and  game estates in my constituency and right across Northern Ireland, those whose job  it is to promote the wildlife in their area &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Wells: The honourable Member has made a similar  point. The group of people that he has interviewed is hardly a random sample.  If one is going to interview gamekeepers looking after estates, they will  hardly say that they are against snares. How many animal welfare organisations  did he consult? How many animal shelters that have to deal with the  consequences of the indiscriminate use of snares did he consult to get a more  unbiased viewpoint? He is getting the view that he wants to hear. That is not,  in my opinion, a cross-sample of views on this important issue.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Bell: Had the Member given me some time to develop  the argument, he would have learned that the animal welfare groups that I  consulted were very strong on the alternatives: no poison. The Minister has  outlined why the alternatives are wrong. The Member, in his intervention, did not  offer an alternative. Nobody particularly wants to snare an animal, but it is a  necessary evil.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am talking about people in a farming situation who manage  significant tracts of land. They have told me that it will be physically  impossible to manage that land without snares. If anyone has a better  alternative, as I said of Churchill and democracy, let us hear it today,  because it has not been raised in the debate so far. There has been a lot of  rightful concern about animals but no alternative to effective land management.  Is anyone here stating &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Dr Farry: I am grateful to the Member for giving way. I  will throw out a suggestion about how we can try to marry these two debates: we  have evidence of the capture of the hare, which is a very elusive creature.  Could that practice be transferred to the regulation of animals such as foxes  that are the target of the snares?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: The  bottom line is that we have already seen twins mauled by foxes. I do not think  that there is any serious argument to be put for what the Member has given. Let  me develop it; let me hear it. I will give way now to anybody in the Chamber  who can tell me that they have a more effective and better means of land  management than snares.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Dr Farry: I made the point that it is possible to  design non-lethal traps or to use nets to catch animals. We need not use  something that locks itself around an animal&rsquo;s body and slowly strangles that  struggling animal to death. There are other ways to catch an animal. They may  be slightly more complicated and expensive, but, if that is the direction that  we want to take, they can be designed.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: Mr  Deputy Speaker, for the purpose of the debate, apart from being a figment of  his imagination, will the Member provide the evidence base for what he has just  said? I mean the actual evidence base involving a land manager who has put out  60 to 70 of these &ldquo;netty&rdquo; traps, or whatever they are, which proved more  effective than snares?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Dr Farry: It is good that we are at least having a  debate on the issue. How can there be an evidence base when land managers have  the legal option of using snares? They will use what is available and what is  easier from their point of view, rather than what is best for animal welfare or  in the interests of biodiversity. Until snares are regulated, we cannot build  up an evidence base for the use of alternative methods.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Bell: My father taught me that if one gives his  opponents enough rope, they will sometimes hang themselves.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Wells: Like snares?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Bell: Please, I will generally give way when people  ask.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I asked the Member for the evidence base for more effective  alternatives to snares and, by his own mouth, he admitted that he does not have  one. Scotland,  which operates one of the most liberal regimes, uses the snare system as well.  The allegation is being put about the Chamber that people who use snares to  manage their land effectively are doing so because they are cruel and are  interested in seeing animals harmed. They do it because it is the most  effective way &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Wells: I really will have to refute that. The Member  may be confusing the comments made about hare coursing with those made about  snaring. No one is suggesting for one moment that a gamekeeper or a landowner  is going out to snare animals for enjoyment or to derive any sadistic pleasure.  Some argue that it is a necessary evil. I am sure that they do not enjoy doing  it, but I have heard nobody on any side of the House suggest that snaring is  done for fun.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Bell: I am glad that that is clarified. So, we have  clarified that, basically, the people who are setting snares, and will be  laying and checking them this evening, are doing so because they are  responsible and are mainly from farming communities. Today, one person told me  that to protect chickens, and believe me, when foxes get at chickens we are  into a question of animal welfare &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McKay: The Committee carried out a consultation on  the Bill, and by the time the consultation deadline had passed, the Ulster  Farmers&rsquo; Union had forwarded no comments about  snares. That shows how seriously the farming community takes this issue.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Bell: The point is that the farming community does not  take the issue of snaring seriously or they would oppose my position. That is a  debate that I am quite happy to call with the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union,  and the evidence base for that is that I have spoken to farmers, which the  Member would have known had he listened to me earlier. Without exception, that  is what farmers told me.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, we have established two things in the debate.  First, we have established that no better option than hare coursing has  evidence-based approval. We have talked about nets and traps and all those  things, but the reality is that we have established that there is no other  effective means &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Wells: Just to correct the Member: he did actually  say that there was no other option but hare coursing. I think he meant snaring.  I genuinely think he is mixing up the two arguments here.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Bell: I will come to that, and I thank the Member  for pointing out that &mdash; point. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We have established two things. First, with the exception  of snaring, there is no other effective means of trapping animals. Secondly,  every other means proposed, from poisoning onwards, is more detrimental to  wildlife, will cause wildlife more pain and will affect birds of prey that  earlier in the debate we said we wanted to protect.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In that situation, the case is unassailable. Although  snares may be a bad form of pest control, they are better than all the  alternatives. I daresay that if a comprehensive analysis could be carried out  on the views of everyone managing significant tracts of land tonight, we would  realise that snaring is the most effective means to deal with the problem at  hand.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">6.45 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The case for using snares has been comprehensively made, so  I shall turn to the second issue &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> I  am sorry; I thought that the Member wanted me to give way.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I have talked to landowners, game estate owners, chicken  farmers and farmers throughout Strangford and Tyrone, and, without exception,  they argue that the snare is the most effective and least harmful means of pest  control. That is why the Minister&rsquo;s measure is the most effective way to  address people&rsquo;s genuine concerns.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Let me be clear: the so-called park coursing that Mr Wells  described will receive no support from me. However, let us also be sure that  the facts do not get in the way of the argument. I have never been park  coursing, nor have I any intention of doing so. Having grown up in the  countryside, I feel that it is wrong to interfere unnecessarily in people&rsquo;s  legitimate way of life. Therefore, I listened to the evidence, which is all  that I can do in a situation that I do not know about. The evidence is clear:  today&rsquo;s park coursing bears no resemblance to the traumatic events that Mr  Wells described. Nowadays, greyhounds are muzzled. Mr Wells said that a hare  can die from being hit by a muzzle, but I have no figures for that. If he has  research that shows the percentage of hares that die in such a way, I will  gladly give way.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Wells: My evidence is based on statistics provided  by the Irish Coursing Club, which admits that, on average, at any given meet,  two or three hares are killed as the result of being hit by a muzzle. Granted,  that is fewer than would be killed without a muzzle &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Bell: Out of a total of?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Wells: There could be anything from 20 to 30 races  or even more. I am not saying for one moment that the percentage is high.  However, even if not a single hare is killed, it is still unacceptable.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Bell: According to Mr Wells&rsquo;s argument, 90% of the  hares that are involved in hare coursing are allowed to escape to their natural  environment, in accordance with Irish wildlife regulations.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Let us look further at the evidence. My colleague Mr Weir  made some lurid analogies about being chased by dogs. I shall say something  different. Rather than coming up with lurid analogies, I shall look at research  from Queen&rsquo;s University. Is it not the case that Queen&rsquo;s University  commissioned its independent environmental &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Wells: Will the Member give way?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Bell: Yes, I will.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Wells: I see that the honourable Member is reading  from an Irish Coursing Club script. That is another example of the so-called  unbiased evidence that that gentleman is putting forward. Could he find  anything more biased than the Irish Coursing Club? At least he should try to  see the other person&rsquo;s point of view. He should speak to those who have  witnessed the cruelty of coursing. I assure him that he will not get that  information from Clonmel.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Bell: I thought that the Member said &ldquo;Cromwell&rdquo;. My  evidence does come from the Irish Coursing Club, but it refers to independent  environmental research on hares by Quercus at Queen&rsquo;s University.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The difference between my intervention and that of Mr Wells  is that I present current evidence, not a historical trauma of 30 years ago.  The DEFRA report clearly shows that the banning of regulated coursing caused a  dramatic increase in the poaching of the hare population in England. It was  identified as the most prolific wildlife crime. Compare and contrast that with  the Irish Coursing Club&rsquo;s hare husbandry programme. Do not take my word, or the  word of my beautiful assistant who is holding up the Irish Coursing Club visual  aid, for that. Take the word of Quercus at Queen&rsquo;s University, which researched  hare populations in the Republic   of Ireland.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Where the Irish Coursing Club practises its hare husbandry  programme, the presence of a robust Irish hare population is not equally  likely, twice as likely or even 10 times as likely as in other areas. It is 18  times more likely that the population of the hare is protected. If a dog  attacks an innocent animal for pure entertainment and that animal squeals, that  is one argument, and I contest that it has already been won. However, evidence  from Queen&rsquo;s University is that the hare population is 18 times more likely to  survive through the hare husbandry programme. Is that programme not a better  form of animal welfare than that which exists?</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We have heard that people who take part in park coursing do  so based on bloodlust, and they have been demonised. Is everyone talking about  the same activity? My understanding is that park coursing involves two muzzled  greyhounds pursuing a hare for less than 60 seconds in an enclosed field, in  which the hare has already been trained to run to a provided escape. The  objective is not to kill the hare and, in over 90% of cases, even by Mr Wells&rsquo;s  admission, hares are returned to the Irish countryside in keeping with the  Irish wildlife regulations. That gives rise to a significantly different argument.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I listened to Mr Beggs and Dr Farry talking about banning  sport that causes some form of physical pain and trauma to an animal. In that  case, they would ban fishing. Contrary to Dr Farry&rsquo;s mistaken belief, the vast  majority of angling is not for food, but for sport. A barbed hook is put into a  fish&rsquo;s mouth, and when an angler catches a fish, the barb prevents it from  escaping. The fish is then suspended on a line from a reel that is often  operated hydraulically. The fish is then dragged out of its natural  environment, the oxygenated water, and is caused significant pain, trauma and  torture. Will those Members ban fishing as well?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Wells: I am getting very tired of the honourable  Member&rsquo;s arguments, but I will deal with them during my speech. If he were to  follow his illogical argument, where would he have stood on bear-baiting,  badger-baiting and cockfighting? Exactly the same arguments could have been  made: if cockfighting were banned, what about fishing? Had we been debating  those issues, where would the Member have stood? Surely there is a dividing  line between what is acceptable to the public as a necessary evil and what  constitutes cruelty. Where would he draw that line?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Bell: There are two things. First, with regard to  bear-baiting and such like, although it does not need to be placed on the  record, if the Member wants to know my position, I will state it: I am  absolutely against it, but I suspect that he knows that already. If the Member  is getting tired of my arguments, I will let him rest and not give way to him  so much. The point that I was making, and the point that he failed to answer,  is whether the same principles are being applied to fishing. The only  difference is that Members do not have the courage to follow the course of  their argument.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In fishing, people dangle bait in front of a hungry animal,  with the express purpose of trapping that animal by putting it on a hook and  causing it physical injury. The barb then causes the fish additional physical  injury as it struggles to escape and is held more tightly. The fish is then  hung out of its natural environment, it is usually weighed for a significant  period, and it is then thrown back into the sea traumatised with physical  injury and with no opportunity for counselling.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">If we going to start making those clear arguments, there  cannot be sport. Mr Weir made the argument about equality of arms and weakness  of argument. Taking cognisance of the fact that he is the Chief Whip of the  party, I will not respond too forcefully on that issue.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Storey: Remember Declan.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Bell: Remember Declan, indeed.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">If a case is to be made that sport takes place only through  some form of equality of arms, as a barrister would state, do the fish have to  be on a par with the fisherman, or does the animal have to be of a similar  calibre to the gun that it is being shot with? Where do we start to draw in  those conclusions?</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We need to be expressly clear that we have established that  snaring is a necessary evil; that there is no alternative that will help to  manage the environment; and that any proposed alternative will hurt animals,  cause them additional pain and suffering and create additional degradation of  the wildlife and the natural environment. That is why the amendment to regulate  the system of snares is appropriate.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We must ask ourselves whether we go with what happened to  hare coursing 30 years ago, which is, effectively, finished, or whether we go  with the reality of what happens today, where, as a result of the hare  husbandry programme, a hare has an 18 times greater chance of success and 90%  of them will be chased for less than 60 seconds by two muzzled dogs to an  escape route and returned to the natural wildlife environment as is legislated  for through Irish wildlife regulations. In that case, the people who are  involved in the latter are doing it out of genuine interests, in the same way  that fishermen do it, which is for their sport. However, Members will not  attack the fishermen because they know that, if they were to do so, they would  not be here after the next election.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is the same principle as there being a limited amount of  cruelty and pain in fishing, in the same way as there is a limited amount of  cruelty in hare coursing for the same outcome. Therefore, if Members are  genuine, and they are stating that any sort of activity that causes physical  injury or psychological trauma is to be banned, they should put that in their  manifestos. I will wish them well as I say goodbye to them at the next  election.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Members should have the courage of their argument and  follow it through, or they should not. However, if sport is to be allowed, it  should be regulated. If someone can tell me how we have a better system here  today for the hare as opposed to the evidence of Queen&rsquo;s University and  Quercus, which shows that the hare is 18 times more likely to survive in the  Republic, I wait to hear it.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McKay: I am in favour of the Environment Committee&rsquo;s  move to ban snares outright. Retaining the use of snares was not an issue that  we had been lobbied strongly on when compared with the issues of hare coursing  and keeping birds, etc, which have also been included in the Bill. Of course,  the majority of respondents to the consultation opposed snares.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Those groups included the Animal Welfare Federation, the  League Against Cruel Sports, Lecale Conservation, and the Environmental Link,  which consists of many environmental organisations. Indeed, only two groups &mdash;  the British Association for Shooting and Conservation and the Countryside  Alliance &mdash; indicated that they wanted to retain snares.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">7.00 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As Stephen Farry said earlier, snaring is completely  indiscriminate. If Members have done their research for the debate today they  will have seen many horrific photographs of cats, dogs and other domestic pets  that have been caught up in them. The use of snares is not common throughout  most of the rest of Europe, and Ireland  and Britain  are two of the last countries to retain their use. In the Czech  Republic, the use of wire snares is  banned and the nature protection Act in Poland bans the use of snares  there.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is clear from recently released evidence that snares are  being set by gamekeepers and others across the North in violation of codes of  practice. It is not a big issue for the farming community and there has been a  degree of scaremongering by the Ulster Unionist Party and Mr Beggs today.  Indeed, the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union has stated  that:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the use of snares is not considered to be a common  farming practice&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union  also suggest that snares are not used in sheep farming, despite what Members  from the Ulster Unionist Party have said today, and it has repeated that view  during radio interview since.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wells referred to how unacceptable it would if a cat or  dog were to be coursed or chased around a field. Why is it acceptable for  snares to be put in places that can trap cats and dogs? In some cases, wire  nooses tighten around an animal&rsquo;s neck cutting open the animal&rsquo;s throat and  choking it in a torturous way. It is absolutely inhumane, and not part &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of the Environment: Does the Member accept  that that we are not debating those types of snares, but snares with stops? The  Member is confusing the debate and is not dealing with the issue under  discussion.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McKay: Mr Bell, a Member for Strangford referred to  the so-called liberal regime in Scotland,  and something similar is proposed here. If Members have done their research for  the debate they will have found some quite horrific examples of the damage that  has been done to animals by snares. If Members Google &ldquo;snaring&rdquo; they will find  images of dead cats and dogs and snared animal skeletons. Scotland has a  so-called liberal regime, yet a number of dogs have been caught in snares there  and have had a great deal of damage done to them. One such example occurred in  Forres in northern Scotland  where there is a law that snares must be checked every 24 hours. A Mr Powney  said that he had:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the unenviable task of finding and removing my young  daughter&rsquo;s pet cat , which was found dead, strangled and hanging in a rabbit  snare, set on a fence only 50 metres from my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He added that:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The worst thing was that we could see it from the  garden&hellip; My daughter was absolutely devastated when she found out.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There are other cases, including one in which another poor  creature was almost cut in two by a snare, but was still alive when found by a  doctor. When the doctor touched it, its heart fell out still beating before it  died. Those are the realities of snaring and what can and does happen. The  Minister can screw up his face all the likes, but that is the reality and a  fact.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Some local shooting estates have been extremely  irresponsible with snares. Indeed, in one of the most significant finds in many  years, one club was found to have set 22 snares set along a single fence line  this year. It is a problem that involves a small number of people, and humane  alternatives are available to them. The public wants to see this practice  brought to an end.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Shannon: I will speak on the third group of  amendments, which deal with snares, control of animal populations and game. As  a member of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, I am aware  that when representatives of the League Against Cruel Sports attended the  Committee, they could provide no statistical evidence that snares had been used  inhumanely in Northern    Ireland. That was interesting, because  although that body has data from across the water, it is recorded in the  Hansard report that the organisation could not provide evidence about Northern Ireland  when we asked it to provide it. That says a lot.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">On two occasions, Mr McKay asked about the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union. Departmental officials contacted the Ulster  Farmers&rsquo; Union, and its initial reply was as  the Member said. However, after that organisation carried out exhaustive  research among its members, it told the Committee that a number of its members  used snaring. They did not use snaring in large numbers, but a number of them  did. I give that information to be accurate about the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union, of which I declare an interest as a member.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 8 to 15 deal with snaring, which can be a  controversial issue. Numerous respondents have contacted me on the matter. I  have been contacted by not one, two, three or 10 people but by dozens upon  dozens of people. It is important that we make the information available on  what modern snaring entails, because Members need to know that. Modern snaring  is a skilful, selective and humane method of capturing and restraining target  animals for dispatch. It is important that we support the Minister&rsquo;s proposal,  because properly set snares should not kill. A modern snare is free running,  and it allows the snare to loosen and any non-target species to be released. The  modern snare has a permanent stop fitted to prevent complete closure. The  Minister said that on a couple of occasions, and a couple of other Members said  the same.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Snaring allows the control of foxes at crucial times of the  year, especially at this time of year. Indeed, just last night, one of my  farmer friends informed me that, on Saturday, he had to call in someone to  control the foxes and that that person dispatched three. At this time of year,  when the fox cubs are out, fox numbers are up. They take a significant toll on  wildlife. In that case, it was on that gentleman&rsquo;s chickens and bantams, and he  was concerned about that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Other Members mentioned foxes, and it is important that we  control them. Snaring is a humane method of doing so, and it is important that  that opportunity be given through the regulated system that the Minister  indicated will do just that. I have witnessed, and I have talked to other  people who have witnessed, what happens whenever a fox gets into a chicken coop  or a duck pen. I do not know whether other Members have witnessed that. The fox  kills all around him, and that is his method of looking after the pen.  Therefore, foxes have to be controlled.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In spring and early summer, the vegetation and crops are  often too tall to allow effective control through shooting, so snaring provides  an effective method of control to protect ground-nesting birds such as curlew,  which other Members spoke about strongly, and their offspring at that  vulnerable time. In certain environments, the snare is often the only efficient  and effective management option. In answer to an intervention, the Minister  mentioned Glenwherry estate, where 600 foxes were dispatched. The result of  that is that curlew, red grouse, snipe and lapwing numbers have increased. Sometimes,  an imbalance in nature has to be controlled, and the use of snares is one way  to do that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The red grouse, the lapwing and the godwit are examples of  the ground-nesting birds that are included as priority species in the Northern Ireland  biodiversity strategy, which everyone spoke in favour of earlier. Everyone also  spoke in favour of biodiversity in the countryside. Snares provide a vital  management option for the control of those vulnerable species. That has already  been accepted in Scotland,  and the new system was introduced there some months ago. The Minister&rsquo;s  proposals for here are clear and are suitable for the countryside and the rural  community, and, importantly, they regulate the system.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The future of the red grouse and the other species that form  a part of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  biodiversity will require the control of foxes, and, undoubtedly, the loss of  snaring will increase the pressure on those already vulnerable populations. To  protect rural jobs, the rural sector and the biodiversity of Northern Ireland,  snares need a future. Members talked about bad practice &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment:  Will the Member give way?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Shannon: I am happy to give way.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment:  Foxes aside, we are talking about an added snare. Mr Wells talked about the  stress caused to animals in hare coursing and the stress experienced by an  animal, no matter what type of animal, when caught in a trap for 12 or 24  hours. What is the difference? Can you clarify that?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Shannon: I am not in the business of clarifying  anything on behalf of Mr Wells. He can clarify his own issues. As far as I am  concerned, the snaring process can be regulated as the Minister has proposed,  and the snares can be checked every 12 or 24 hours. I know lots of gamekeepers  who regularly check their traps and snares, and they have released some animals  that were not supposed to be there. However, it is important that we have  control over rabbits, weasels and even mink, because they can be very  destructive animals as well.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">A mechanism is required to raise standards in Northern Ireland.  That is important. We are looking at a better methodology to regulate snaring  and to professionalise the use of snares for necessary wildlife management in Northern Ireland.  The BASC already provides a snaring accreditation course, which is currently  being run successfully in Scotland.  They have shown how to do it correctly there, and I believe that Northern Ireland  should adopt that industry-led approach. I would approve of legislation for  snaring similar to that in Scotland.  I also approve of the regulated system that the Minister has put forward. If it  is a good system and it is regulated, it can work. There will always be  examples of where it has fallen down, but it is getting better. It is a matter  of putting in place the legislation to improve snaring and to do it better.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The skills of the individual who sets the snares are  essential in minimising welfare problems and the capture of non-target species.  Legislation in Northern    Ireland should require those wishing to use  a snare to be trained. I hope that that will happen through all this  legislative change. An accredited course should be developed with the approval  of the Northern Ireland Assembly and delivered by the shooting, conservation  and farming sector. There are methods through which that can be done. The cost  of the course development and its delivery should be shared by those wishing to  use the snares. In other words, those who are licensed to do so should pay for  that course and deliver the system as put forward.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">To provide accountability, legislation should require  snares to be tagged. That is a clear condition of what the Minister is saying.  The tags will display a unique user identification number, and the tag number  will be issued to an individual only on completion of the accredited snaring  course. Again, the systems need to be in place to ensure that snares are  controlled and looked after.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is suggested that the legislation should specify how  snares should be designed and used and that snares have to be fitted with  effective stops to prevent full closure. Again, it comes back to the system  that the Minister is putting forward, which will improve the snaring process  and ensure that it is acceptable. I believe that that will allay a lot of  people&rsquo;s fears. Future legislation should also require snares to be checked to  ensure that they are free running and checked at least once every 24 hours, or,  as has been suggested, once every 12 hours. I know gamekeepers who check their  snares every 12 hours. Snares must have an effective anchor to prevent them  from being dragged. Snares should never be set on or near features that could  result in animals being fully or partially suspended or drowned.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Decision-making on snaring in Northern Ireland must be made in  light of all available science. Let us base this debate on snaring on the facts  of the case. DEFRA has commissioned research, which is due to conclude very  shortly. That research looks at, among other things, the humaneness of snares.  Every effort should be made to examine that work and to ensure that policy  decisions on snaring in Northern    Ireland do not conflict with modern  research.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I support amendment Nos 8, 9 and 10 as sensible approaches  to snaring that allow for regulation but not persecution of those who wish to  use snares in the right way. Let us regulate snaring, let us control it, and  let us have a system that can work. As regards amendment Nos 11 and 12, I  support the comments that BASC has made, which I have already outlined, about  checking snares every 24 hours. I support amendment No 13, because I believe  that snaring is only, and should only, be carried out for the correct and  proper reasons, such as pest control, which the Department must recognise. The  Minister and, I believe, most Members, even those who are sceptical, recognise  the fact that there is a need for pest control, particularly for foxes. It is  important that that happens. Importantly, amendment No 15 defines that clearly.  I fully support the new clause that is proposed in amendment No 16.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">7.15 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is essential that, through all the amendments that  relate to snaring legislation, the use of snares is regulated and appropriate  and that people who use snares still have the freedom to use their skills to  control the land. That is what gamekeepers  do: they control the land and the vermin on it and ensure that it is looked  after. BASC and the Countryside Alliance reached that compromise with the  Department, and I fully support such an accommodation.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I also support amendment Nos 17 and 18. I support the  Minister&rsquo;s desire to omit clause 15, which relates to shooting deer from a  vehicle, and of the inclusion of the new clause that is proposed in amendment  No 19. I also support the Minister&rsquo;s decision to change the date of the deer  season from April to March, which is sensible, logical and practical. That is  what those amendments offer.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I must stand against amendment Nos 26, 49 and 50, which  refer to hare coursing. Hare coursing is a test of speed and agility. Dogs are  muzzled, and hares are coursed only once. People who are involved in the  activity say that hares are taken back to the areas from which they were  originally taken. We can talk about the past and what was wrong with the former  system, but a modern, sensible system is now in place.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Coursing clubs worked closely with Queen&rsquo;s University on a  number of groundbreaking research projects. Professor Ian Montgomery is on  record as saying that his research would be impossible without the enthusiastic  participation of coursing clubs, and, clearly, he could not have obtained the  required information without their co-operation. That research confirms that  coursing does not have any negative effect on hare populations. The hare  population is growing, and that must be recognised.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Irish Coursing Club has more than 2,000 licensed  trainers, and more than 22,000 greyhounds are registered annually. That makes  coursing an important rural business, on which the proposal to ban coursing  would have an adverse effect. Therefore, I cannot support amendment Nos 49 and  50.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I support amendment Nos 43, 44, 46, 47 and 51, among  others, and I urge Members to support them. I also urge Members not to back the  amendments that I do not support.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Kinahan: I am pleased to speak in the debate. I  started with a nice clean set of logical notes. However, after listening to the  debate and going round in circles, I hope that my comments will follow  logically. At the start of the process, I said that we would have to be careful  not to become emotional and get carried away. We are here to listen to good  clean debate and make our decisions.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">When the Bill initially came before the Committee, I, like  my colleague, was of a mind to ban snares. Indeed, at that time, we were not  lobbied much by the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union or  others. Subsequently, I have probably received more e-mails on that topic than  on almost any other subject. All of them came in after that event.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">When snares are properly controlled, they are a necessary  evil. The alternatives include lamping, which involves people going out with  guns late at night; shooting, which is not necessarily an easy course of action  for people who are on the urban border with the countryside; ferreting, which  is another reasonable way to catch pests, although some people may not like it;  and hunting, although another 100 packs of dogs would probably be needed to  control all the foxes in Ireland. Therefore, snaring is one tool.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Today, we should support the use of snares as long as they  copy best practice from places such as Scotland. Snaring needs to be  licensed in such a way that people will not be permitted to buy a snare unless  they have passed a course and know what they are doing.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I say that snares are necessary from my own experience. I  have lost all my hens and ducks on three occasions and two or three deer. Foxes  will kill. They will take away as many creatures as they can, and they will  store them. Foxes are very organised. There are many of them, and we must control  them. At the same time, we have heard from others who say that foxes eat grouse  and curlew. It is our job to try to regulate the balance of nature as best we  can. I feel that we must, therefore, keep the snare as one of our tools. I  support amendment No 8.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I move now to spring traps. My initial instinct, again, was  that they were awful, but then I remembered the horror of going to the zoo  here. It was not the animals in cages that horrified me, but the 150 magpies  that descended at feeding time. Think about the damage that the magpie does to  nesting birds, eggs and everything else, and what a sly creature it is. If an  individual follows a pattern to shoot a magpie one day, the magpie will  remember that pattern the next day, and it will disappear the moment that the  individual opens the door again. The magpie learns very quickly; it is one of  the birds that need to be trapped. The Larsen trap, which is one of the spring  traps, is an ideal way to catch magpies. It is not nice, because the bird is in  the trap and someone has to catch it and wring its neck. However, we are not  here to talk about whether it is nice; we are here because we want to control.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I move on to hare coursing. It is the subject which brought  out all the emotion today, but that is the wrong way to deal with the issue.  Rules have been introduced in Ireland  with regard to muzzling, catching the hare, letting it out only once and  allowing the hare to get out at the far end. One colleague asked, with a smile,  whether there was an exit sign. There is probably a sign in Irish. All those  measures are sensible. It is all there and is designed to let those people who  want to enjoy the countryside, in their way, carry on enjoying it. I am  uncomfortable with banning hare coursing, but it is not perfect. It is on the  other side of the coin. When we draw our line, I feel that we have to leave the  ban on hare coursing in place until we have found better ways of letting people  enjoy it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The House was sidetracked when the issue of betting at hare  coursing was mentioned. That is a different debate. I plead with Members to  look at things logically and straight. Get rid of the emotion, think of what we  are trying to do, and then we will get the best results.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. It is late in the hour, so I will  not go into a long-winded debate. There are important issues that we have to  deal with. There is no whip in relation to this particular matter. I oppose the  legislation. Angela Smith introduced the legislation some time ago, and I  oppose it today in relation to hare coursing and on the lines of trying to  complete protection of the Irish hare. The hunting fraternity believes that  this is the thin end of the wedge, but some of our  people-who-like-to-be-good-to-everything brigade want a nice, cosy situation.  This is the thin end of the wedge. First, they want to introduce the protection  of the Irish hare, and then they will say that, if the Irish hare is protected,  there should not be any hunts, because the hounds will not know which hare is  an Irish hare and which is a brown hare. There has to be some form of  demarcation.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We have to deal with the coursing as it is at the moment,  not along the lines of the emotion that Mr Wells and others have gone through  in the past. I thought that they would have got over the trauma at this stage,  because it seems that they have looked on for the past 30 years in this  situation.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is better that hare coursing be controlled and regulated  than banned. If Mr Wells and others believe that hare coursing does not happen  because there is a ban on it, they are living in cloud cuckoo land. The same  applies to cockfighting, for instance. If they think that that does not happen  in the countryside, they are badly misled.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Wells: Perhaps the Member can give us the view of  the Minister of Agriculture on the issue. She has said, both publicly and  privately, that she is appalled by hare coursing. Can he confirm that?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Molloy: I cannot confirm that at all. I do not know  what the situation is in relation to that. I know the reality of the situation  on the ground.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">By regulation and control, any situation can be managed.  There is already quite a bit of regulation on hare coursing; there is the  muzzling and allowing the hare to escape. I know that there are people on the  opposite Benches &mdash; not all, but some &mdash; who would ban all types of betting on  sport, whatever it may be. [Interruption.] Ban it, yes. They would probably ban  horse racing and greyhound racing because of betting and gambling. There is a  certain section of people who would want that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The exhaustion of the hare has been mentioned. However,  when I watched the Grand National, I saw that the riders brought the horses  back exhausted. Does that mean that horses should not be raced any longer? One  can see that, when a horse is racing, it enjoys the race, and the same goes for  greyhound racing. We need to be careful that we do not create a cotton-wool  community in which we protect everything so much that we cannot do anything at  all.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The rural way of life is being jeopardised by a small  number of people sitting in cloud-cuckoo land and making decisions for everyone  else. Hare coursing has been controlled in the past and it can be controlled  now. It is a major way of controlling the sport, and we must look at how we  create an industry around it. Greyhound racing in the South of Ireland is a  major industry, as is horse racing. We can deal with hare coursing if we manage  and control a lot of these things.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The statistics show that in areas where coursing happens,  the Irish hare population has increased, and in areas where there is no hare  coursing whatsoever, there is no sign of an increase. That is happening because  the hares are protected. The people who manage that structure are managing the  hares and ensuring that infection and disease are eradicated. The people who work  in the various sports and structures around that actually do look after those  who are involved in it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to get into the issue of snares in any great  way. However, it is typical of the approach that people have in a lot of these  situations that they collect the fox or they collect these animals. What do  they do with them then? Mr Kinahan said that he had to wring the necks of birds  caught in traps the next day. What would he do with a fox? Would he hit it over  the head with something? Would he shoot it? Is one method more humane than  another? The collecting of animals in a box and putting them through the trauma  of being trapped is the same as the exhaustion of the hare that Mr Wells was  talking about, if we look along the lines of the hunting process that is  involved.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The people who are behind the amendments are the same  people who, later on in the year, will come forward with a motion to ban  hunting completely. This is the thin end of the wedge. They are preparing the  ground for a private Member&rsquo;s Bill that will ban hunting completely. We need to  be very careful that we do not introduce legislation in a small way that will  be used by those who wish to ban hunting completely, because that is their  intention.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Foxes are overrunning parts of the countryside. People who  normally keep chickens and fowl and one thing and another in their back gardens  have stopped doing so. The game that is naturally running about the fields &mdash;  pheasants and things like that &mdash; are being wiped out because of the number of  foxes. At some stage, we may have to return to offering a bounty for foxes. We  will have to pay people to catch and kill foxes and bring them in.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is an angle that we have to look at. We have  the figures from Mr Wells on the number of hares that are killed by a dog  hitting a hare with its muzzle. That is nearly as difficult an action as  catching a hare. I do not know how a dog is trained to know that hitting a hare  with its muzzle will kill it; it seems to be an accident. We do not have the  figures on the number of hares or badgers killed by cars on the road, but  should we ban cars from the roads completely? Do we need some means of  protecting animals completely, so that nothing can be killed?</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">7.30 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wells said that fish were killed suddenly. Why do we  throw them back into the river again, if they are dead? If they die suddenly  because they have been fished out of the water, why throw them back into the  river? Is that just so that other fish can eat them? Are we dealing with  cannibalism, in a sense? We need to look at the reality of the world today, not  the ideal world that some people would have. We have a good piece of  legislation and this amendment detracts from it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">People have suspicions about why the hare was included and  concerns about what the long-term plans are. We need to look at what is the  best way of protecting the Irish hare. We have proved time and again that the  best way of protecting a species is to manage the situation and to create the  right environment so that we do not have a situation in which there is no  control whatsoever and nobody looking after the hare, so that the population  simply disintegrates. Let us not destroy a good piece of legislation by  including a number of small items that can damage it in the future.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, we discussed the issue of people fishing for food  and anglers fishing for sport. Fishing is in sporting magazines, so it is not  about survival. The sport is simply about catching a fish, reeling it in and  then throwing it back in the water again. We also have the situation in which  we are being told that coursing is wrong, but course fishing is OK. Mr Wells  comes from Kilkeel and, there, fish are not just fished by a rod and a line,  they are fished in big nets and rolled in. The fish are not even humanely  killed. They are killed by the loss of air when they are rolled onto a big  boat. However, we all like to eat them for tea, and there is nothing wrong with  that part of it. As another Member said, Mr Wells&rsquo;s thinking might be that a  lot of people in his constituency who vote for him are involved in that  process, so he would not like to go against it, but let me tell you that there  are as many people right across the country who are involved in hunting and  rural sports and who might decide to look at all Members&rsquo; positions on that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, let us look at the legislation that we have and  how we can protect the rural way of life and rural sports, rather than trying  to create an ideal world, in which nothing can be dealt with and that is  overrun with foxes and other vermin. The European Union is talking about  banning bait for rats, so we could have a situation in which we cannot put down  any kind of bait for them. Where do we stop in that kind of situation?</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we deal with the reality of what we  have today. Despite what Mr Wells said, ours was an ardchomhairle &mdash; a national  executive &mdash; motion that was adopted at the ard fheis. It was not decided simply  on the lines of what one party member who may have some knowledge of the matter  said. One member would not represent the views of everyone. There were several  constituencies across Ireland from which the same types of motions were coming,  aiming to ensure that we protect the rural way of life, do not destroy it and  create the environment where people will come to this country to participate in  those sports, rather than killing it off and destroying it.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  The night is young; it is only 7.30 pm. It is fascinating to see what happens  when the shackles of the five-minute rule are thrown off and Members can  express themselves. What makes this even more unique, apart from the Members  opposite, is that it is amazing to see what happens when Members are given the  freedom to say exactly what they want to say, to vote in whichever Lobby they  wish to, and have the opportunity to listen to the arguments made and base  their decision on the viewpoints expressed by various Members. I have to say  that nothing that I have heard this evening and this afternoon has changed my  view one iota, but I am sure that for others it has been a very interesting  experience. It is only half past seven, and I understand that the canteen is  open until midnight, so we have plenty of time to deal with these important issues  and to take some crucial votes later on.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">First, I want to deal with the issue of hare coursing. I  congratulate the Member for East Antrim Mr Beggs for bringing the amendment  forward. I made the point to the Minister during Second Stage that, in 30  years&rsquo; time, he may not be known for some obscure amendment that he made to the  RPA Bill, or some issue that he dealt with on the redeployment of planners &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Because he did not.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: He  did not, but at the time when I made that point, he could have. He may well be  remembered as the Minister who ended the barbaric practice of park hare  coursing. Equally, the Member for East Antrim  could go down in history as the person who delivered that much-needed change in  legislation.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I emphasise that we are talking about park-enclosed hare  coursing, within a confined space. We need to differentiate that from open hare  coursing, which is practised in England.  In 1972, Mr McConnell, who was then an MP in this House, tried to bring in  legislation to ban hare coursing. He got through several readings successfully,  and the reason why the legislation failed is that the Northern Ireland  Parliament collapsed. Similarly, in 1974, Lord Dunleath, the Alliance Member  for what is now North Down &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Also Alliance.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Also Alliance,  yes. He was within days of getting legislation through to ban park hare  coursing. Guess what happened? The Assembly collapsed in 1974. In 1986, in the  Assembly that I was part of &mdash; the 1982-86 Prior Assembly &mdash; I was working hard  to bring in legislation to ban hare coursing, and guess what happened? That  Assembly collapsed. I do not for one moment want to think that Mr Beggs&rsquo;s  proposed amendment is going to bring this place collapsing down around our  ears, but it is interesting that we would have had a ban on hare coursing long  ago had it not been for three fates of history, and no one would have missed  it. It would have been gone forever, and been completely unlamented.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">If the proposed ban on park hare coursing does not succeed  tonight, it will not be on the strength of the argument, or because of public  opinion, as 73% of the population have said that they want an end to it. It  will be because the honourable Member for Kerry North Mr Ferris, at a Sinn F&eacute;in  conference, proposed a motion opposing a ban on hare coursing. That then led to  a three-line whip on the Members opposite. I know, from private information  that I have, that many of them personally, including the Minister of  Agriculture, if given a free vote here tonight, would vote for a ban on hare  coursing.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The issue that I have to put to the honourable &mdash; not  honourable, but the Members opposite &mdash; is that no one is going to tell me that  all 26 of them, or 25, as Mr McHugh has left, who, on conscience, have  considered the issue and weighed up the balance, would come to the same opinion  that hare coursing is a good thing. Some of them are educated, some of them  have gone through university, some of them are females &mdash; I see that Ms Anderson  the Member for Foyle has come in. I know that, in their own heart of hearts, if  they were given a free vote on it, they would vote to ban park hare coursing.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Not one of them has been prepared to stand up and put hand  on heart, including the Chairperson of the Environment Committee, and say that  a year ago, they would not have voted for the amendment. They would have voted  for a ban on hare coursing, but now they have been whipped by the Sinn F&eacute;in  machine, which has ordered them not to support it under any circumstances, even  though it has support from Members throughout the House. Is it not sad that  that barbaric practice may be allowed to continue in Northern Ireland simply because of  the activities of Mr Ferris, who does not even live in the same country? He is  hundreds of miles away in County   Kerry.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s fixation with Sinn F&eacute;in and its practices is quite admirable. If  he wants to do a study of Sinn F&eacute;in, I will certainly help him with the  research. However, his argument does not carry weight with Mr Shannon or Mr  Bell. People across the Floor have varying views on hare coursing, and some of  them are very emotionally held. Sinn F&eacute;in, as my colleague Mr Molloy said,  accepted a motion at its national executive, its ardcomhairle. That went to an  ard fheis, which was attended by around 1,000 delegates, and was voted on and  passed. It is called democracy within a political party. The Member should try  it some time. Our position on the issue is crystal clear and will not change.  The Member can berate us all night, and I am happy to sit here until midnight  while he does so. What is the Member&rsquo;s viewpoint on banning a countryside sport  that provides an economic benefit, which is more important now than at any  other stage, to the rural community?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  The greyhound racing industry will continue regardless of whether there is park  hare coursing, because suitable alternatives are available, namely, Dunmore Park and another park in the borough of  Lisburn. People can train greyhounds there and race them using electronic  hares. Therefore, the suggestion that a ban on park hare coursing would lead to  redundancies is nonsense. For the past six years, there has not been park hare  coursing because of the special protection order, and there have been no redundancies  in that time. People simply moved across the border to the Irish Republic  to continue their sport.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I would like to hear one of the Members opposite say &mdash; they  will not respond to me because they are being whipped viciously on the issue &mdash;  that minds were changed by the decision that came about as result of Mr  Ferris&rsquo;s motion. However, their minds have not changed. They were against hare  coursing, and now they are being told what to think.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The difference between the Member&rsquo;s party and mine is that  the DUP has a free vote, which is unknown to Sinn F&eacute;in. In my party, Members  such as Mr Shannon will vote in favour of hare coursing, and wiser Members will  vote against it. Our free vote means that DUP Members will go through both  Lobbies tonight. The issue is an obvious one of conscience. We cannot turn it  into a party political imperative, requiring a vote one way or the other.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brady is sitting in the back row of the Benches. I know  him of old. In fact, I have known him for a very long time. Inside his head is  someone who would vote for better animal protection. However, he is squirming  because he knows that he would be in big trouble should he not follow the  diktat of his party Whip tonight.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">A great deal of nonsense has been spoken here tonight. It  was suggested that hare coursing is a traditional rural pastime that must be  protected at all costs, but, as has been pointed out, so were bear-baiting,  cockfighting and badger-baiting. Any reasonable person would find those  so-called sports totally unacceptable today. I asked Mr Bell the Member for  Strangford where he would have stood on those issues. He stated that we would  have voted in favour of banning them because they were no longer acceptable.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There must be some test of public opinion. What do the  public in Northern Ireland  consider to be an acceptable sport as opposed to a cruel one? At present, the  vast majority of the public in Northern    Ireland consider fishing to be an acceptable  sport. However, no thin end of the wedge argument applies in this instance.  None of the Members who spoke here tonight in favour of a ban on park hare  coursing remotely suggested that normal, legitimate field sports should be  touched. A couple of centuries ago, someone could have said that badger-baiting  could not be banned because that would have been the thin end of the wedge.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">However, that is nonsense, because certain activities  clearly cross the threshold of acceptability. If a cat were raced down the  enclosed space at Crebilly and hounded by two greyhounds, would that be acceptable?  No, it would not, and it is not acceptable for a hare to be treated in that  way. The test is whether people would allow their domestic pet to be treated in  that way, and the answer to that question would be an emphatic no.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I accept that I have been too hot-headed tonight, and  perhaps I have made mistakes at times. However, I and one other Member who is  here tonight have watched hare coursing. I have seen exactly what happens, and  it was a very nasty experience. On Christmas Day 1982, bookies and hundreds of  people were lined up along the course at Crebilly. The First Minister, Peter Robinson, the late Henry Dunleath and I were  also there. To my dying day, I will remember the agonised cries of hares being  ripped to pieces on that course as people cheered and took bets on the fate of  the animals. No one can tell me that, in the twenty-first century, it is an  acceptable sport. People may say that there have been changes. However, those  changes were enforced by the Irish Coursing Club through gritted teeth, and it  had to be pulled through the hedges to implement them. That club had no  intention of making those changes until public opinion forced it to do so.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I accept that, as a result of those changes, far fewer  hares are killed. However, I am not making this an argument about the  population or conservation of the Irish hare. Whether or not there is coursing  in this part of the United Kingdom  or in the Republic   of Ireland, it will make  no difference to the overall population of the Irish hare. That is not the  issue. It is a moral issue. Is it right for hundreds of people to watch the  torture of an animal? That is the question that Members have to ask themselves.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">7.45 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">One of the roles of the Minister is not only to protect and  conserve wildlife but to increase public appreciation of wildlife and to  educate the public on the importance of our native flora and fauna. How can he  do that and, at the same time, authorise the grotesque spectre of a sentient  creature being pursued by two greyhounds down a 100-yard course in front of a  large crowd? No one can square that with me. It is simply not creating an  appreciation of our wildlife and the nurture of it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I know exactly where I will be going as far as this debate  is concerned. I urge everyone not to vote on the basis of instructions from a  party Whip but to vote on the basis of their conscience. When Members go to bed  tonight, they will have to ask themselves whether they walked through the Lobby  with a clear conscience or whether they were terrorised into doing so by a Whip  who would make it absolutely clear that there would be no positions whatsoever  &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Dessie Ward.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Look at what happened to Dessie Ward when he stepped out of line. However, they  do not have to look to their own party for an example. They need only look at  what happened to poor Declan O&rsquo;Loan when he dared to step out of line. I have  heard of blood sports, but being brought before Margaret Ritchie is perhaps  more terrifying than being brought before the greyhounds. Declan O&rsquo;Loan was  stripped of his office and humiliated in public. And where is poor Declan now?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Does the Member accept that that has happened to some people and they have  survived and are still here today?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: Mr Molloy, you survived, but only just. You  were publicly humiliated because you dared to suggest that certain aspects of  RPA were OK. As it happened, that was done totally in vain, because the whole  thing was torpedoed anyhow. You took all that pain for no gain.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We have seen what happened to an errant Back-Bencher who  dared to step out of line with the SDLP, which is supposed to be the moderate  nationalist party. Therefore, what on earth would happen if a Back-Bencher was  to step out of line on hare coursing tonight? It would be very painful indeed &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  They would be forced to listen to one of your speeches.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  That would be too much of a torture.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">That leads me to ask another fundamental question: where is  the SDLP this evening? Where has the SDLP been throughout the entire debate?  Where is that sleeping giant? Perhaps giant is too much to say and I should say  party. We have sat here all day and listened to contributions from the DUP,  Sinn F&eacute;in, the Ulster Unionists, the Green Party and the Alliance Party.  However, the SDLP has been very noticeable by its absence. I accept that its  Members have made a few interjections, but where are the big guns, or what is  left of the big guns?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>: It occurs to me that they may be running  with the hare and hunting with the hounds.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  We are keeping the best till last, Jim.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  take it then that the Member for Mid Ulster will be contributing to this  important debate.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>: No, but he is going to vote on it.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: It strikes me as strange that a party that  purports to represent rural communities, particularly those west of the Bann,  has not said anything. I suspect that, as the Member for Newry and Armagh implied, the SDLP wants to have its cake and eat  it. Its Members want to sit in the Chamber and vote for things that they know  their community will accept, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>: My name is not Jim Wells. We will make our  position very clear later.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: Let me make it absolutely clear to the Member  that I am totally consistent. I am against snares and against hare coursing.  You will not catch me in the duplicity &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Where are you on ASSIs, Jim?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  am in favour of ASSIs and am against a bungalow blitz. I am absolutely  consistent in my environmental credentials in the party and the Assembly. I am  still pulling the knives out from my chest and my back as a result of that. I  assure you &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>: Are you anti-country sports?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Order. This is a debate, and all  Members should be included in it. This little interlude between two Members  should not go any further. Mr Wells, have you completed your speech?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Certainly not, Mr Deputy Speaker. Having a free vote in the Chamber is a  once-in-a-lifetime experience. On Saturday, I will have been a Member for 16  years, and in all that time, I have never had a free vote in the Chamber.  Therefore, I assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I am going to enjoy this  opportunity. It is a very long time since I have had an unlimited opportunity  to speak, so I am really going to go to town. As I said, we are going to be  here until midnight anyhow.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Let us move on to the issue of snaring. I am going to be  consistent and say that I still have grave reservations about the use of snares  for the capture of wild animals. I need to explain that, because some Members,  particularly Mr McKay, seem to be a bit confused about what we are talking  about.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There are several types of snares. There is the  self-locking snare, which is banned. That involves a wire going round the neck  of the animal, which tightens as the animal struggles. The animal then  suffocates or experiences horrific injury. Those snares were banned under the  Wildlife (Northern Ireland)  Order 1985, and they will be banned under the new legislation.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The second type is the free-running snare, which has a stop  on it. Technically, the snare should shut around the animal&rsquo;s neck but only  tightly enough to hold it. The gamekeeper should then find the animal and, if  it is a protected species or a domestic animal, remove it from the snare  relatively undamaged and let it go. If the animal is a fox or a mink, for  example, it is knocked on the head and killed.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">If that is what is going on in the countryside at present,  very few people could object. However, the League Against Cruel Sports provided  us with evidence, even for areas such as the Ards Peninsula and Fivemiletown &mdash;  I will not name the actual locations &mdash; of numerous examples of snares that do  not have stops on them, which means that they lock around an animal&rsquo;s neck, or  snares that clearly have not been checked for 24 months never mind 24 hours. I  have seen a picture of a fox&rsquo;s skeleton in a snare, so it was obviously never  checked.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There are also examples of snares being placed at a height  where an animal gets caught in it, falls back and is strangled. There are  examples of weights being attached to loose snares so that an animal gets a  snare around its neck and has to trail the weight around. That is the problem.  Despite all the assurances that various Members have given us about how wisely  snares are used, in reality, an awful lot of extremely nasty stuff is  happening.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I spend an awful lot of time walking in the hills because  of my interest in birds of prey, and I regularly come across animals that are  trapped in snares that have never been checked. I come across the rotting  corpses of animals such as badgers and sometimes even domestic pets, and it is  quite clear that nobody has bothered to check the snares for weeks or months.  As a result, the animal has either died through strangulation or its neck has  almost been cut in two. That is what happens to the lucky ones, but the others  are kept trapped with no water or food for day upon day and die of starvation  or exposure as a result. That is what is going on, and, unfortunately, it is  happening in respectable and well-managed estates and farms where very little  effort is made.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will listen to the Minister with interest. If he can  convince me that the proposals will lead to a radical change, that snares will  be regularly visited, that protected animals and domestic pets will be released  and that the animals caught in the snares and that are classed as vermin will  be quickly dispatched, that is a different issue. However, I still have great  difficulties with what is being suggested, because, far too often, I have come  across the suffering that snares cause. If, as a result of the registration and  the training and of what effectively seems to be a licensing system, we get a  major change in the attitude to snares, it will be great news for all  concerned.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned about people saying that there is no  alternative, because the Larsen trap, which has been mentioned, has been a  major conservation success story. Before the Larsen trap reached production,  there was what was called the pole trap. Metal jaws were placed on top of a  pole in the middle of a field, a bird of prey landed on it, its foot was caught  in the trap, and it dangled until it died. That is a very cruel way to die.  People said that there was no alternative. Then the Larsen trap was introduced.  I am sure that you have seen it in action. It is a cage where the bird sits on  top, the roof opens up, and the bird falls in and flies around. Someone then  comes along and inspects the trap. If the species is protected, such as a  buzzard or sparrowhawk, it is released; if it is a grey crow or a magpie, it is  dispatched.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">People said for years that that would never work. The  Larsen trap has had enormous benefits not only for gamekeeping, but for nature  conservation, because under the old system, a pole trap simply killed anything.  It was totally indiscriminate, and if a bird was found in one, it was so badly  damaged that nothing could be done, and it had to be killed. Hopefully, with  the reputable gamekeeping that is practised in Northern Ireland, if something  which is protected is found in a Larsen trap, the cage door is opened and it is  thrown out back into the wild.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">One reason, we believe, why the buzzard population throughout  the United Kingdom, and,  indeed, the Irish   Republic, has increased  dramatically has been the move towards the Larsen trap. With a bit of  ingenuity, therefore, and maybe a bit of funding from the Department,  alternatives can be found. If a realistic alternative is found, we should move  rapidly away from snaring, because snaring is so indiscriminate in what it  kills. An awful lot of badgers, in particular, die as a result of snaring.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will listen to the Minister&rsquo;s arguments and those of  other Members. However, at least I am consistent. How can anyone say that hare  coursing is not cruel and snaring is cruel? That is totally wrong. It strikes  me as wanting to have your cake and eat it. The difference is, of course, that  Sinn F&eacute;in and its supporters support hare coursing and do not support snaring.  It is as simple as that. They see on what side their bread is buttered in terms  of votes.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I appreciate what the Member says about traps as opposed  to snares. Will the Member take into account and give some appreciation to the  fact that a lot of the terrain where animals are being caught is particularly  rough and not suitable for vehicles, and it would just be impossible for a  gamekeeper physically to carry numerous traps around to set the numbers to meet  the scale of what would be required?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Whether or not that statement is correct, and whether or not it is viable to  carry around small traps, the Department should initiate pilot projects to find  alternatives. The Larsen trap is normally quite big, about 5ft by 4ft.  Therefore, it would be totally impracticable to use that. However, small traps  are already available &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of the Environment</strong>: I know that the Member  engages in hill walking, but when he goes on some of those hill walks how many  of those 5ft by 4ft cages would he like to carry up the hills on his back?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: The honourable Member misunderstood me. I am  saying that it would not be practicable to take a Larsen trap up into those  conditions. However, a smaller trap that would catch something the size of a  fox or a mink is much more portable. The Department should investigate the  other options. I am sure that, with a bit of thought and a pilot project to  experiment to find out what the other options are, we can find a system that  achieves what we all want. No one in the Assembly is saying that foxes should  not be killed &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am slightly concerned that the Minister&rsquo;s argument may be somewhat  disingenuous. If the purpose of snares or traps is to protect and manage land,  surely their use will be much more on lowlands or suitable farmland, rather  than on hills or rough vegetation, where the need for regulation will surely be  much less.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Certainly this is more viable in a lowland situation &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of the Environment</strong>: I am surprised at the  ignorance demonstrated, which is the unfortunate aspect of this debate. A lot  of ground nesting birds nest in the uplands. When I talked earlier about  Glenwhirry, I should have explained that it is north of Doagh in the Larne to  Ballymena direction. It is very high ground. That is where they used snares to  take out the 600 foxes. As a consequence, we have more snipe, curlew, lapwing  and hares.</p>
