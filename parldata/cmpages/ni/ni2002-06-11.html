            </font></b>
  <center>
  <font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received notice from the Minister of Finance and
  Personnel that he wishes to make a statement on the Senior Civil Service
  review.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel (Dr Farren): </b>With<b>
  your permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on behalf of the
  Executive about the independent review report ‘Appointment and Promotion
  Procedures for the Senior Civil Service of the Northern Ireland Civil Service’
  and the intention to open it up for public consultation.</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive agreed in late 2000 to commission an
  independent review. The review became a formal commitment in the Programme for
  Government that signified the importance which the Executive place on ensuring
  equality of opportunity for all. The review team, under the chairmanship of
  Lord Ouseley, was formally commissioned by the then Minister of Finance and
  Personnel, and the team commenced work in March 2001.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lord Ouseley is managing director of Different Realities
  Partnership Ltd and a former chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality.
  The team comprised: Rosheen Callender, national equality secretary of the
  Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union (SIPTU); Dr Trefor
  Campbell, managing director of Moy Park Ltd; Sir Bob Cooper, former
  chairperson of the Fair Employment Commission; Judith Eve, chairperson of the
  Civil Service Commissioners for Northern Ireland; Prof Gerry McKenna,
  vice-chancellor of the University of Ulster; and Dr Monica Wilson, chief
  executive of Disability Action.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The team operated under the terms of reference that had
  been agreed by the Northern Ireland Executive as follows: to review the
  effectiveness of current policies, practices and procedures concerning
  appointment to, and promotion within, the Senior Civil Service to ensure that
  they facilitate the business objectives of Ministers and Northern Ireland
  Departments by providing for the timely and efficient filling of posts with
  appropriate staff; to promote the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) goal
  of being fully representative of the community that it serves by tackling
  under-representation in the NICS as quickly and as effectively as possible; to
  address any identified obstacles to fair participation by all sectors of the
  community; to match best practice in other major public and private sector
  bodies in Northern Ireland and beyond; to examine the roles of officials and
  Ministers at each stage of the selection process; to consider the appropriate
  level of independent involvement, taking account of the statutory role of the
  Civil Service Commissioners for Northern Ireland, in recruitment and selection
  processes; and to make recommendations.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although retirement age is not referred to explicitly in
  the terms of reference for the review, the then Minister of Finance and
  Personnel, Mark Durkan, asked the review team to consider that matter and to
  take into account the possible implications for the entire NICS.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The independent review team submitted the report in March
  2002, and the Executive considered it in May. The report is wide-ranging, and
  I am grateful to the team for the work it has undertaken in presenting its
  findings and recommendations. The team has conducted a thorough analysis
  during which it consulted with key stakeholders, called for a range of
  presentations on NICS practices, sought statistical analysis and external
  validation of the analyses and called for equal opportunities information from
  New Zealand to provide a benchmark.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Executive Colleagues and I welcome the report, which
  contains 25 recommendations. They include two recommendations on retirement
  age; given that they have implications for the entire NICS, not only the
  Senior Civil Service, I have decoupled them from the report and will treat
  them as a separate issue. Two further recommendations are outside the
  legislative competence of the devolved Administration, and they will be raised
  directly with Whitehall Ministers. They are: recommendation 4, that the
  Secretary of State should seek to ensure that the Civil Service Commissioners
  for Northern Ireland are fully representative of Northern Ireland society; and
  recommendation 22, that the UK Government should be urged to introduce
  appropriate legislative change in relation to the nationality requirements
  that are imposed on those Civil Service jobs that are classed as public
  service posts. Therefore, 21 substantive recommendations must be considered.
  However, one recommendation is overarching as it refers to the need to develop
  an implementation action plan.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review lasted longer than had originally been expected.
  That was due to difficulties in aligning members’ diaries for meetings and
  also to the fact that the task was more complex than had been anticipated.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the review the team commented on the dynamic nature
  of the environment in which the NICS operates and the progress that had been
  made. Consequently, many of the specific recommendations deal with areas where
  work is already under way or where it is planned to meet legislative change or
  business need. The Executive agreed that officials should continue to
  progress, or initiate, action on the majority of the recommendations and that
  challenging targets for the achievement of those recommendations should be set
  out in the action plan, which will form an integral part of the further
  consultation process.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two recommendations that we believe need careful
  consideration through further consultation before any action is taken. The
  first is the recommendation that all Senior Civil Service vacancies be
  externally advertised. A range of equal opportunities and business
  considerations will be identified in the consultation paper, on which various
  stakeholders will wish to express their views.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recommendation on early action to reduce the long-hours
  culture of the Senior Civil Service needs to be considered in a similar way.
  The review team believes that culture to be a serious obstacle to
  participation across all the section 75 groups. There are a range of legal and
  business issues that will be considered in the consultative paper.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive, having considered the report, have decided
  to issue a consultation paper, which will include a detailed draft action plan
  on those recommendations on which action is under way and on which comments
  would be welcome, and request specific comments and views on the two
  recommendations I have highlighted — external advertising of all Senior
  Civil Service vacancies and long-hours culture.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At least 12 weeks will be devoted to public consultation,
  and the report will be published on the Internet. To allow for the holiday
  period, public consultation will start in July and will be completed by 31
  October. I have arranged for copies of the report to be placed in the Assembly
  Library today. Once public consultation is completed, any equality impact
  assessment required in respect of proposed policy changes will be taken
  forward, subject to normal screening.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive welcome the report and wish to make early
  progress on its implementation. They recognise that many of the issues raised
  by the review are complex and challenging. It is, therefore, important to hear
  what interested stakeholders have to say on the issues associated with the
  recommendations and action plan. Further consultation will enhance and
  maintain the progression towards equality of opportunity for all in respect of
  appointment and promotion procedures for the Senior Civil Service.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel
  (Mr Molloy):</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement on the review and
  thank the review team for the work that it has done.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In view of that fact that the review has taken longer than
  anticipated, can the Minister give any indication about the implementation of
  those aspects of the review that can be brought about immediately? Has he had
  any indication from Westminster regarding the timescale of the nationality
  question and how it could be resolved?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Member’s compliments to the review team,
  who worked exceedingly hard. As I said, that work will be recognised in the
  contents of the report. It has been a complex task.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said that it is our intention, with respect to many of
  the recommendations, to develop an implementation plan and to proceed with it
  as soon as possible. So the answer is essentially about the ongoing
  implementation of the recommendations that the plan will seek to address from
  now on. Indeed, as I said, some of the recommendations relate to actions that
  are already under way. However, I also said that we are not saying that, in
  the course of the consultation, we do not want to hear views regarding those
  recommendations that are already being acted on. We welcome views, comments
  and further recommendations regarding those particular aspects of the plan
  that might attract the attention of particular groups and individuals.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a willingness in Whitehall to address the
  nationality issue. It is a matter of finding parliamentary time to do so. To
  underline the urgency with which we want the matter addressed, after today’s
  statement I will be communicating with my Whitehall counterparts to ensure
  that action is taken to address the issue through the required legislative
  change as soon as possible.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
  </i><b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and
  Personnel (Mr Beggs):</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister accept that all Northern Ireland citizens
  are treated impartially with regard to opportunities within the Civil Service
  whether they carry a British passport or an Irish one? Given that there is no
  discrimination against local citizens on grounds of nationality, why should
  they face additional outside competition from other European countries for
  appointments to the Senior Civil Service?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How will the Minister ensure that the high reputation of
  the Civil Service is protected against the perceived poor practice that
  occasionally occurs in the Republic of Ireland and other European countries?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To answer the third question, there are adequate controls
  in place to ensure that the integrity of the Civil Service is maintained to
  the highest standards. Where any shortcomings are revealed with respect to
  those controls, steps will be taken immediately to address them. It is my
  experience that the highest standards do obtain, and I have no reason to
  question them. Members can rest assured that everything is done to ensure that
  those standards are maintained.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To answer the first question, arising from the spirit of
  the Good Friday Agreement, posts in the Northern Ireland Civil Service should
  be open to people of nationalities other then British. It is a curious anomaly
  that Ministers can come from the other part of this island and exercise
  ministerial authority with no inhibitions on their attaining their posts,
  notwithstanding their nationality. The same opportunity should be extended to
  those who seek posts at the highest level in the Civil Service. When, rather
  than if, candidates of other nationalities can apply, they will have to meet
  the same standards and criteria as all others who seek appointment at that
  level.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The statistics contained in the annexes to the review team’s
  report show a fairly dynamic pattern with regard to community affiliation and
  gender in the Senior Civil Service. The dynamic is in the right direction with
  respect to the balance between Roman Catholics and Protestants and between
  males and females. That is to be welcomed. If the Member’s question implied
  discrimination, I would point out that the review team in no way highlights
  discrimination in any form, and it comments favourably on the dynamic.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s statement is a clear indication of his,
  and the Executive’s, commitment to ensuring equality of opportunity by
  opening up the Senior Civil Service to everyone, regardless of religion,
  gender, physical well-being or ethnic origin.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that work is already under way in some
  areas covered by the recommendations. Given the proposed consultation
  exercise, is that not premature? How does he propose to deal with the
  recommendations on the age of retirement, which he has decoupled from the
  report?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the Member’s first question, many of the
  review team’s recommendations relate to building on the equality of
  opportunity work taken forward to date by the Northern Ireland Civil Service.
  Given that that principle is central to devolution — indeed, it is enshrined
  in section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 — all of us want to promote
  the concept of a Civil Service that is seen by all whom it serves to be open
  and inclusive and which is staffed by those who can best meet the business
  challenges of providing support to the devolved Administration. That will be
  facilitated by early action on many of the report’s recommendations. It will
  enable the Northern Ireland Civil Service to build on the work to date in
  developing what almost all observers regard as robust and equitable processes
  and procedures.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft action plan and timetable will be drawn up to
  show progress and plans for implementation, and that will form part of the
  consultation process. Consultees will be provided with a clear indication of
  the direction proposed to implement the majority of the recommendations made
  by the review team. As I have already underlined, in adopting that approach
  consultees will have the opportunity to confirm that the proposals are
  acceptable, or, if otherwise, that there are other issues to consider in
  relation to the action plan.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect to the recommendations on the age of
  retirement, I indicated that I decoupled them simply because they affect the
  Civil Service as a whole. Proposals on the age of retirement for the Northern
  Ireland Civil Service are currently being formulated and will be brought
  forward separately to the Executive in the autumn, given that the implications
  are Civil Service-wide and not exclusive to the Senior Civil Service. The
  review team’s two relevant recommendations will, therefore, be considered in
  bringing those proposals forward. I stress that the trade unions will be fully
  engaged in all discussions on the matter.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must be put on record that the elusive report has not
  been made available to Members — copies are neither in the Assembly Library
  nor in the Business Office. It is therefore difficult to discuss it.
  Nevertheless, I have some questions.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister referred to the dynamic swinging in the right
  direction. Between 1985 and 1999, the Civil Service has swung from 58·6%
  Protestant representation to 53·4%, and Catholic representation has increased
  from 41·4% to 46·6%. Those figures suggest that Protestants are
  under-represented in the Civil Service. How does the Minister expect that to
  impact on the Senior Civil Service? If Protestant representation in the junior
  ranks of the Civil Service is too low, it will impact on the Senior Civil
  Service in later years.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister tell the House why there was only 42·3%
  Protestant representation in the former Department of Higher and Further
  Education, Training and Employment when he was the Minister and why there is
  only 45·9% Protestant representation in the Department for Social
  Development; 40·3% in the Social Security Agency (SSA); and 49·4% in the
  Child Support Agency (CSA)?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is most inappropriate for a Minister to have so little
  confidence in his own civil servants that he believes that he must go out of
  the country to recruit people with the necessary quality and integrity to run
  Northern Ireland.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure the Member that the appointment of civil servants
  does not rest in my hands. The Executive must ensure that equality of
  opportunity is available to all.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The nationality issue is pertinent and must be addressed.
  The record shows that many people from Northern Ireland have availed of the
  opportunity to rise to senior posts in the Civil Service in the South of
  Ireland. I see no reason why we should not open up posts in our Civil Service
  to people from other jurisdictions, and we should not be afraid to do so. That
  is a matter of equality and, as the review team recommended, it is being
  addressed. It is important to remember that my statement was about a report
  that a review team has submitted to the Executive. We welcome many of its
  recommendations and have found that they are in line with our thinking.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots referred to the composition of the statistics. It
  is important that we note the dynamic in the Senior Civil Service and that we
  welcome a Senior Civil Service that broadly reflects the balance in our
  community. Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 requires us to consider
  not only religious affiliation and gender, which are the most significant
  categories and foremost in people’s minds when they address the composition
  of labour forces, but also other categories. We are obliged to consider
  disability, sexual orientation, race and other important categories.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review team examined not only the dynamic of the Senior
  Civil Service but the composition of lower Civil Service grades. There is an
  imbalance — incipient, in some respects — in lower Senior Civil Service
  grades, particularly with respect to Protestant males. There would be concern
  if that imbalance were to gather momentum. As a member of a political party
  that was founded in the context of the civil rights movement and was informed
  by civil rights issues, I would be concerned if there were a dynamic in
  reverse to that that has emerged recently. Therefore, we shall address the
  matter as part of the equality agenda of the entire Civil Service.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the report, but I am disappointed that it has
  taken so long to present it to the Assembly. The report was not in the Library
  this morning, and Members have little opportunity to discuss a document that
  they have not seen. When will the report be available?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill asked about retirement age, a point that I
  mentioned to the Minister on several occasions. I cannot understand why the
  matter was not included in the terms of reference initially, but I am grateful
  to Mr Durkan for ensuring its inclusion later.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned that the two recommendations have been
  decoupled from the report. Will that not delay the resolution of this
  important matter until a decision is made? In the meantime, people will be
  forced out of the Civil Service against their will. I hope that Civil Service
  employees who are approaching the age of 60 will be encouraged to stay at work
  rather than be hounded out.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall place a copy of the report in the Library today. I
  trust that Members will study it and express their views, individually or at
  party level. I do not intend to inhibit debate on the issues. During the
  forthcoming 12-week consultation period, Members will be able to deliberate on
  the report and the associated consultation document, which will be published
  by the beginning of July.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards decoupling, I hasten to assure Mr McCarthy that
  the issue of the age of retirement is not intended to create further delay.
  That matter applies to the entire Civil Service; however, the review is about
  the Senior Civil Service in particular.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClelland] in the Chair)</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The retirement age issue applies to the entire Civil
  Service, and it is appropriate that the matter should be decoupled. It is not
  appropriate to suggest that my predecessor belatedly added the issue to the
  terms of reference — it was there from the outset. The retirement age issue
  must be considered in that context; it did not suddenly arise when the review
  was established. There has been lively debate on the matter. It was important
  to bear the issue in mind, as the review could have, and has, shed some light
  on it. The matter must be addressed urgently, and I have given a commitment
  that the Executive will consider the proposals in the early autumn. I hope to
  be able to come to the Assembly then with proposals on how the issue should be
  addressed in the future.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP strongly endorses the report’s recommendation
  that the nationality criterion be dropped. There should be no bar on anyone
  from entering the Senior Civil Service. The issue has been live for some time,
  and I urge the Minister to continue to press it with the United Kingdom
  Government. The Minister said that there is willingness in Whitehall to
  consider that viewpoint. How does he intend to raise the matter with the
  Westminster Government?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The need for change in the nationality legislation has been
  brought to the attention of the UK Government. They have indicated their
  keenness to open up civil employment under the Crown. I have commissioned
  definitive legal advice on the question of nationality from the departmental
  solicitors’ office. It is my intention to write to the Secretary of State
  without delay to advise him of the recommendation made by the independent
  review team and to seek his commitment to a change to the nationality
  legislation being introduced by the UK Government as a matter of priority.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that the Executive appear to be
  indulging in foot-dragging over the report’s implementation? The report was
  commissioned in 2000; the review team submitted its report in March 2002; and
  it seems to have lain around for a couple of months, as the Executive only
  considered it in May. It is the middle of June, and the report has only now
  come to the House.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 1.12 of the report states that</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Consultation also played an important role. The team
  consulted with a range of stakeholders, including Ministers, Trade Unions, The
  Equality Commission, umbrella groups representing the Section 75 categories,
  the DFP Committee, Permanent Secretaries&quot;.</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could go on. Many people have been consulted, and we are
  now told that there is to be further consultation and that implementation will
  not take place until goodness knows when. Will it even happen this year? I
  detect foot-dragging. Would it not be better for the Minister to implement the
  report straight away?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I get tired listening to the same hollow complaint from Mr
  Close. How much consideration has the Committee given to the review team’s
  work? I understand that the Committee — of which Mr Close is a member —
  met Lord Ouseley once, but he was unable to have a second meeting with it.
  What does that say about that Committee’s consideration of the issues? Mr
  Close had the opportunity to pursue the matter vigorously. I do not take
  kindly to being chided by Mr Close, given the — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not take kindly to that, given the record of the
  Committee, of which Mr Close is a member, on addressing the issue. It may not
  have been his fault, but we must consider the way in which the Committee has
  deliberated on the issue before criticising the review team. The review team
  was asked to carry out some work. There were some difficulties about the
  timetabling of meetings. The team thought that the matter required greater
  deliberation than was at first deemed necessary; hence, the length of time
  that it took to complete the review. When the review team reported, the
  Executive deliberated on the matter as expeditiously as possible.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An implementation plan is being prepared on many of the
  recommendations. Three recommendations in particular are being highlighted for
  further consultation. The recommendations on retirement age, the nationality
  issue and the composition of the Civil Service Commissioners for Northern
  Ireland are being treated separately for reasons that I have already outlined.
  Progress will not be delayed.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close raised the issue of wide consultation. Yesterday,
  he attacked the suggestion that there should be general consultation on issues
  that concern the working of the Executive and the Administration. His approach
  to consultation is exclusive and elitist. He believes that only certain
  sections of society should receive consultation documents and be invited to
  submit their views.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday, I rejected the suggestion that we should be
  anything but fully transparent in the consultation process. I shall remain
  committed to such an approach as long as I have any responsibility for
  consultation, especially consultation on such fundamental issues as equality
  of opportunity. I make no apology for holding a full public consultation, and
  I reject the suggestion that we should be elitist, selective or include only
  certain groups, as Mr Close advises us to do.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Doherty:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister made it clear that it is appropriate that the
  Senior Civil Service be open to all nationalities. Therefore, will he join me
  in wishing the members of the Republic of Ireland senior soccer service, many
  of whom perform at the highest level in the English League, all the best in
  their match today?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our Senior Civil Service performs to the highest standards,

  trust that the House will join me in extending good wishes to the Irish team,
  which I understand will take to the pitch in Japan in just over one hour. I
  trust that there will be some rejoicing over lunch.</p>

            </font></b>
  <center>
  <font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To enable Members to speak to the Bill, I shall take the
  vote on clause 1 separately, by leave of the Assembly. I also intend to group
  the remaining clauses for the questions on stand part, followed by the two
  schedules and the long title.</p>
  <b><i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 1 (Safety of railways)</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M Robinson:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairman of the Committee for Regional Development has
  asked me to extend his apologies for not being able to attend today’s
  debate. He has asked me to speak on behalf of the Regional Development
  Committee. I begin by expressing the Committee’s thanks to those who gave
  evidence to the Committee. I also express the Committee’s gratitude to the
  departmental officials who made themselves readily available, often at short
  notice, throughout the Committee’s deliberations.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members will be aware, the Railway Safety Bill is
  primarily technical in nature. It is, none the less, an important piece of
  legislation that has major safety implications for our railway network. The
  importance of the legislation cannot be underestimated, particularly when we
  look at the recent rail accident at Downhill and, indeed, other accidents such
  as the unfortunate death of a contract worker on the railway track at Sydenham
  in February of this year. Such accidents serve only to reinforce the need for
  exacting standards of rail safety.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker, during the Committee’s deliberations
  on the Railway Safety Bill, it noted that the Bill will enable several
  important pieces of secondary legislation to be brought forward. In
  particular, clause 1 of the Bill provides for existing legislation to be used
  to introduce railway safety regulations. Under article 17 of the Health and
  Safety at Work (Northern Ireland) Order 1978, the Department will have the
  power to require rail operators to prepare safety cases. That is to be
  welcomed. A safety case approach will require Northern Ireland Railways (NIR)
  to conduct a rigorous audit of all its plant infrastructure and machinery,
  including its trains. The Minister is to be praised for ensuring that the
  safety cases will be closely scrutinised. His Department has reached an
  agreement with the Health and Safety Executive whereby the railway
  inspectorate will act as agents to scrutinise and approve each risk assessment
  and safety case. That will undoubtedly contribute to ensuring that safety
  cases are carefully prepared and closely monitored.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the basis of the legislation is the requirement for
  railway operators to provide safety cases, it is important that the safety
  case regulations are swiftly implemented, particularly in the light of recent
  accidents. I note that during the Second Stage debate the Minister stated that
  the safety case regulations will require NIR, in particular, to undertake
  quite a bit of work before it has prepared a detailed safety case.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, I ask the Minister to monitor the situation
  closely to ensure that NIR completes the work as soon as possible. The
  Committee for Regional Development had no amendments to the Railway Safety
  Bill and agreed unanimously with all its clauses and schedules.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McNamee:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I do not
  oppose the Bill, but I wish to make some comments on it. I welcome the
  principle of introducing railway safety legislation, given that the existing
  legislation is Victorian-based and does not attend to today’s health and
  safety standards.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Concerns were raised about the Bill, notably by Translink
  and by Transport 2000. One of the initial concerns was that an opportunity had
  been missed to introduce substantial legislation. The Bill is enabling
  legislation; it does not contain detail. Detail will be provided by secondary
  legislation in the form of Statutory Rules.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall make a general comment on the use of Statutory
  Rules as a means to introduce legislation. Statutory Rules will be used to
  introduce the detail required to ensure that rail safety is addressed properly
  by legislation. However, Statutory Rules are not subject to the same level of
  scrutiny by Committees or the Assembly as Bills that are introduced through
  the Assembly’s legislative process. I question whether that is the correct
  way for the Assembly to deal with legislation — to pass enabling legislation
  and then have the detail to be provided by Statutory Rules. I shall comment
  briefly on the Bill itself.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McNamee, I remind you that we are considering clause 1
  rather than the entire Bill.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McNamee:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 1 sets out the substance — or lack of substance
  — of the Bill. It sets out the Bill’s overall position. That is what I am
  speaking to, as opposed to the detail.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Please continue.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McNamee:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not speaking to any of the other clauses or their
  content. I am speaking on the general nature of the Bill, which is covered by
  clause 1.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill generally reflects the system in GB. Some concerns
  were raised about the application of the safety case system were there to be
  fragmentation of the rail network. I refer to paragraph 5 of the explanatory
  and financial memorandum, which states:</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Furthermore effective rail safety legislation would
  have to be in place before a Public Private Partnership, which would involve
  the private sector operating trains in Northern Ireland could be introduced.
  We could not risk the profit motive tempting the private sector to cut corners
  on safety measures.&quot;</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The explanatory notes refer to an issue regarding
  public-private partnerships. Concern was raised that if there is a
  fragmentation of the operation of the railway, and there are contractors who
  have sub-contractors, and sub-contractors who have subsequent sub-contractors,
  a difficulty would arise in identifying who was responsibe for safety issues.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also clear that the Bill does not identify how safety
  auditing would be carried out on the safety cases and who would be responsible
  for ensuring that operators actually carry out the risk assessments, as
  provided for in their safety case. The Bill also fails to identify who would
  monitor whether operators are taking remedial action to deal with any problems
  identified by the risk assessment.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are my main concerns. When the detail of the Bill is
  introduced in the form of Statutory Rules, the Assembly will have an
  opportunity to study it.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the Bill. Has good practice in the safety of
  railways throughout the world been looked at? Japan springs to mind, and the
  speed of the trains there. Football teams are using the bullet train to get
  from their bases to the grounds. Will the Minister join with me in supporting
  England in the match tomorrow against Nigeria? I hope that the team wins and
  reaches the last 16.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>

  about a budget.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not take points of order at this stage, Mr Hutchinson,

  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You may raise a point if you wish, Mr Hutchinson, but you
  will not disturb the business of the House once more. I call Mr Peter
  Robinson.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You should behave even-handedly.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will you repeat that, Mr Hutchinson?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You should behave even-handedly.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Regional Development (Mr P Robinson):</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Mark Robinson for his kind comments and the
  Committee for its support for the Bill. It was analysed seven times and given
  clause-by-clause consideration, so it has been looked at thoroughly.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my statement to the House yesterday on the accident at
  Downhill on 4 June, I showed how important the Bill is to enhancing railway
  safety here. Last month’s crash at Potter’s Bar, which followed another
  major accident on the mainland, and the recent fatality on the Bangor line
  show the need for a focused legislative and operational approach to modern,
  safe travel by railway.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were fortunate that the outcome of the Downhill
  derailment was not more serious. The Assembly will agree that we shall not
  have a culture of complacency on safety matters on our railways. I thank
  Northern Ireland Railways for its positive contribution to the development of
  the Bill and the secondary legislation that will follow. I urge it to complete
  its safety case. Although there have been criticisms about the control of
  railway safety in Great Britain, none has been directed at the safety case
  concept. Rather, criticisms have been directed at the fragmented nature of the
  railway industry there.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Mark Robinson asked about the secondary legislation that
  will flow from the Bill, and that was also raised by another Member. I assure
  Members that I have no plans to change the integrated way in which the rail
  industry is operated here. I am convinced that the best way to ensure safety
  on our railways is by introducing a safety case regime along the GB model.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The safety case Regulations will follow as soon as possible
  after the Bill becomes law, allowing NIR the necessary time to finalise its
  safety case and have it thoroughly examined. I also thank Mr Mark Robinson for
  his comments on the measures that my Department has taken to ensure that all
  safety cases developed here are rigorously examined.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall deal with the issue of the Bill’s being enabling
  legislation. That is one of its inherent strengths. Those who have had
  ministerial responsibility may have been — at least, they will be by now —
  frustrated by the length of the legislative process and how long it takes for
  a Bill to come before the House. I shall outline the number of Statutory
  Regulations that flow from the Bill, and I assure Members that the Committee
  for Regional Development will thoroughly examine all the secondary
  legislation.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the Railways (Safety Case) Regulations, my
  Department will introduce other Regulations that will flow immediately from
  the Bill and will constitute further steps to assist NIR to provide a safe
  railway.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Railways (Safety Critical Work) Regulations will seek
  to ensure that staff engaged in safety critical work, such as drivers and
  signalmen, are competent and fit and do not work for periods that are likely
  to result in fatigue. The Railway Safety Regulations will provide for train
  protection and warning systems to be fitted to all trains, and at key
  junctions and other danger points on the network.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of the Railways (Approval of Works, Plant and
  Equipment) Regulations, new and altered works, plant and equipment, including
  locomotives and rolling stock, will be subject to approval by the Department.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Railways Safety (Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations
  will replace many old provisions that date back to 1842, covering the
  prevention of unauthorised access, for example, by fencing, the means of
  passenger communication on trains, the prevention of collisions and
  derailments through adequate signalling and braking systems and the prevention
  of accidents to staff, such as injury to trackside workers caused by moving
  trains.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Private Crossings (Signs and Barriers) Regulations deal
  with the erection of signs and barriers at private crossings and are aimed at
  further improving the safety of the public at railway crossings.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendments will be made to RIDDOR — the Reporting of
  Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations — to make them
  applicable to railways. Guidance on that matter will be prepared and
  published.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Detailed Regulations are being introduced. If we were to
  take them through by primary legislation, which would require two or three
  years in each case, many accidents could occur during the period of delay.
  This is a much speedier way to proceed.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said at the Bill’s Second Stage, I intend to consult
  the Committee for Regional Development on each set of Regulations. I shall
  also consult with other interested parties. The consultation process will
  commence in early summer.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Committee and the House for their consideration
  of this important Bill. I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will join me in
  wishing the England football team every success. We hope that they travel
  safely to the game. I look forward to the Bill completing its Assembly Stages
  by the summer recess and to the introduction of the secondary legislation by
  the early autumn.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following motion stood in the Order Paper:</p>
  </font></i><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Standing Order 18(5) line 7 delete &quot;Standing Order
  10(3)&quot; and insert &quot;Standing Order 10(5)&quot;. — <i>[The
  Chairperson of the Committee on Procedures (Mr C Murphy).]</p>
  </i></font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The two motions form part of the Committee’s ongoing work
  on ensuring that the Assembly’s Standing Orders and procedures best meet its
  needs.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not an attempt by the Committee on Procedures to
  extend by the back door the sitting time on a Monday. Instead, it is intended
  to clarify existing Standing Orders and to introduce an addition to Standing
  Orders that will improve the way the Assembly conducts it business. There are
  two main changes to Standing Order 10. The first and substantive change
  relates to paragraphs 6 and 7 of Standing Order 10, which require business to
  be interrupted at 6.00 pm so that the Speaker can put the Question of whether
  business should continue. Members will know that it has become the convention
  that that requirement has not been enforced.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That requirement has been in Standing Orders since
  devolution, and it was taken from the Standing Orders at Westminster. Members
  will recognise that, at the time of devolution, we had little experience of
  how business could best be managed, and it was recognised at that time that it
  would be a case of amending Standing Orders as time progressed and experience
  highlighted their deficiencies or otherwise. Paragraphs 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 are
  examples of Standing Orders that were considered to be necessary at that time,
  but in practice they have become redundant.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In consultation with the Business Committee and the Speaker
  about amending Standing Orders, it became clear that the opportunity should be
  taken to include a facility to allow scheduled business, if it has been
  delayed, to proceed beyond 6.00 pm. The proposal is to allow business to
  continue beyond 6.00 pm only on a Monday, and it applies only to scheduled
  business. That means that the Business Committee must plan business for a
  Monday on the basis of a 6.00 pm finish.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Business Committee decides that pressure of business
  is such that it will go on beyond 6.00 pm, a suspension of Standing Orders
  will continue to be required. This amendment to Standing Orders is designed to
  cater for those circumstances in which, for different reasons, business on the
  Order Paper has not been completed — for example, when business is
  unexpectedly delayed.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That may arise when there are a number of divisions, which
  on average take more than 15 minutes each, or when a Minister decides to make
  a statement. That is fine on a Tuesday because there is no pressure on time,
  as business can run on into Tuesday evening. However, on a Monday that is more
  difficult because business cannot proceed beyond 6.00 pm. Therefore, if a
  Minister wants to make a statement on a Monday when business is already
  anticipated to run until 6.00 pm then, because up to an hour can be allocated
  for questions in addition to the time that it takes to make the statement,
  some business may fall. Invariably, the business that is likely to fall is the
  final item on the Order Paper, which is normally the Adjournment debate.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee on Procedures considers that that would be
  unfair to the Member who brought the Adjournment debate or to any other motion
  that fell in that way. Therefore, the Committee, with the support of the
  Business Committee and the Speaker, considers it reasonable that in such
  circumstances, where there is insufficient time before 6.00 pm to complete the
  remaining business, the Speaker should have the discretion to allow business
  to continue until 7.00 pm or until the outstanding business is completed —
  whichever is the earlier.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee on Procedures also considers that the
  facility to allow business to go on until 7.00 pm is necessary because, in the
  near future, it proposes to amend Standing Orders to allow a Member to table,
  with the agreement of the Business Committee, an urgent motion for debate. The
  scenario envisaged is that, on a Monday morning, a Member might propose to
  table a motion for plenary debate on a matter of urgent public importance. The
  proposed amendment to Standing Orders would help to facilitate that by
  allowing business to proceed until 7.00 pm. If that facility had been
  available, it would have been used only once since the start of this session.
  Therefore, it is to be used only occasionally, when unforeseen business delays
  the scheduled business.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second change proposed to Standing Orders is to clarify
  Standing Order 10(2). The proposed rewording is necessary to clarify the
  authority of the Business Committee to arrange an earlier start to Monday
  sittings. At present, Standing Order 10(2) sets out the days and times for
  which sittings of the Assembly should ordinarily be arranged and provides for
  the allocation of time for business within those sittings to be determined by
  the Business Committee. Clarity is required in order to define
  &quot;ordinarily&quot;. The Business Committee has interpreted the word
  &quot;ordinarily&quot; to allow the plenary to start earlier than 12 noon on a
  Monday when the pressure of business forces it, although that has occurred
  only once during this session. That was endorsed by the Speaker in a ruling he
  made on 5 November 2001.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members were confused about why it was necessary to suspend
  Standing Orders to proceed beyond 6.00 pm, yet it was unnecessary to suspend
  them to start before 12 noon. I shall not go into the detail of the reasons
  behind that, but there is currently no flexibility in Standing Order 10 to go
  beyond 6.00 pm on a Monday, unlike on a Tuesday when Standing Order 10(3)
  allows business to proceed beyond 6.00 pm and, if necessary, into Wednesday.
  Hence the suspension of Standing Order 10(2) is required.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that Standing Orders are clear and that
  Members are in no doubt as to their meaning, and as such the Committee
  proposes the rewording of Standing Order 10(2), which clarifies the authority
  of the Business Committee to arrange an earlier start to a plenary sitting on
  a Monday.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has taken the opportunity of the
  consideration of Standing Order 10 to make several drafting changes to it. The
  first of those is in Standing Order 10(1), where a new category of business
  — Assembly Business — has been inserted. Items of business in that
  category would include petitions, Speaker’s rulings, et cetera.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Changes to Standing Order 10(2)(b) are proposed in order to
  reflect current practice. We have made it clear that at the end of each
  sitting up to one hour &quot;may&quot; be set aside for an Adjournment debate
  as opposed to &quot;shall&quot;, in order to reflect the way in which business
  is managed.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I re-emphasise that changes to Standing
  Order 10 should not be viewed as an attempt to change the set finishing time
  of 6.00 pm on a Monday — 6.00 pm will continue to be the standard finishing
  time for the Business Committee when it plans business for a Monday. If the
  pressure of planned business is such that the sitting is required to go beyond
  6.00 pm, a suspension of Standing Orders will continue to be required.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second motion on the Order Paper is a consequential
  change to Standing Order 18. The change is proposed to reflect the new
  numbering in Standing Order 10.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the motions to the Assembly.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have several
  remarks to make on the motions. However, at this point I am able to speak only
  to the first motion.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can speak to the first two motions.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank the Chairperson of
  the Committee on Procedures for outsmarting me by going out of his way to
  allay the fears that he probably expected me to raise, especially the
  potential to extend the hard-fought-for family-friendly hours, of which the
  Assembly, as a modern legislature, can rightly be proud. The Assembly agreed
  that there should be family-friendly hours, at least on a Monday.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that the Chairperson has assured us that an
  extension beyond 6.00 pm will be used only occasionally, when there is a delay
  or some unscheduled business. The Women’s Coalition has always accepted
  that, under exceptional circumstances, time could, and should, be allowed
  after 6.00 pm. However, the most important issue is the hard-fought-for
  principle that the Assembly’s family-friendly hours should not be broken or
  disturbed in any way. Having listened to the Chairperson’s opening remarks,
  I believe that that is still the case.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present, we start at 12 noon on a Monday, so rather than
  an extension beyond 6.00 pm, why can we not start business earlier? When we
  first sat, and when I was involved in the setting of the Standing Orders in
  the original Committee, the agreement was a 10.30 am start on Mondays.
  Travelling distances, party meetings, et cetera on a Monday morning suggested
  that that time should slip. Again, we are prepared to accept that. However,
  why slip to 12 noon? Why not have 11.00 am as the starting time, so that that
  extra hour between 6.00 pm and 7.00 pm could be made up in the morning? The
  family-friendly hours of the Assembly would, therefore, be preserved. The
  principle here is that Members have families that they should, could and would
  like to — whether they are men or women — go home to in the evenings in
  order to see their children before they go to bed. I am glad that the
  Chairperson of the Committee on Procedures has said that there is the
  potential for starting business earlier on a Monday morning and that only on
  rare occasions will the principle of the 6.00 pm finishing time be breached.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.45 am</p>
  </i><b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Murphy:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has made the position clear, and I give the
  credit for outsmarting Ms Morrice to the Committee Clerks rather than to me,
  as they prepare the wording on these occasions.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Family-friendly hours are important. They are not only an
  issue for the Women’s Coalition. They are an issue for all Members. I have a
  young family. I am sure that many other Members in the Chamber also have young
  families and are, therefore, keen to continue with family-friendly hours.
  However, 6.00 pm might mean family-friendly hours for someone living in north
  Down or in south Belfast. For Mr Gerry McHugh, Mr Tommy Gallagher, Mr Derek
  Hussey or Mr Pat Doherty, for example, a 6.00 pm finish does not necessarily
  mean particularly family-friendly hours. By the time those people get home it
  is closer to 9.00 pm. Family-friendly hours benefit those who live fairly near
  to the Assembly, but they are not so much of a benefit to those who live far
  away.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has always been supportive of the principle
  of family-friendly hours. It is clear in the proposal that the ability to
  extend the time beyond 6.00 pm should be used in exceptional circumstances
  only, when the scheduled business has been delayed or interrupted and it is
  necessary to continue until it is finished or until 7.00 pm, whichever is the
  earlier. Certainly, that is the intention of the proposal.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Previously, the plenary did start at 10.30 am on Monday
  mornings. However, parties were under pressure because they had no time during
  the week to carry out internal party business, given that Committee meetings
  are held on Wednesdays and Thursdays and, indeed, on Fridays, when the
  Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development meets. It is difficult for
  larger parties to meet at a time when there is no other pressing Assembly
  business. A trial period was introduced in which the plenary began on Mondays
  at 12 noon. At the end of the trial period, the Committee on Procedures
  proposed to make the 12 noon start permanent, with the exception that the
  Business Committee can decide — as it did on only one occasion — that the
  plenary should start earlier. At that time, no party objected to business
  starting at 12 noon. It appears, therefore, that those arrangements are
  satisfactory, and the Committee on Procedures is still satisfied with them.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, Standing Orders are open to change, and any
  Member can propose an amendment if he wishes. Standing Orders are constantly
  under review. Based on experience, the Committee is satisfied that the changes
  that it has proposed today will allow for the conduct of business on Mondays.
  The Committee is also content that the changes will facilitate the extension
  of business and that there is no need to start the plenary before 12 noon,
  other than in exceptional circumstances when the Business Committee so
  decides.</p>

  </font></b><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move:</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Standing Order 54(1) after paragraph (l) insert:</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;(m) Those functions relating to the Planning Appeals
  Commission and the Water Appeals Commission transferred to the Office of the
  First Minister and Deputy First Minister by The Departments (Transfer of
  Functions) Order (Northern Ireland) 2001.&quot;</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I say at the outset that the motion to amend Standing
  Orders has been moved at the request of the Committee of the Centre, which has
  asked for an extension to be made to its remit to allow it to examine certain
  functions relating to the Planning Appeals Commission and to the Water Appeals
  Commission.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is because under the Departments (Transfer of
  Functions) Order (Northern Ireland) 2001, administrative responsibilities for
  the Planning Appeals Commission and the Water Appeals Commission transferred
  from the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, the Department for Regional
  Development, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and the
  Department of the Environment to the Office of the First Minister and the
  Deputy First Minister.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The responsibilities transferred were administrative in
  nature, centring on the appointment of commissioners, the determination of
  their remuneration and allowances, the appointment of persons to assist the
  commissions in the performance of their functions and to determine their
  remuneration and allowances and the remuneration and allowances for any
  assessor appointed by the chief commissioner to assist at hearings, the making
  of rules for regulating proceedings before the commission and the prescription
  of fees in respect of appeal applications.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall not explain the rationale for the transfer, as it
  is not within the remit of the Committee on Procedures. It has already been
  the subject of consideration by the relevant Statutory Committees. However,
  the Committee understands that the thrust behind the Order was to reinforce
  the independence of the Planning Appeals Commission and the Water Appeals
  Commission. The Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister has
  recently initiated a quinquennial review of the Planning Appeals Commission
  and the Water Appeals Commission.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee of the Centre wishes to be involved in that
  review. To do so, an amendment to Standing Orders is required, because
  Standing Order 54, which sets out the remit of the Committee of the Centre, is
  very specific. Unlike Statutory Committees, whose remit is to advise and
  assist their respective Ministers in the formulation of policy, the remit of
  the Committee of the Centre is limited, as it can scrutinise only those
  functions specified in Standing Orders or any other matter determined by the
  Assembly.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The net effect is that each time the Committee of the
  Centre wishes to scrutinise a new role of the Office of the First Minister and
  the Deputy First Minister, an addition to the list of functions in Standing
  Order 54 is required; hence this motion to amend Standing Order 54. The
  proposed wording of the amendment reflects the legal advice that the Committee
  received to describe the transferred functions.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson has again responded to my query to a
  certain extent. However, I would appreciate further information, as the
  Planning Appeals Commission and the Water Appeals Commission are to be the
  Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister’s responsibility.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson said that he should not necessarily comment
  on that. He said that it was to do with reinforcing the independence of those
  bodies, which we certainly welcome. Will the Chairperson elaborate on the
  exact reason for the transfer? If not, will he tell us where we can find it?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Murphy:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reason for the transfer was not a matter that the
  Committee on Procedures considered; it was a matter for the Statutory
  Committees that were involved in the transfer and for the relevant Ministers
  and Departments. The Departments (Transfer of Functions) Order (Northern
  Ireland) 2001 came into force last year. I am sure that the reasoning behind
  that legislation is laid out in the explanatory notes. The Statutory
  Committees and the Committee of the Centre have considered the matter. The
  Committee on Procedures’s function was simply to table a motion to amend
  Standing Orders to allow the Committee of the Centre, whose remit is firmly
  fixed in Standing Orders, to consider matters relating either to the Water
  Appeals Commission or to the Planning Appeals Commission.</p>

  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(1) A substantially verbatim report of the proceedings at
  all sittings of the Assembly and Committee meetings that form part of the
  legislative process or at which evidence that will contribute to a report by a
  Committee is being taken shall be prepared and published. The report shall be
  known as the Official Report (Hansard) and shall be a record of the
  proceedings in the language spoken.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(2) A revised edition of the Official Report (Hansard) for
  all Assembly sittings and Committee meetings which form part of the
  legislative process shall be prepared in bound volume form at such times as
  the Speaker shall determine. Such bound volumes shall also contain written
  questions and answers for the period covered.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(3) Editorial control of the Official Report (Hansard)
  shall rest ultimately with the Speaker but shall be exercised on his behalf by
  the Editor of Debates.&quot;</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Official Report, or Hansard as it is usually called, is
  the report of proceedings in plenary. It is a substantially verbatim report,
  and it performs a vital function in showing the Assembly’s commitment to
  openness, accountability and accessibility. In addition, Hansard offers a
  unique record for posterity that will help future generations paint a picture
  of how we lived today and how and why we made decisions.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Standing Orders do not contain official provision for the
  production and publication of the Official Report. That is at odds with the
  practice in the Scottish Parliament, the Dáil and the Welsh Assembly. It
  could leave the Assembly open to the accusation that it is not being seen to
  give Hansard the standing that it merits. More importantly, it could also be
  argued that the omission is contrary to the intention of schedule 6 to the
  Northern Ireland Act 1998, which states that</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The standing orders shall include provision for
  reporting the proceedings of the Assembly and for publishing the
  reports.&quot;</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Standing Order 70 makes provision for the printing of the
  minutes of proceedings, which are the official record of proceedings. Those
  form the record of decisions made and should not be confused with Hansard,
  which has a separate, independent role. Moreover, Standing Order 70 is
  concerned with the Office of the Clerk and with the records of the Assembly.
  Hansard is a separate entity, with editorial control resting with the Editor,
  who exercises that responsibility on behalf of the Speaker. It is important
  that that independence is reflected in a separate Standing Order, rather than
  by being incorporated it into an existing Standing Order, such as Standing
  Order 70.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the issue has caused no problems to date, the new
  Standing Order makes formal provision for Hansard and removes any uncertainty
  as to its role. It gives Hansard the important place that it merits in the
  operation of the Assembly. I commend the motion to the Assembly.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Fee:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to talk specifically about the role of the Editor of
  Debates and the role of the Speaker and about paragraph (3) of the proposed
  new Standing Order 75, which states that</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Editorial control of the Official Report (Hansard)
  shall rest ultimately with the Speaker but shall be exercised on his behalf by
  the Editor of Debates.&quot;</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand from what the Chairperson of the Committee on
  Procedures has said that we are following the precedent set by Westminster,
  the Scottish Parliament, the Dáil and the like. On enquiry this morning,
  however, I have not been able to find any Standing Order of this nature that
  pertains or applies in Westminster, the Scottish Parliament, the Dáil or in
  any other Western democracy. There are certainly conventions, custom and
  practice, and proper procedures that have been built up over centuries, but
  they do not vest editorial control of the Official Report in the Speaker of
  any of those Parliaments.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To be fair to the Editor of Debates in this House and to
  the Speaker, both of whom have provided exemplary performances in recent
  times, we should not confuse the authority vested in those two positions. From
  the outset, all of us agree that Hansard has to be a true and accurate account
  of what happens here. It is a crucially important historical record. Following
  recent judgements in the High Court in England, it is also a very important
  legal record from which courts may draw inference. However, to rest the
  editorial control with the Speaker, who may have to adjudicate on a challenge
  to the official record, is to confuse his role with that of the Editor of
  Debates.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is the role of the Editor of Debates to try to ensure
  that a true and accurate account of the sittings of this Assembly is recorded
  and published at an appropriate time. All of us in this place know that the
  Hansard staff have been wonderful in meeting the deadlines that we have set
  for them, both before and after devolution. The former Editor of Debates did a
  wonderful job when he was here, and his successor has followed in his
  footsteps.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, to divest the Editor of Debates of the
  responsibility for editorial control will cause the House substantial
  problems.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.00</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An old journalistic maxim is that the editor of a newspaper
  will publish such prejudices of the owner as the prejudices of the advertisers
  will allow. If we allow this new Standing Order, it will open the House to
  that accusation. If we consider again the procedures and precedences in other
  places, we will find that the independence of the Speaker guarantees a full
  and accurate Official Report and that the independence of the Editor maintains
  the Speaker’s role and the accuracy and veracity of the Official Report.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Committee on Procedures to reconsider the new
  Standing Order and to implement procedures whereby the Assembly Commission,
  the Clerk and the Speaker’s Office are compelled to ensure that the Official
  Report (Hansard) is properly published. I beg the Committee not to remove the
  editorial independence of the Editor of Debates.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member for Newry and Armagh, Mr Fee, voiced my concerns
  eloquently.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Murphy:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Member for Newry and Armagh will try to answer Mr
  Hutchinson’s concerns eloquently also.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All new Standing Orders or changes to Standing Orders
  brought to the Assembly by the Committee on Procedures are checked by the
  Assembly’s legal adviser, and the Speaker is consulted. The Speaker’s view
  has been sought on this Standing Order. I assure Mr Fee and Mr Hutchinson that
  the Committee would be happy to consider all queries about Standing Orders. If
  a Member is not content with the Committee’s view, he or she is free to
  table an amendment.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Standing Order confirms current practice. In
  Westminster, editorial control rests with the Speaker, and that arrangement
  has not caused the problems that John Fee anticipates occurring here. In
  Westminster, the Speaker is responsible for the Official Report (Hansard) and
  delegates editorial responsibility to the Editor of Debates. The Speaker, as
  required by Erskine May and, perhaps, Westminster Standing Orders, appoints
  the Westminster Editor of Debates.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee on Procedures checks amendments to Standing
  Orders and proposed Standing Orders with the Assembly’s legal adviser. If
  Members think that that arrangement raises a problem, the Committee would be
  happy to re-examine it. The proposed Standing Order is, however, legally
  competent and reflects current practice here and in other legislatures.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly approves the Report of the Committee for
  Culture, Arts and Leisure on its Inquiry into Cultural Tourism and the Arts
  and calls on the Executive to ensure that the Committee’s recommendations
  are evaluated and implemented at the earliest opportunity.</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure launched this
  important and substantive inquiry on 25 January 2001. Its terms of reference
  were: to determine the status of the existing relationship between the
  cultural and tourist sectors; to identify areas of the arts with the potential
  to be incorporated into a cultural tourist product that could be actively
  promoted by the tourist industry; to identify the support required by cultural
  activities, including languages, to enable that heritage to be maintained and
  enhanced; and to report to the Assembly, making recommendations to the
  Department and/or others on action to strengthen the link between culture and
  tourism. The Committee also agreed that the inquiry should take particular
  account of the diversity and unique nature of the cultural tourism product
  that Northern Ireland can offer its visitors.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not exaggerating when I say that the Committee was
  astounded to receive 82 written submissions from a wide variety of groups and
  individuals with an interest in every conceivable aspect of culture, heritage
  and the arts.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These ranged from the North of Ireland Bands’ Association
  to the Ulster Historical Foundation; from the Hilden Brewery Company to the
  Lyric Theatre; from the University of Ulster to the Somme Association; and
  from the National Trust to Gael-Linn. We held 39 oral evidence sessions with
  key organisations representing the main sectoral interests. In addition, the
  Committee had the opportunity to draw on the experience gained during
  fact-finding visits to Boston, Paris and Barcelona, which were taken in
  association with the inquiry. We were fortunate to be able to engage with key
  public and private sector organisations in those cities.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the outset, the Committee accepted that Northern Ireland’s
  negative image, combined with the failure to promote and market the region
  enthusiastically, resulted in lost years of tourist growth compared to other
  parts of the United Kingdom and Ireland. We certainly cannot promise good
  weather and warm seas in Northern Ireland, but today’s traveller is
  increasingly seeking more than sun-and-sand destinations. People are living
  longer, remain more affluent in their retirement, and have a growing interest
  in visiting places where they can learn about different cultures.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most people come to Northern Ireland to visit friends and
  relatives, and although this important market has sustained the industry in
  hard times, we now have a tremendous opportunity to develop new markets. The
  growth of a top-quality cultural tourism sector, which will have the potential
  to attract the general tourist and the high added-value niche market, forms
  the core of that opportunity. Noting that tourism’s contribution to Northern
  Ireland’s gross domestic product (GDP) is less than a third of that in the
  Republic of Ireland, Scotland and Wales is a stark illustration of how far we
  have to go to catch up. In fact, it is 1·8 % compared to 6% in the other
  regions. Also, we cannot rely, at least in the short term, on the North
  American market as a visitor source. If Northern Ireland’s culture and
  heritage are to remain key attractions, it is essential that targeting
  customers outside the long-haul market is given priority. The Republic of
  Ireland, Great Britain and continental Europe must be regarded as critically
  important.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, the Committee believes the scope for cultural
  tourism to be immense. Key niche products such as roots tourism and local
  studies, education and linguistics, literary and other arts-based summer
  schools, festivals, theatre, music and dance, as well as the many facets of
  our built and natural heritage, all hold considerable potential for growing a
  vibrant cultural tourism product. Northern Ireland has a wealth of cultural
  and heritage attractions that are key elements of the experience that we can
  offer to the visitor. Over 440 official heritage sites have been identified in
  recent research by the Academy for Irish Cultural Heritage at the University
  of Ulster. There are also many unofficial sites.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Culture and arts enrich our lives, build confidence and
  inspire hope in communities. They must not be seen as elitist pastimes. The
  Committee also believes that Northern Ireland’s approach to the arts and
  culture as products must embrace the principles of sustainability; long-term
  viability; limited negative impact; local involvement; and positive social and
  economic benefits for all communities, groups and individuals involved.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our inquiry also brought home to us the importance of
  industrial heritage tourism and its potential, largely untapped in Northern
  Ireland. That can help to create employment and investment in industrial areas
  where manufacturing industry has declined. It can also restore pride in
  communities and improve people’s perceptions of their localities. Many local
  authorities, particularly in industrial towns in the English Midlands, are
  incorporating industrial heritage tourism into their tourist development
  programmes.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By comparison, in Northern Ireland, we have largely
  neglected our industrial heritage and allowed many of its best examples to be
  destroyed. We now need to commit ourselves to recognising the importance of
  preserving and reusing it for sound economic reasons, as well as for the
  education and appreciation of our community and visitors.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Linked to industrial tourism is the story of the Titanic.
  Several written submissions expressed interest in the development of a
  maritime museum in the Belfast shipyard. The story of the Titanic has been
  told across the world, but Northern Ireland has failed to capitalise on the
  fact that the ship was designed, built and launched in Belfast.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The plans for the Titanic are currently held in the Ulster
  Folk and Transport Museum at Cultra. The original drafting rooms, Thompson
  Dock and the keel blocks on which the Titanic rested during its fitting-out
  still exist. Furthermore, the SS Nomadic, the last remaining White Star Line
  tender, which was used to ferry passengers to and from the Titanic, is
  currently located on the River Seine in Paris. The acquisition of that vessel
  could be a focal point for a Titanic attraction.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also evident that we have not developed the arts
  festival and summer school sector to the same extent as the Republic. While we
  have a few major festivals that have proven sustainable over the years, there
  is enormous scope for further developments. We must also consider how to fill
  the gaps that exist during the summer months with arts- and culture-based
  activities and attractions for the community and tourists.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must do more to persuade the promoters of world- class
  and major international events that Northern Ireland is a good location.
  However, we must be in a position to back that up with hard cash.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland lags significantly behind England and
  Scotland as a location for world-class and major international events. It is
  even further behind the Republic of Ireland. The region’s negative image is
  clearly a major factor for performers, promoters and sponsors.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Events Company’s budget for this
  year is just over £1 million. Two years ago, the Government of the Republic
  allocated an extra £2·5 million a year for three years to bring in extra
  events. That was in addition to the financial support already provided for
  four major golf tournaments and a range of other cultural, arts and sports
  events. For example, approximately £7 million has been allocated to the 2005
  Ryder Cup from the public purse, and the return to the Irish Exchequer on this
  investment alone is expected to be between £50 million and £100 million.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That illustrates clearly the need for that kind of
  investment. We must persuade promoters that Northern Ireland has good
  facilities and is a safe, sensible location. We also need to persuade
  ourselves that we can host major events.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales have
  allocated significant budgets to attract big events. With competition becoming
  more intense, the key to success is to enable the Northern Ireland Events
  Company to give a financial commitment sufficiently far ahead in the bidding
  process.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the year that we have submitted our bid for European
  Capital of Culture 2008, it is astonishing that Belfast is the only major city
  in the United Kingdom without a dedicated public art gallery. The Ulster
  Museum has a unique collection of Irish art and a collection of British
  contemporary art that was described by ‘The Times’ as the finest outside
  London. Irish art is hugely popular, particularly in America, but the museum
  cannot display its full collection because it does not have enough space. The
  development of a museum of creative arts could be, and should be, the key
  priority for the Department, and the Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland
  (MAGNI). That would provide a showcase for the prestigious collection held by
  the Ulster Museum and enable exhibitions of world-class collections to be
  staged.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is worth noting that the Monet, Renoir and the
  Impressionist Landscape exhibit, which was on show in the new Millennium Wing
  of the National Gallery of Ireland between January and April this year,
  attracted an average of 2,000 paying visitors each day, a large proportion of
  whom would have had a considerable economic impact on the city with overnight
  or weekend stays.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With 60 million people claiming to have Irish ancestry,
  there is a worldwide market for roots tourism. However, investment in, and the
  marketing of, genealogy have been largely neglected. We heard compelling
  evidence about the impact that a move away from the use of townland names
  would have on communities and potential roots tourism.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other issues considered included: the promotion of our
  linguistic diversity as a unique asset to the tourism industry; promoting and
  showcasing our tradition of quality band music through hosting international
  competitions; the cultivation of traditional song and music; providing support
  for local professional opera; developing dance; reviewing the opportunities
  which exist to support the independent professional theatre sector; the
  potential to develop and co-ordinate cultural trails and tours; and the
  importance of film and television in forging positive images.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee’s report sets out 56 recommendations, and
  their implementation will be essential to improving the quality, cohesiveness
  and competitiveness of our cultural tourism.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only two weeks ago Committee Colleagues and I attended a
  conference on cultural tourism in County Cork. The theme of the conference was
  ‘A National Asset Awaiting Sensitive Development’. Delegates heard that
  tourism is undoubtedly Ireland’s greatest area of growth, with
  ever-increasing numbers of tourists interested in culture and tradition. Those
  tourists are prepared to go out of their way to remote places to find
  authentic, living culture, much of which is hidden among the hills and valleys
  and has lived on for generations without disturbance. That is every bit as
  true in areas such as the Glens of Antrim, the Sperrins or Rathlin Island as
  it is in Cork, Kerry or Clare.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our hidden locations need to be developed alongside the
  better known cultural centres to ensure a wider spread of attractions and,
  consequently, more tourist spending throughout rural and urban areas. The
  challenge will be to ensure that authentic culture survives commercialism.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the speakers at the conference expressed the view
  that the extent to which a country’s culture is known elsewhere is a
  defining characteristic of any people. That is a thought-providing statement.
  He encapsulated the importance of culture for us all by saying that</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;If you were to meet a man coming along the road who
  couldn’t tell you where he was coming from, it would be a fair bet that he
  wouldn’t be able to say where he was going either&quot;.</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all have a stake in the enhancement and development of
  Northern Ireland’s cultural tourism product, and we must take an interest in
  it.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to express a number of acknowledgements on behalf of
  the Committee. We were encouraged by the level of involvement in the inquiry.
  We thank all those who sent in written submissions and those whose appearance
  before the Committee to give oral evidence provided us with much vital food
  for thought.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to record the Committee’s appreciation of the
  assistance given by Boston College and the British Council in facilitating our
  invaluable study visits to Boston, Paris and Barcelona. As Chairperson of the
  Committee, I pay tribute to my Committee Colleagues, who overcame many traumas
  to get to where we are and worked exceedingly hard to bring the report to
  publication. I pay an equally glowing tribute to the Committee staff, the
  Committee Clerk and its specialist adviser.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cultural tourism is a broad area, and like the Committee’s
  report on inland fisheries, our recommendations involve several Ministers and
  their Departments. It is a prime example of an area in which joined-up
  government is essential and can deliver real benefits for the entire
  community. My Committee Colleagues will further develop the issues emerging
  from the report, and I look forward to an interesting debate. I commend the
  report to the Assembly.</p>

  </i><b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Culture, Arts
  and Leisure (Mrs Nelis):</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the
  motion and thank all those who contributed to the report through oral and
  written submissions. I commend the Committee Chairperson and the members who
  diligently, and at times passionately, went through the various drafts. They
  all fought for the cultural and artistic attractions of their constituencies.
  I am especially grateful to the Committee Clerks, for without their skill we
  may not have had a report at all. However, the person engaged as special
  adviser to draft the report failed to address adequately the four stated
  objectives in a precise or objective manner.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cultural tourism and the arts, as the Committee learnt, can
  be anything from the search for local place names such as Lisnamucky, to
  listening to the tales — tall or otherwise — of the yarn spinners, or
  engaging with the flautist skills of the local flute band.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some years ago, a group of Pennsylvanian millionaires came
  here in search of the Elliot and the Curran clans. They knew the place names
  from whence their ancestors had come and they managed to find the &quot;auld
  sod&quot;, as some people describe it. We did not capitalise on the interests
  of those wealthy cultural tourists, and the report suggests many
  recommendations on how we may attract and service such visitors in the future.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The submissions to the inquiry were exciting, varied and
  informative. They came from groups as diverse as the National Trust, the Glass
  Ceiling Theatreworks, the Gortin and District Historical Society and the
  Hilden Brewing Company, which unfortunately did not provide a sample of its
  wares with its submission. Despite the wealth of evidence from such diverse
  cultural, artistic and tourism organisations, the special adviser to the
  Committee used his own material throughout the report as a source of
  information and to verify that information. It was disappointing to note that
  that happened despite excellent submissions.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the special adviser’s evidence was generated via
  the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. It was apparent from the first draft that
  the special adviser and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board did not understand
  the intricacies of the definitions and working of &quot;culture&quot; and
  &quot; the arts&quot;. That is best exemplified by the table used by the
  special adviser, which was sourced from the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. It
  failed to distinguish between visitors and tourists, and that type of
  statistic was used intermittently throughout the report without due care and
  concern for relevance.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The now infamous table excluded the sixteenth century Derry
  city walls and wiped the city’s historic landmark off the cultural and
  tourism top 20 map at a time when Derry City Council had bid to have the walls
  declared a world heritage site. The other famous Derry tourist attraction,
  Free Derry wall, did not get a mention from the special adviser either —
  such was the limitation and myopia of the expert appointed to draft the report
  for the Committee.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the places listed in the table, for instance the
  Pickie Family Fun Park — the second favourite tourist attraction — are
  unknown to people outside the Belfast and Bangor areas. I cannot imagine
  cultural tourists from Europe or the United States of America coming to visit
  a pool surrounded by rocks with the added attraction of a train and a donkey.
  I can imagine that the Pickie Family Fun Park would provide a great day’s
  outing for families from that area of the east coast. That shows the need to
  distinguish between the cultural tourists and visitors who come to see friends
  and relatives and who make up 40% of all the people who come to visit the
  North.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How do we turn the visitors of family and friends into
  cultural tourists? That is the major question.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recommendations, if adopted, show how heritage days,
  theme tours and trails can become special interest markets that offer specific
  experiences. More detailed research and analysis of the material submitted was
  needed in early drafts to help the Committee understand and interpret the
  widely diverse definitions of cultural tourism and the arts. The Committee is
  indebted to its Clerk, who produced a better, workable and relevant definition
  of our stated objectives.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
  Organisation (UNESCO) defines culture as:</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and
  emotional features that characterize a society or social group.&quot;</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Art is the outworking of those features, and culture is the
  glue that bonds us together. It impacts on every aspect of our lives. It
  allows us to celebrate ourselves and show the rest of the world who we are and
  how we live.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tourist is the person who comes to experience our
  uniqueness through the lens we offer. Why tourists come, and how to analyse
  that, is a major part of our recommendations and requires partnership between
  the major players. The jury is still out on why so many tourists come to this
  small island, but we can be sure that it is not for sun, sea and sand.
  Submissions from various groups and organisations helped us to examine that
  issue.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tourists may come in search of their roots and their
  identity; to seek out the place that produces Irish music, art, or literature;
  to see monuments of ancient civilisations; to see the artistic splendour of
  the Book of Kells, the Cathach, and the Broighter Gold; and to see the
  historic sites of the Boyne, Derry city walls, Newgrange and where the Titanic
  was built.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is accepted that many tourists come to look at our wall
  murals, and most tour operators now include those as part of their itinerary.
  Those attractions should be considered as specific elements of a cultural
  strategy proposed in section 5 of the report, but such a strategy should be
  based on an all-Ireland partnership between the arts, tourists and cultural
  organisations. Planned, resourced and managed tourist projects, whether they
  be festivals, events, band concerts or genealogical summer schools, must be
  co-ordinated in order to reflect the relationship among the visitor, the
  tourist and the local community.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The appearance of a close-knit community shaped around its
  culture and art creates a positive image. However, the essence of any cultural
  tourism and arts strategy must be rooted firmly in the cultural pluralism of
  the local communities. That would acknowledge that, although we share this
  island, we have distinctive codes of behaviour and historical identities.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report establishes that difference can be a key
  feature. Many of the success stories recorded in the submissions received
  little or no recognition or financial support from the agencies that have been
  set up to promote general tourism.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We recommend that all cultural tourism strategies should
  start with an inventory of resources. The process should include an assessment
  of how local people feel, as well as the views of the vested interest groups,
  such as local authorities, statutory agencies and others. Too often, tourism
  planning strategies are based on a hope and false expectations as opposed to a
  reliable and technically sound evaluation of potential impacts.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New and innovative partnerships and techniques must be
  considered — involving trusts, co-operatives and community councils — when
  implementing a cultural tourism and arts strategy. Our report will be the
  catalyst for such initiatives. I urge the Minister and the Department to
  support the motion. Go raibh míle maith agat.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Adamson:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I extend my thanks to the Committee for Culture, Arts and
  Leisure, chaired by Mr ONeill. I also thank the Committee Clerk and her staff
  for the hard work that they have put into this important report, which, I
  believe, shows the Belfast Agreement at its best.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The greatest of all historians, Gaius Cornelius Tacitus,
  wrote of the exhortation of the British nobleman, Calgacus, who fought the
  Roman Empire, when he said of the Romans:</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;There are no more nations beyond us; nothing is there
  but waves and rocks — the Romans more deadly still than these, for in them
  is an arrogance which no submission or good behaviour can escape…They create
  desolation and they call it peace.&quot;</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As recent events in Belfast have shown, many ordinary
  people in Northern Ireland have rarely felt so despondent and uncertain of
  their future. Whether real or imaginary, the perception in the Unionist
  community in particular, is that the so-called &quot;other side&quot; has
  gained most from the political process. That has been feeding an increasingly
  sceptical and negative appraisal of the Belfast Agreement, and what we call
  &quot;peace&quot;.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The overriding concern most frequently voiced by community
  activists is that there is in increasing internal disarray and even
  disintegration in Loyalist areas. The unemployment situation has rarely been
  so dire. The level of education attainment remains abysmal. The former
  community infrastructure, even if largely of an informal nature, has taken a
  severe battering from mismanaged redevelopment, the break-up of old
  communities and the absence of any long-term strategy for revitalisation and
  renewal. That is why such reports are so vital to social, economic and
  cultural regeneration in large areas of Northern Ireland.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department should assess the further potential for the
  development of dynamic cultural quarters in Northern Ireland’s cities to
  promote and showcase local culture and locations in which art and culture can
  be offered to all. District councils should place greater focus on the
  historic cores of our cities and towns, through the development of history
  trails, imaginative interpretation and storytelling in which we excel.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department and the Arts Council should assess the
  position elsewhere, regarding the requirements placed on developers to include
  public art into major schemes, particularly in urban areas. The Northern
  Ireland Tourist Board should determine, in each product group network, the
  extent to which themed tours and trails can be used for the special interest
  market as well as for the future tourists that we so desire.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In east Belfast, for example, there is ample potential to
  develop and co-ordinate trails and tours that focus on diverse aspects of
  culture and tradition. C S Lewis — perhaps the greatest Christian writer of
  the twentieth century — was born in Belfast in 1898. The C S Lewis tourist
  trail links the main places in Belfast and north Down that are most closely
  associated with Lewis, such as St Mark’s Church, Dundela; Little Lea,
  Circular Road; Bernagh, now known as Red Hall on the Circular Road; the Old
  Inn at Crawfordsburn; the Holywood hills, which were the template and origin
  for the Narnia tales — the greatest children’s stories ever written;
  Campbell College; Dundela flats and the centenary sculpture at Holywood
  Arches.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Little Lea and Bernagh, which is owned by the South and
  East Belfast Health and Social Services Trust, are still under threat of
  development. That must be reversed. At Bernagh, Lewis wrote his first book as
  a Christian — the great ‘Pilgrim’s Regress’ — an imitation of ‘The
  Pilgrim’s Progress’. That building must be protected from developers at
  all costs. The Chairperson also spoke in detail about the Titanic Trail,
  which, of course, has great potential throughout the world.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The historic cores of our key cities offer a great
  opportunity for tourism, as has been shown by the promotion of Derry’s walls
  and the O’Doherty Fort in Londonderry. Also, the development of heirskip, or
  heritage, villages, perhaps centred on the reconstruction of Belfast at the
  time of the American Revolution, could be created in inner east Belfast to
  facilitate the promotion of the Ulster-Scots language and culture. That should
  be done on an equal basis with Ulster and Irish Gaelic language and culture,
  to revitalise the entire area.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must require developers to incorporate public art into
  their major schemes, especially in urban areas, so that they can put something
  back into the community that they have pillaged for far too long. There is
  not, to the Committee’s knowledge, an officer at either central Government
  or local government level anywhere in Northern Ireland whose specific
  responsibility is to encourage the sponsorship and incorporation of artwork in
  public areas for all the public to see. We who pay the pipers should also call
  the tune.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hilditch:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a member of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure,
  I am pleased that the ‘Inquiry into Cultural Tourism and the Arts’ report
  has now been concluded and brought before the House. The inquiry was launched
  last January, and I, for one, never imagined that the Committee would be
  subjected to such an enthusiastic response. We received more than 80
  submissions. To add further support, the Committee also heard oral evidence
  from 100 people representing 39 organisations.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The workload was immense, so I join with other Committee
  members in thanking the Committee Clerk and the support staff for all their
  work on the inquiry in the past 18 months. I also thank those who took the
  time and trouble to make submissions, both written and oral, giving the
  Committee much food for thought on wide and varied issues within the terms of
  reference.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was clear from the outset that Northern Ireland was
  starting on the back row of the grid. Our geographical location on the
  periphery of Europe and the unreliable climate do us no favours. Those
  factors, combined with decades of terrorism and civil unrest, ensured that
  Northern Ireland could not reach its full potential. Regrettably, some figures
  indicate that, up to 2000, 62% of people who came to Northern Ireland were
  either visiting friends or relatives or were here on business. That left only
  18% who could be considered tourists.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the inquiry, the bottom fell out of the North
  American market in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in the United States
  on 11 September, leaving another void in an area that had witnessed a fair
  degree of growth. That, on top of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, has
  taken a severe toll.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only other negative issue on which I wish to comment
  was the repeated criticism of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, which
  featured time and time again in oral evidence. It has been a bad time recently
  for the Tourist Board, so I shall not dwell on the subject. However, there was
  consensus that there had been a failure to promote and market the region and
  to encourage tourist development of culture and the arts. However, some
  comfort can be taken from the work of the Cultural Tourism Partnership in
  placing culture at the heart of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board’s
  corporate plan.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report contains 56 recommendations that reflect issues
  from the arts of music, film, drama and dance to visitor attractions, cultural
  strategies, infrastructure, funding and much more. The recommendations show
  the depth of the key issues.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw the House’s attention to the recommendations that
  highlight the potential for festivals, summer schools and other events,
  especially recommendation 8 on the development of the festival sector. It has
  been established that festivals can play an important role at local level,
  specific to the culture of that area, and also on a wider regional basis. More
  importantly, they are major economic generators. For example, the highly
  successful Edinburgh Festival 2001, to which the report refers, redeemed an
  otherwise devastated Scottish tourism industry in the wake of the last year’s
  foot-and-mouth disease outbreak.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recommendation states:</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;District councils should consider how they could
  encourage the development of sustainable local community festivals, which
  would also provide a focus for visitors.&quot;</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That would complement existing major festivals. However, to
  develop their potential</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;they must be able to offer long-term viability and
  serve both the host community and the visitor.&quot;</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One local example is the Carrickfergus Waterfront Festival,
  held during the past two weeks, which included a re-enactment of the landing
  of King William in 1690. Every year, local people take pride in proclaiming
  their history and heritage, and visitors display their hunger to learn of the
  culture of others and eagerly return to witness the event.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">District councils have begun to realise the potential of
  such festivals, but promotion and co-ordination are essential. It was
  disappointing that several of the 26 district councils did not reply to the
  Committee’s request for information on local festivals. Those included four
  of the eight councils whose areas encompass the Causeway Coast and the Glens
  of Antrim, two of the country’s leading tourist attractions.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During our research, it was interesting to learn that a
  similar policy has been developed in France, where, until recently, 500
  festivals were not considered to be tourist products. Those are now
  specifically marketed, and 15% to 20% of visitors to major festivals are now
  foreign tourists.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recommendation 9, the Committee strongly encourages
  Belfast Festival at Queen’s to examine the potential of summer events and to
  use the broadcasting media to develop an international audience.
  Representatives of Belfast Festival at Queen’s stated in their evidence that
  they were conscious of the gap that exists during the summer. The festival is
  in its fortieth year, has proved its sustainability and has capitalised on the
  focus of Halloween. The Committee would support any proposal to organise
  events to fill the summer gap and to promote the festival more widely.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although Belfast Festival at Queen’s cannot rival the
  Edinburgh Festival, there is scope to tap into international coverage through
  the commissioning of a purpose-made showcase to highlight events during the
  festival to satellite television audiences worldwide.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I endorse recommendation 13, which calls on the Arts
  Council of Northern Ireland to liaise with district councils, the professional
  theatre and others to develop a summer arts programme for local audiences and
  visitors. Such a programme could serve a dual purpose as a training ground for
  young actors and as a frequently changing entertainment option.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Events Company only scratches the
  surface in its provision. I commend its efforts, but given our limited
  resources, we can only glance sideways in jealousy at our neighbouring
  devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales, where significant budgets
  attract major events. We must persuade potential promoters, as well as
  ourselves, that business can be done in Northern Ireland. However, given the
  Northern Ireland Events Company’s limited budget of £1 million, the key to
  success will be the positioning of a financial commitment sufficiently far
  ahead in the bidding process.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, confidence in the Northern Ireland Events
  Company was recently undermined by a Sinn Féin/IRA Member. That organisation
  destroyed stability with its campaign of murder and destruction but now has
  the audacity to portray itself as the minder of the public purse.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the Minister could consider another major event. In
  recent days, it has emerged that the local government auditor has written to
  Carrickfergus Borough Council, which in 1997 won the right to host the
  Optimist World Championship in sailing. Despite the fact that that successful
  event was a good economic generator for the area, the local government auditor
  has questioned the council’s entitlement even to bid to stage it. That
  bureaucracy is a worry, given our attempts to expand and bring world-class
  events to Northern Ireland.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. I commend the report and hope that
  its recommendations will be implemented soon.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support fully the contents of the report on the inquiry
  into cultural tourism and the arts. As a member of the Committee for Culture,
  Arts and Leisure, I am delighted that the report has come to the House.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee worked extremely hard. It listened to many
  groups and considered many written submissions. I hope that its Assembly
  Colleagues will support the report’s recommendations and that the Executive
  will act on it, because that can only benefit everyone in Northern Ireland.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must make up for the lost and wasted years. Northern
  Ireland has much to offer. I have repeatedly told the Committee’s hosts in
  Boston, Paris, Barcelona, Scotland and Galway that they should visit the
  Strangford constituency. It has it all — it is the best in the land. Of
  course, my Assembly Colleagues supported me fully at all times.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has two important features with which to
  attract visitors: genealogy, which could be classed as a &quot;roots
  strategy&quot;; and townland names. Recommendations 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23
  cover fully what must be done. The Northern Ireland Tourist Board and other
  bodies could play a significant part in a roots strategy. The report states
  that there are</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;60 million people worldwide claiming to have Irish
  ancestry&quot;.</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those people must be persuaded to visit us. Although they
  may discover that their relatives live in Cork, Kerry or Waterford, we should,
  through investment, development and marketing, entice them to Northern
  Ireland. We can assure them of a welcome and offer them attractions equal to
  those in other places. Ireland is a small island, and we can benefit if the
  determination is there.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recently received information about the Irish
  Genealogical Congress, which holds a week-long international conference every
  three to four years that attracts people from all over the world. Plans are
  afoot to hold the next conference in 2004. Belfast was considered as a venue
  in the past but, because of its problems, other cities were selected instead.
  Therefore, at this early stage, I appeal to the Minister of Culture, Arts and
  Leisure to consider seriously the provision of a real incentive that would
  bring the Irish Genealogical Congress to Belfast. It is an excellent
  opportunity that should not be missed.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I pay tribute to the work of our local historical
  societies, especially the Federation for Ulster Local Studies, which made a
  presentation to the Committee. The Assembly must support all that work.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee Chairperson mentioned my pet subject, which I
  have spoken about many times in the Assembly, and I shall continue to stress
  the importance of maintaining the precious heritage of Northern Ireland’s
  townland names. The previous time that I tabled a motion on townland names I
  mentioned Ballycranmore, Ballycranbeg, Ballyesborough and Ballyboghilbo.
  Townland names continue to be an attraction for visitors to Northern Ireland;
  therefore, they must not be forgotten.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In mirroring recommendation 21, I appeal to all
  Departments, district councils and other public bodies to include townland
  names on all correspondence. It is not good enough for Ministers to rely on
  the community to include townland names on correspondence. Since the early
  1970s, townland names have largely been omitted, so an entire generation may
  be ignorant of them.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.30 pm</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to applaud the staff of the Ordnance Survey
  of Northern Ireland, based at Colby House, Stranmillis Road, on their progress
  with the common address file. I understand that it is now called the compass
  address file. I hope that that will give us a complete list of all the
  townland names in Northern Ireland, that it will be completed in the autumn
  and that Departments will have no excuse not to include townland names on all
  their correspondence.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should also like to pay tribute to the Chairperson,
  Deputy Chairperson and members of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure
  for concluding this important inquiry into cultural tourism. I should also
  like to express my admiration and thanks to all the Committee staff for their
  help, courtesy and invaluable advice during the course of our work.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the presence of the Minister of Culture, Arts
  and Leisure, Mr McGimpsey, in the Chamber. I know he supports our work, and I
  hope that he can lead his Department and the other Departments to see that our
  recommendations are fully adopted.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Agnew:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to congratulate the Committee staff on the
  way in which they brought the report together. The Committee Clerk —
  affectionately known as &quot;Mrs Woman&quot; incidentally — and her staff
  have been tremendous in ensuring that the report is before us. We should also
  congratulate the Chairperson on his leadership throughout the inquiry.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was an interesting exercise, and we had submissions from
  more than 80 groups and individuals concerned about tourism. We asked all
  those people questions, and one thing that struck me about their views on the
  Tourist Board was that no one had a good word to say about it. Some did not
  comment at all. Although that is not my view, others suspect that rather than
  promoting a good image of Northern Ireland, the Tourist Board has promoted a
  bad image of itself — a significant comment. Again, and I may be speaking
  for myself here, we should analyse the usefulness of the Tourist Board and ask
  whether it is necessary. Around the Province local authorities provide most of
  the 450 plus tourist facilities.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am interested in the industrial heritage aspect, an area
  that is largely untapped here, unlike other parts of the free world. I was in
  Phoenix, Arizona, a few weeks ago, and there was a Titanic exhibition in
  downtown Phoenix. That evening I spoke to a group of approximately 35 business
  people and asked how many realised that the Titanic was built in Belfast. Only
  two people raised their hands. The rest did not know that the Titanic was
  built in Belfast, yet there they were having a Titanic exhibition in the
  middle of Phoenix. On display were all the artefacts that were found at the
  bottom of the ocean and brought ashore and that now make up a travelling
  exhibition.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Belfast should be proud of that. Some people seem to think
  that Belfast should be ashamed because the ship sank. We know why it sank, and
  it had nothing to do with the skills of the workers in Harland &amp;Wolff; it
  sank because the silly captain decided to try to break a transatlantic record
  and sailed straight into an ice field.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland should capitalise on its great industrial
  base of linen, agriculture, pottery, crystal, even whiskey — it is all there
  — to highlight what the Province has to offer. I am not so sure about poteen,
  but those are all part of our culture.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Newtownabbey Borough Council was faced with the possibility
  of seeing the demolition of a great mill at Mossley that had played a central
  part in the industrial revolution in Ireland. The council stepped in
  immediately and within a week had purchased the mill and decided to turn it
  into its new headquarters.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other areas in the UK are preserving their industrial
  heritage, and it is paying its way. A Lisburn man called Gregg developed the
  great mills at Hyde on the fringe of Manchester Airport, The National Trust is
  taking those over and fabricating and manufacturing items for the tourist
  industry. It is paying its way. The big spinning wheels and the steam turbines
  are all there and are being restored.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A similar project is going on at the mill village in
  Lanark, just outside Glasgow. People are still living in tenements in that
  area, but part of the mill has been converted into a hotel, and other parts
  have been restored to working order.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A private entrepreneur took over massive mills in Halifax
  in North England and developed them. They are so vast that one could not walk
  from one end to the other, but would require transport. An arts centre and all
  sorts of businesses and attractions, hotels and restaurants have been
  established there.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Bradford a large collection of old machinery has been
  restored — in fact, there is so much that it is being sold off to other
  museums throughout the UK. All those operations are in place to preserve our
  industrial heritage.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are proud of what we have done in Newtownabbey, because
  the industrial revolution in Ireland took off in the present boundaries of
  Newtownabbey Borough Council. I had to include that historic fact. We are
  attempting to preserve part of our heritage. That can be accomplished in many
  ways. Part of Mossley Mill could be restored and used as a museum. The mills
  in Benburb have been partially preserved but still need to be developed. These
  projects could be considered tourist attractions. We have an audience and a
  product that can be used to attract that audience.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Committee was preparing the report, it was
  discovered that most visitors to Northern Ireland come to see friends and
  relatives. People must be attracted for other reasons, such as over 450 varied
  attractions and many worthwhile sites. Leisure centres bring in many visitors,
  but there are also places of sound historic interest that can be used for
  tourism.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Titanic Quarter and the events down at the shipyard can
  be compared with extensive developments in Liverpool. Those might suggest that
  the Titanic was built there. The Titanic never visited Liverpool, but the
  White Star Line was associated with the city. The tender that brought people
  out from Cherbourg where the Titanic was anchored before it headed off across
  the Atlantic is now a disused floating restaurant on the River Seine in Paris.
  That could be brought back here to provide a focal point for tourism. There
  are many attractions that we could utilise.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am a believer in community-based tourism. No matter what
  community we consider, it has something of interest for tourism. It could be
  an inaccessible hidden rath. What is the sense in having such an attraction
  with no way to get to it? That is a problem throughout Northern Ireland. In my
  history research I have found that many attractions are not signposted and lie
  up a country lane or across a field. We must make those more accessible. We
  need to audit tourist products, both current and potential.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Tourist Board will continue to exist
  in one form or another despite what I have said. It is of the utmost
  importance that it promote Northern Ireland’s attractions comprehensively
  and accurately. At present, it is not doing so. Last night, I looked at a
  Tourist Board brochure. As I glanced through it, I was surprised to find that
  the information on certain historic attractions was not accurate. That is not
  good. The Tourist Board must ensure that it is accurate in its assessment of
  the attractions that it includes in its brochures.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The approach to promoting attractions should be more
  comprehensive. There should be an audited list of all the attractions that
  bring people to the Province. This is a good little Province. Despite all our
  problems, this place is worth living in. When King William came to Ireland he
  said that it was a place worth fighting for — we have been doing that ever
  since. However, we can put that in context and recognise that we are all
  citizens of this land. There is so much on offer. We ourselves are a product,
  and there are many things to attract people who have a genuine interest in
  some of the areas mentioned today.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have looked at only one aspect of tourism — industrial
  heritage. There is a market for that. I and other Committee members saw the
  evidence of that in a place called Lowell, about an hour’s drive from
  Boston, where they have developed the great mills and put the boat on the old
  canal. Almost by accident, they decided to install some tiered seating and
  hold a country and western event. It is now a massive occasion that attracts
  almost 250,000 people on a weekend.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The significant point about that project is that it is
  located in a downtown area that was falling apart and inhabited by drug
  addicts. It was not a place where respectable people would be seen, so
  something had to be done. The area was developed with the mills as the focal
  point. The place is tremendous — a basketball arena and an ice arena, which
  can also host concerts, were built. Facilities were provided to attract
  people.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever a community has to offer, it will have something
  that will attract people. It could be a place like Newtownabbey, which was the
  cradle of the industrial revolution. People are interested in the fact that we
  have preserved part of that heritage. Unfortunately, some of it has gone. What
  was perhaps the oldest factory chimney in Ireland was demolished to make way
  for a Toys ‘R’ Us store, which was a shame. There was no need to take away
  that chimney. People are attracted to such things. Do we do enough about that?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report makes 56 recommendations, including some on
  visitor centres and museums, in which I have an interest. We should consider
  those recommendations, which I commend to the Assembly. We recommend taking
  stock of our visitor attractions, heritage centres and other facilities. I
  urge the Assembly to accept the report’s recommendations, and not only
  because of the Committee’s hard work. However, it is because of that hard
  work that we have got the report right. The issues that it raises must be
  taken on board, not ignored or thrown out.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Wilson:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson and my Colleagues on the Committee for
  Culture, Arts and Leisure have already mentioned many aspects of the
  background to the inquiry, the need for the inquiry and the report. I wish to
  say a few words about one section of the report.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.45 pm</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before I do, I want to join with others in placing on
  record a word of thanks to the Chairperson. He did a sterling job, keeping us
  focused on the objective against many competing pressures. It was not easy,
  and it was a job well done. Also, I want to thank the Committee staff for
  their hard work and dedication. This was a substantial inquiry — one that
  was necessary and useful — and all the staff played a big part from start to
  finish.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to say a few words about Northern Ireland’s image,
  which has been mentioned briefly by others, and how that image relates to the
  task of promoting our culture and, I hope, attracting tourists. As was the
  case in the angling inquiry, some issues were mentioned again and again by
  almost everyone who made a submission. Our image was certainly one of those.
  In short, what came over time and time again was the comment: &quot;How can we
  compete, faced with the bad news stories about Northern Ireland?&quot; Blame
  was apportioned over a wide spectrum: the terrorists; the rioters on our
  streets; the criminality in our communities; and the murders. Even the news
  industry did not escape criticism.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many submissions noted that a major barrier to developing
  culture tourism is the persistence of a negative image of Northern Ireland. On
  the other hand, feedback from visitors suggests that they are impressed by how
  different the reality of Northern Ireland is from the image they see, hear and
  read on television, radio and newspapers.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw Members’ attention to recommendations 30 and 31.
  It is not just the media that have the job of telling the Northern Ireland
  story — it is a Government responsibility, and the responsibility of the
  Executive and the Assembly. As has been said, it is the responsibility of the
  Northern Ireland Tourist Board, and the film industry, the Arts Council and
  district councils also have a role in telling the Northern Ireland story.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who made submissions to the inquiry recognised that
  providing, promoting and marketing culture tourism against a backdrop of
  terrorism was and, to some extent, still is an uphill battle. However, on the
  positive side, they also said that when broadcasters and the film industry
  deal with Northern Ireland culture, they could focus more on its richness,
  variety, and beauty — tipping the scales so that the positive outweighs the
  negative. Collectively, all the providers of cultural activity need to work
  harder, in a cohesive and strategic fashion. Those who promote and manage
  Northern Ireland need to do more to emphasise the positive if we are to
  attract more tourists to enjoy our rich and varied culture.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One Member in particular has referred to the Northern
  Ireland Tourist Board, and there is no doubt that it did come in for some
  criticism. However, would the tourist boards of Wales, Scotland, England, or
  just across the border in the Republic of Ireland have done a better job
  through the 30 plus years of terrorism? I doubt it very much.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend this report to the Assembly. I know that the
  Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure will give it serious consideration.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s report can chart the future for cultural tourism
  for a great many years to come. It can help to bring an economic boost and
  rejuvenate tourism in the Province. A vast improvement can be made, but only
  if a co-ordinated plan is put together and acted upon.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The principal reason that people come to Northern Ireland
  is to visit friends and relatives. That is where we must start to increase
  tourism potential. Almost 45% of all people visiting the Province fall into
  that category. Many of us feel that tourism currently has no push or energy
  behind it. Therefore, it is vital that out-of-state cultural tourism is
  promoted aggressively and not in the namby-pamby way practised by the Northern
  Ireland Tourist Board up until now.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In tandem with aggressive tourism promotion, the local
  market must play its part with a quality arts sector, anxious to seize the
  potential for out-of-state visitors. Let us be perfectly honest: visitors do
  not come to Northern Ireland because they are seeking a &quot;sand and
  sun&quot; holiday; we cannot guarantee that. In Northern Ireland, we offer the
  growing niche market of cultural heritage and the arts.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Tourist Board has failed miserably to
  promote and market the Province and has been singularly responsible for the
  lost years of tourism growth and development. Let us look at the figures. Only
  1·8% of Northern Ireland’s gross domestic product comes from tourism, while
  the Republic of Ireland, Scotland and Wales all average approximately 6%. It
  is apparent that there is some catching up to do, and there is evidence that
  not much has been done for years.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The events of 11 September were a catalyst for the USA and
  the whole world. It is felt that a focus on the markets of Europe, Great
  Britain and the Republic of Ireland would be more advantageous. However, the
  USA can, and should, be a point for cultural tourism. American citizens are
  hungry to find their roots and hungry for history; that potential market
  cannot be ignored either.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need world-class events. The rest of Great Britain has
  several world-class and major international events. We must see a push to
  bring at least one or two events to the Province each year. While the
  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the roles of the Northern
  Ireland Tourist Board and Tourism Ireland Ltd must be clarified, and the
  benefits for our Province must then be taken advantage of, it is not enough to
  talk about what must be done. Let us see a clear strategy within specific
  goals to develop each sector.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is especially worrying that so many of the organisations
  giving evidence were critical of their dealings with the Northern Ireland
  Tourist Board. Most Members have referred to that. There has been a breakdown
  in the Tourist Board’s customer services, and failure to return phone calls
  or to respond to requests paints a very damming picture of it. District
  councils have an important part to play in promoting cultural tourism. In
  fairness to it, the Tourist Board has acknowledged that it could improve on
  what it is doing. We urge it to galvanise itself, grasp the nettle and
  actively promote cultural tourism.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have looked at the diversity of themes and sectors and
  at the responsibilities we have for our cultural heritage. How can we
  encourage a good quality of life for the whole community? Promotion and
  development could be undertaken by the cultural strategy for Northern Ireland.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cultural tourism can unlock many doors to benefit the
  entire Province, but that can only happen if the Department of Enterprise,
  Trade and Investment and the Tourist Board, as part of that Department, grasp
  the initiative collectively. Up until now, they have failed to do so. They
  should accept constructive criticism, accept that things have gone wrong in
  the past and move forward with zeal and enthusiasm so that all tangible
  benefits are grasped and made the most of. It is in front of us, like an apple
  ready to be picked, but we must get it right. That is more vital today than it
  has ever been. I commend the report’s recommendations to the House.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Davis:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference was made during a debate yesterday to empty
  Benches, and we have empty Benches again today. All Members in the Chamber,
  with the exception of Mr Gibson, are members of the Committee for Culture,
  Arts and Leisure. This is one of the most important reports to be brought
  before the Assembly. When we read the papers we cannot fail to see the words
  &quot;culture&quot;, &quot;arts&quot; and &quot;leisure&quot;, yet we see from
  the gathering today just how interested Members who are not on that Committee
  are. Indeed, there are more people in the Public Gallery than in the Chamber.
  However, I welcome the opportunity to comment on the report of the Committee’s
  inquiry into cultural tourism and the arts, and I will focus on the strategic
  planning and development section. That section says that the Tourist Board
  does not have an overall objective that shows what it is trying to achieve and
  what its limitations are. Every successful organisation needs to have a
  purpose, and the work of the organisation should be focused around it.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee took evidence from several organisations that
  referred to the poor performance of the Tourist Board. I note that its
  co-operative plan for 2002-05 has a vision of increasing the number of
  visitors by 7% each year over that period. The Committee hopes that the board
  will recognise the important part that culture can play in attracting more
  visitors to Northern Ireland. As a result, recommendation 40 says that</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">and what that would offer to tourism. The objective behind
  such a day would be to emphasise the importance of celebrating the wonderful
  culture that exists in Northern Ireland.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.00 pm</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is vital that the Department take the lead in pursuing
  that matter, working closely with other Departments and bodies. Various groups
  support the idea of a heritage day, and it has been suggested that the theme
  of the day could be changed annually to ensure that all cultural groups are
  supported and represented.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Tourist Board must undertake research to analyse and
  understand exactly what attracts visitors to our Province. By so doing, it
  will be able to determine what will encourage potential visitors in future,
  and thus it will be able to increase visitor numbers. That task must not be
  undertaken in isolation but in close conjunction with other relevant tourist
  bodies in mainland UK and the Republic of Ireland.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Departments, district councils, non-departmental public
  bodies, attraction operators, accommodation providers, transport undertakings,
  tour companies and other bodies, such as the National Trust and the Northern
  Ireland Events Company, must work together more effectively. In that respect,
  the creation of Tourism Ireland Ltd should promote greater co-operation and
  allow the Northern Ireland Tourist Board to invest greater energy and
  resources in promoting Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK and the Republic
  of Ireland.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The formation of formal local networks of cultural partners
  and tourist attraction operators is important. Those networks would develop
  theme-based package tours and trails, and they should be assisted by local
  tourism action plans, with attraction clusters within a specific locale that
  would allow visitors to have a range of cultural and heritage experiences.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report states that the Committee was encouraged by the
  work of the individual product groups and their working parties in the
  cultural tourism partnership. Specific action must be taken on the conclusion
  and strategies outlined in the 2002 progress report, including the development
  of networks and branding exercises. Recommendation 47 suggests that policies
  and measures should be monitored, evaluated and reviewed to allow for
  continual improvement in the industry, and appropriate structures should be
  established to allow for such improvement.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the members of the Committee, the Chairperson and
  the Deputy Chairperson for the work that they have put in, and I record my
  thanks to the Committee staff for their commitment and attention to detail. I
  hope that the Minister will give the report the serious consideration that it
  rightly deserves.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not a member of the Committee for Culture, Arts and
  Leisure, but I support the report. I have a long-time vested interest in
  cultural tourism. Many years ago, perhaps to my own discredit, I promoted, in
  the Omagh District Council area, the idea of basing a 51-mile trail on the
  inspirational points and places of W F Marshall, who was one of the first
  people to broadcast on the BBC in Northern Ireland. He was an academic of
  great power. He made a special contribution to the literary world by
  recognising that the area in which he lived in mid-Tyrone had a unique and
  distinctive dialect. So distinct was it, as indicated by his research, that W
  F Marshall was commissioned by the BBC to assist in the production of
  Shakespeare’s great play ‘As You Like It’ in the original language of
  Shakespeare, which is recognised as being the mid-Tyrone dialect. Given that
  vested interest and the strong call that was made for the retention of
  townlands, I commend the Committee on the excellent report.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, no methodology for retaining townlands was
  suggested. I have struggled with the issue for many years in my council area,
  where townlands have been eliminated and replaced by manufactured road names.
  I live seven miles from Omagh, in the village of Beragh. That seven-mile area
  is known by one name — Donaghanie — but it is made up of 11 townlands. I
  have encouraged Omagh District Council to insert the names of townlands in red
  print on road signs. It is a greater expense, but the council receives
  sponsorship for the project. A practical effort must be made.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have encouraged other community groups to use local
  stones to mark out townland boundaries, but permission for that is required
  from the Department of the Environment and the Department for Regional
  Development’s Roads Service. I know that the Minister would be interested in
  supporting that idea.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much criticism has been levelled at the Tourist Board, but
  everyone can contribute in his own area. Local pride and heritage can be
  brought to the fore and utilised as an important tourist product. In the town
  that I represent, the names of such musical geniuses as Dominic Kirwan, Brian
  Coll and numerous showbands are written large in history. The same applies to
  local poets such as John Montague, Benedict Kiely, Matt Mulcahy, R L Marshall
  and W F Marshall. Every area has similarly well-known people. Mid-Tyrone did
  not have tourism potential until it used the inspirational points of the
  51-mile Marshall trail through unspoilt, undiluted, unpolluted countryside.
  That rural quietude brings tranquillity to visitors from the concrete
  conurbations.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the report, and I advocate that the Minister
  encourage the practical, rather than aspirational, retention of townland
  names. It can be done, and I encourage him to treat the matter seriously.
  Northern Ireland obtained the concept of townlands from Sudan. The idea was
  imported during the third and fourth centuries, when Coptic traders arrived at
  the Shannon and other estuary rivers. Townlands are particular to Ireland and
  north Sudan. Let us retain a custom that is almost unique to Northern Ireland,
  so that we can give it a special focus as part of our cultural heritage.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McGimpsey):</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Committee’s report, and I acknowledge its
  breadth. Its 56 recommendations offer a means to maximise the potential of
  cultural tourism and the arts in Northern Ireland. It will come as no surprise
  to the House that, given the substantial number of recommendations and
  considering the short time that I have had the report, I shall want to give it
  more detailed consideration before I make my formal reply to the Committee.
  Moreover, some of the recommendations fall to other Ministers, and I shall
  wish to consult them before responding. However, by way of early comment, I
  welcome the Committee’s recognition of the importance of the arts in adding
  value to cultural tourism and of the extent to which the arts can enrich our
  lives and make positive economic and social contributions to the development
  of Northern Ireland.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recognition of culture as an economic generator is not a
  new concept. It is being employed in parts of Europe — Bilbao and Rotterdam
  spring to mind. It is a tool — an economic generator — that has been
  highly successful in those areas, and I am certain that we can use it to good
  effect in Northern Ireland. Many Members have mentioned the areas that we can
  utilise to create economic well-being as well as to enhance our image and
  self-esteem.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the Committee’s pragmatism in its approach
  to issues such as sustainability and long-term viability. We have already
  witnessed the difficulties that have occurred in projects such as the St
  Patrick Centre in Downpatrick and the Navan Centre in Armagh. The need for
  financial rigour, as well as intellectual rigour, for projects such as those
  is essential, and their absence will almost certainly lead to sustainability
  problems. The importance of properly addressing that issue is essential if
  some of the opportunities identified in the report are to be brought to
  fruition. Too often with such projects the capital investment can be found,
  but not enough consideration is given to the revenue consequences and the fact
  that many of the projects will create an annual revenue deficit for several
  years. If the number of visitors is not estimated realistically, we are liable
  to run into problems, as we have done at the Navan Centre and the St Patrick
  Centre.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure is addressing
  issues that are particularly relevant to it. Those include the welcome focus
  on the development of the Titanic Quarter and the telling of the Titanic
  story. With that in mind, I urge Committee members to visit the Thompson dry
  dock to see its potential and that of the surrounding area in order to promote
  Belfast’s industrial, maritime and aviation centre. For those who are not
  familiar with the story, the Thompson dry dock was built in 1910 and is an
  awesome piece of space. It was extended by 30ft to allow the Titanic to
  squeeze in, and it sits down there just as it was built. We should look at how
  we can develop that to retain the dry dock features and the pump house that
  sits alongside it and at how we can use it to tell the Titanic story. Belfast
  is the only city in the world that can tell that story.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">HMS Caroline is currently in the Alexandra dock. It is a
  1914, first world war, light cruiser built for the Royal Navy. It is the last
  survivor of the Battle of Jutland and is a priceless and irreplaceable
  artefact. The ship is of the Titanic era and built in Titanic fashion; much of
  it was rivet built. We have huge potential there, and I urge the Committee to
  look at that.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Next door to that, the Belfast Harbour Commissioners plan
  to develop a portion of the wharf to enable large cruise liners to dock in
  Belfast. We have all that potential sitting cheek by jowl with the science
  park. The Nomadic has been mentioned. Two tenders were especially built to
  carry passengers from Cherbourg out to the Titanic, and one of those was the
  Nomadic. It looks like a mini Titanic, and it would be a wonderful asset if it
  were situated in Belfast. However, the Department has looked at moving it from
  Paris, and there are major cost implications. Extra bridges have been built
  over the Seine, where it sits, and it would mean sinking the ship to take it
  below the bridges. There would be major engineering difficulties in retrieving
  the ship from Paris and major resource implications too. When it was being
  considered I envisaged difficulty in finding resources. However, the
  Department will keep it in mind.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Promoting the cultural quarter concept, art and public
  spaces, accessibility to arts facilities and the development of cultural
  product in theatre, dance and music are also to be welcomed as is the
  identification of roots tourism in the international genealogy market. The
  Public Records Office will play a central role in that. I recently hosted an
  event in the Long Gallery for overseas visitors for just that type of tourism.
  Digitising records will play a key role as they become an easily accessible
  resource through new technology to visitors to the Internet.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are ideas that the Public Records Office and other
  areas of the Department are very much aware of and aligned to. We feel
  strongly about getting new technology into various areas. The Assembly saw the
  first part of that initiative with the electronic libraries for Northern
  Ireland (ELFNI) project early in 2002. That was a £36 million contract to
  develop computer technology in all our libraries. That is a step forward
  because those computers will play a major part in future for genealogy and
  other interests that visitors might have.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, the Department is making progress on the
  development of language and the use of the arts to explore our common
  heritage, and I welcome, in principle, the identification of the need for a
  dedicated art gallery. However, that has a major cost implication, to which I
  shall return. I am pleased that the report acknowledged the importance of
  specific managed events alongside, for example, locally organised festivals to
  encourage tourism.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members referred to the importance of district
  councils. Much work is being done there. The Department is working through the
  cultural forum to ensure that each of the 26 district councils will have local
  cultural strategies that complement one another and have the Department of
  Culture, Arts and Leisure’s overall aims in its publications. That is
  happening and is an area of activity that will ensure that councils complement
  the Department’s aims as set out in ‘Face to Face’, the sector’s
  vision for arts, for culture and for unlocking creativity. The cultural forum
  has a key role to play in providing a broader approach to help deliver much of
  what is contained in the report.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy and others, such as Mr Gibson, talked about
  townland names. Recently, during Question Time, I referred to the common
  address file project, which will enable townland names to be added to
  addresses. The Department now has funding to get the common address file into
  operation, and that will ensure that Government Departments and councils use
  it initially and that there will be a ready bridge across from the townland
  names archive straight into the common address file. The Department has the
  means to do that — and it has the will to do it.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report’s recommendations on creative industry align
  with the Department’s work and with that of the interdepartmental creativity
  action group. In particular, support to enable the Northern Ireland Film and
  Television Commission to develop the sector is being pursued by my Colleagues
  and me through Executive programme funds. The Arts Council also fulfils a
  co-ordinating role in the craft sector, which, although it is not featured in
  the report, is another important element of cultural tourism. It appears that
  some issues are not covered in the report.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are all aware that money makes everything possible. The
  report rightly identified funding as being critical to future development.
  However, the report stopped short of quantifying any of the costs associated
  with the areas identified for the development and of offering any practical
  view on from where future funding might be obtained.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, the museum of sea and sky and the museum of
  creative arts could cost in the region of £100 million, as could the Ulster
  canal and the Lagan navigation projects combined. If the money were there, we
  could deliver everything that is contained in the report. However, we must
  live within our means, and expectations must be realistic.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are ways to find that money. We must be imaginative
  and inventive, but we must also understand that the Executive and Government
  cannot simply write cheques for those amounts. On top of the capital amount is
  the resource implication after construction. Those areas need careful
  examination and investigation. It taxes me greatly, but we are actively
  considering funding options. Unless the resources are found, we cannot deliver
  what we are talking about and looking for. We cannot satisfy expectations, but
  we are aware of the value of cultural tourism as an economic driver.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bid for 2008 Capital of Culture and the potential of
  sport as a key component of our culture did not feature in the report, nor is
  there any acknowledgement of the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast and the
  &quot;hub&quot; concept — something else on which we are actively working.
  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment is also conducting major
  tourism reviews. Several Members mentioned the Tourist Board. The Department
  takes the views expressed seriously. A major tourism review is under way, and
  Belfast City Council is also undertaking a review, but neither is mentioned in
  the report. I am sure that the Committee will be anxious to look at those
  reports when they are published.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is an important step forward. I commend the
  Committee for the effort that has gone into it. I shall give the Committee a
  detailed response to the report in due course, and I look forward to working
  closely with Committee members to see what might realistically be delivered.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome all the contributions made on the report and
  thank all Members for their time and consideration.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One issue that sprang to mind from several contributions,
  especially that of the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee, was the definition
  of culture. She used the UNESCO definition, which reminded me of the visit
  that some Committee members made to Kanturk to attend a culture conference in
  County Cork. At the conference, an academic from Wales described culture as
  &quot;the central thing&quot;. She also said that in Welsh, the closest
  interpretation of the word for &quot;culture&quot; describes the move from
  being wild to being civilised. That is an interesting concept about culture
  and its meaning.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The enthusiasm with which Committee members have responded
  to the report in this debate indicates the level of work that the Committee
  had undertaken. I thank them once again for all that work.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson mentioned a good example of where
  we, as a community, can fail in dealing with the concept of cultural tourism
  when she mentioned the Pennsylvanian millionaires.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a great pity that such opportunities — and we know
  of many — go a-begging because we have no facility to take advantage of
  them.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Nelis rightly highlighted the Northern Ireland Tourist
  Board’s annual summary of attractions. Although the Committee was concerned
  about the clear shortcomings of that important data, it was more concerned
  about the board’s method of gathering it. The report emphasises that that
  methodology must be examined and improved. The Tourist Board wrote to various
  organisations to request information, but it published only the details that
  it was given. That procedure is hardly suitable to provide an educated and
  scientific understanding of what is happening.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ian Adamson’s insight and knowledge made a tremendous
  contribution to our debate and the preparation of the report. He spoke
  accurately about the alienation and break-up of communities and the lack of
  proper regeneration strategies. The definition of alienation as &quot;the
  absence of culture&quot; was also heard in Kanturk. That is an interesting
  thought. Dr Adamson highlighted the importance of making an inventory of our
  heritage, built and otherwise. Without that proper identification, we cannot
  preserve and care for the most important elements of our heritage. Local
  trails and tours were among the recommendations that the Committee sought.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">David Hilditch referred to the criticism that was made of
  the Tourist Board. A pattern of criticism ran throughout the report, and it is
  right that Members should highlight it. The Tourist Board had major problems
  in addition to the current criticisms of it. The criticism was made by those
  who gave evidence, rather than by Committee members. Mr Hilditch was correct:
  almost everyone had a criticism to make. I recall only one positive comment,
  and that may have come from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland. The report
  might have included a few criticisms of that body. The Committee reflects the
  weight of evidence, and it is part of its job to listen to practitioners and
  other witnesses, put together their views coherently and constructively and
  present them to the Minister and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kieran McCarthy, whom we all recognise as the champion of
  townland names, again made a good case. Unfortunately, Oliver Gibson is not
  present, but I thank him for his interesting and valuable contribution. It
  would be good if townlands could be incorporated into rural road signs to
  inform a traveller that he is leaving one townland and entering another. Mr
  Gibson said that our suggestion was aspirational; on the contrary, it was a
  clear and definite recommendation of usage by all Departments and official
  organs. That is not aspirational; it is practical. Its achievement would be a
  major step towards our goal. The Minister correctly referred to the common
  address file project, and the Committee recommended that that be supported.
  Once that is in place, there will be no excuse for not using townland names.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.30 pm</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Frazer Agnew spoke with considerable passion about the poor
  record that we have for preserving and restoring our old linen mills and
  machinery. A great deal of work is happening elsewhere to preserve such
  heritage, but we seem to be relentless in our neglect of the infrastructure,
  and Mr Agnew’s comments reflect the Committee’s concerns.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Agnew also made a telling point about the accessibility
  of heritage sites. We are not very good at signposting, but if we put our
  minds to it, we should be able to address those problems.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jim Wilson concentrated on our image problem.
  Internationally, what image do people have of us? What films do they see that
  are made in Northern Ireland about Northern Ireland? What documentaries do
  they see? Unfortunately, the negative image invariably comes across, and Mr
  Wilson is right to draw our attention to that. Reported news must be the
  truth, but the Committee’s report attempts to get people to focus on the
  positive qualities of life here.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jim Shannon made an interesting contribution and, once
  again, demonstrated the wealth of cultural diversity here by using Ulster
  Scots in his introduction. I thank him for that. He referred to the need for a
  cultural strategy to set goals and objectives and to galvanise all those
  involved.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ivan Davis referred to the low attendance during most of
  the debate. I was delighted to hear that the Republic of Ireland won 3 – 0,
  and I congratulate the team. It is hard to blame Members who wanted to watch
  the match, but we cannot use that excuse every day on which attendance is low.
  More Members are here now — perhaps something of interest is to begin
  shortly.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ivan Davis also highlighted the idea of a heritage day. I
  hope that people consider that closely as a neat recommendation that could do
  much to create the image that we want to project, as opposed to the negative
  image that we have.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his full attention. I recognise
  his interest in the Committee’s work and thank him for his support for the
  majority of our recommendations. He commented on the financial implications of
  some of them, and it seemed as though he had not considered fully the
  financial recommendations that we made. However, when the Committee considers
  them more closely with the Department, the Minister may realise that they
  contain a lot of financial detail. We hope to widen the possibilities because
  the funding recommendations contain opportunities for us to consider
  imaginative approaches. We recognise that the proposals could be expensive,
  but many of the recommendations could be fulfilled at little cost. We need to
  focus our resources and commitment better on what we want to achieve. It is
  possible. I commend the report.</p>

            </b>
  <center>
  <font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received notice from the Minister for Employment and
  Learning that she wishes to make a statement on an incident at the Belfast
  Institute of Further and Higher Education’s Tower Street campus on 7 June
  2002.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Employment and Learning (Ms Hanna):</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to make a brief statement about the events at a
  campus of the Belfast Institute of Further and Higher Education last week.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At around 11.00 am on Friday 7 June, an incident occurred
  at the Tower Street campus of the Belfast Institute of Further and Higher
  Education during which staff and students were subjected to disgraceful and
  degrading behaviour. I understand that the details of the incident are under
  investigation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland, and for that reason I
  do not wish to engage in any discussion of them. I am sure that the Assembly
  will join me in unequivocally condemning the incident and in demanding respect
  for the essential neutrality of all educational establishments.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our society has suffered extensively from civil disorder
  for over three decades. We should be thankful that during that time, with a
  few notable exceptions, universities, colleges and schools have been allowed
  to carry out their task of educating children, young people and more mature
  students without fear or favour. That has particularly been the case in
  respect of further education, which by its nature provides educational
  opportunities to all sections of the community in its numerous campuses and
  outreach centres.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That neutrality was breached on Friday morning, when staff
  and students were interrupted by an incursion by people from outside whose
  interest was palpably not in further education and training. Such behaviour
  has no place in any decent society and no place in the neutral surroundings of
  any educational establishment.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At a time when the stresses and strains of examinations
  should be the only consideration for students and staff, it is unacceptable
  that any institution should have to close its buildings, reschedule its
  examinations and help staff and students cope with the experience of sectarian
  threats. The Assembly should be united in its unequivocal condemnation of the
  events of last Friday.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that the experiences of staff and students will not
  deflect any of them from achieving the grades and results that they need for
  their careers or their educational progress. My thoughts, support and sympathy
  go out to the management, staff and students of the Tower Street campus.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appeal to the communities in east Belfast, and, indeed,
  in all areas, to preserve the essential neutrality of educational
  establishments, which are designed to meet their needs irrespective of
  religion or political opinion. I am heartened by the fact that several local
  community leaders have already visited the Tower Street campus to express
  their regret that such an incident took place and to demonstrate their support
  for the staff and students. I will visit the campus when the management and
  staff consider it appropriate.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I conclude by reiterating my unequivocal condemnation of
  that action and by underlining the principle of respect for the neutrality of
  educational establishments.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and
  Learning: (Dr Birnie)</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very pleased that the Minister has made her statement,
  and I concur with what she said. I also agree with the statement of one of the
  relevant teachers’ unions, the NASUWT, on 10 June, that the action was
  reprehensible because of the successful way in which further education
  colleges have integrated Protestant and Catholic students over many years.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will it be necessary for the Belfast Institute of Further
  and Higher Education and other further education colleges around the Province
  to take extra security measures? If that is the case, what are the budgetary
  implications, and how would the Department respond to the extra financial
  strain?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that this is an isolated incident. No one wants to
  make fortresses out of colleges or any educational establishments. All
  colleges consider their security requirements and take whatever steps are
  necessary to protect staff and students in their local communities. The
  college at Tower Street has already engaged one further security person. I am
  not aware of the financial implications.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The behaviour referred to is completely unacceptable. I
  draw attention to an incident in the Holy Land area of Belfast where an attack
  on a young student from County Fermanagh, Marius Rooney, took place. He is
  still seriously ill, and I am sure all Members hope that he will make a good
  recovery. Does the Minister agree that that behaviour is reprehensible and
  that we need to redouble our efforts to bring those who carry out such attacks
  to justice?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sadly, attacks on individuals are increasing. I know of the
  attack on that young man about 10 days ago. He is still seriously ill. I do
  not know the circumstances, but I am aware that some of the attacks have
  sectarian undertones. Some of them are just a sad reflection of the increase
  in crime on our streets. I agree with the Member that we totally and utterly
  condemn all these attacks, regardless of motive.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all concur that such behaviour is unacceptable. I would
  highlight the difference in attitudes between the Minister for Employment and
  Learning and the Minister of Education when schoolchildren wearing their
  school uniforms were attacked in Strabane by so-called supporters of the Irish
  football team.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When schoolchildren could not enter Londonderry city centre
  because they were wearing certain school uniforms the Minister of Education
  did not appear before the House. I thank the Minister for Employment and
  Learning for bringing this matter to the House and making it clear that
  sectarianism is unacceptable in the school place and that sectarian attacks on
  schoolchildren are also unacceptable. I wish the Minister of Education would
  take a leaf out of the book of the Minister for Employment and Learning.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sectarian attacks are wrong and unacceptable, regardless of
  the location or the person involved.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.45 pm</p>
  </i><b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Nelis:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Has the
  Minister been advised that this is not the first instance of students and
  staff being threatened at the Belfast Institute of Further and Higher
  Education’s Tower Street campus? The fine arts examination was cancelled.
  Will the Minister give special consideration to their students who will have
  to resit their examinations? What measures did the board of governors have in
  place to protect the students and staff, who had to lock themselves in
  classrooms for protection?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most examinations were relocated to other campuses. I
  assume that special arrangements will be made for any students who were unable
  to sit their examinations.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not aware of any other attacks on Tower Street, but I
  am conscious that, sadly, over the past 30 years there have been at least five
  brutal attacks on people in education establishments. A headmaster was killed
  in his classroom, a school bus driver was killed and a classroom was
  booby-trapped, resulting in the death of a policeman. Lecturer Edgar Graham
  was killed outside Queen’s University, and a lecturer at the Magherafelt
  campus of the North East Institute of Further and Higher Education was
  murdered in his classroom. Perhaps even more such sad events have occurred.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for the statement, but I am concerned
  that, given the serious nature of the incident, the statement was not made in
  the House yesterday. The fact that young students were lined up against a wall
  and asked their religion, no matter what that religion might be, shows the
  depths to which this society has sunk. Will the Minister co-operate with the
  Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Education because this matter
  concerns agencies other than her own Department?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Signs are being put up on the walls on the routes to the
  college and to schools that say &quot;No Taigs from Short Strand beyond this
  point&quot;. If such signs were put up referring to Protestants, every Member
  would condemn them.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">School principals have told me that they are concerned that
  this September students will not attend the Tower Street campus and that they
  may have to find courses elsewhere. Principals are concerned that these young
  students have only one option and that they now have nowhere to go. What
  arrangements has the Minister put in place to address this problem?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alternative arrangements have been made for staff and
  students. I expect that special arrangements will be made for all those
  students. I will personally look into the matter if there is a problem. I
  apologise that the statement was not made yesterday.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The atmosphere is very tense in some parts of Northern
  Ireland, especially in Belfast. I will co-operate with all Departments and do
  anything I can to alleviate that tension.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Adamson:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join with the Minister in condemning the appalling
  incident at the Belfast Institute of Further and Higher Education in Tower
  Street. In the light of our common concern for neutrality in our education
  establishments, what steps are being taken to ensure that Queen’s University
  and its Students’ Union become less of a cold house for Protestants and
  Unionists?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is up to everyone, especially those of us in leadership
  roles, to work together to ensure that all students feel comfortable in all
  our establishments.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The incident in Tower Street highlights the whole issue of
  sectarianism in this city and throughout our society, and this House must take
  the matter seriously. We must address it vigorously, as if it were a disease
  that affects us all. It is insufficient to respond to one incident. We must
  develop a strategy for dealing with sectarianism no matter where it manifests
  itself — in the classroom, in colleges, or in the street. We must deal with
  it.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has emphasised the sacrosanct nature of
  neutrality in an educational establishment. Is there any danger, as a result
  of this sectarian incident, that the future of the Tower Street campus might
  be under threat? Also, will those students whose examinations have had to be
  relocated get a sympathetic marking to compensate for the trauma that they
  clearly and manifestly went through as a result of this incident?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no question of relocating the Tower Street campus,
  and I would expect any students experiencing difficulties with their
  examinations because of this incident to get a sympathetic hearing.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sectarianism is a contagious disease in this society.
  Unfortunately, we have a certain tolerance of a level of sectarianism in our
  everyday life, and we must proactively work together if we are to eradicate
  this disease.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise sincerely to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and to
  the House for my mobile phone ringing unceremoniously this afternoon.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am heartened, as the Minister is, by the fact that some
  local community leaders have already visited Tower Street campus to express
  their regret that such an incident should take place, and have offered their
  support to all the staff and students. One has to condemn any sort of
  irresponsibility from whatever gang, or from wherever, and any form of
  intimidation. If such behaviour escalates, then there is trouble ahead.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This may be beyond the Minister’s remit; it is more to do
  with education. For many years, students from controlled schools in County
  Fermanagh have suffered intimidation when going home on school buses to border
  areas. Undoubtedly, this has eased a little, but it has been a difficult
  situation for many of them.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister aware of the intimidation that grammar
  school pupils suffered recently in Strabane when the Republic won its football
  match? I congratulate the Republic on the win, but some people are using and
  abusing the situation.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of us are aware of issues of sectarianism in our
  communities. It is not any respecter of place, person, or religion — it
  happens in all areas and to all people. However, until we work together,
  seriously and proactively, we will not eradicate this scourge.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I concur with the Minister’s sentiments. Will she offer
  to us her knowledge of the police assessment that she must have received on
  any paramilitary involvement in the attack on the Tower Street campus? Since
  she is unable to give us details of previous attacks, will she also confirm
  why we should have had such an occurrence after thirty years of nothing?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister look at the constituency in which Tower
  Street falls? Will she consider that conditions may have existed that
  certainly do not encourage me to condone what happened, but which may be a
  symptom rather than a cause? There is a greater cause; is the Minister aware
  of it?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said that an investigation by the Police Service of
  Northern Ireland is taking place, so it would not be appropriate to comment on
  that.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why is this happening? It is happening because we have a
  problem with sectarianism in this society. I hope that everyone would join me
  in condemning unequivocally this outrageous incident, regardless of any
  background, &quot;what abouts&quot; or &quot;wherefores&quot;.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s initiative in making a statement
  on this issue, and I support the content of her statement. Elected
  representatives have a duty to speak out on issues, whether it is convenient
  for them to do so or not. The intimidation of people who are attempting to get
  an education is reprehensible. I am sure that the whole House accepts that
  that procedure is totally unacceptable in any civilised society. Therefore, I
  have no reservation in my condemnation.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has expressed the hope that it would be an
  isolated incident; that is also my hope. My hope is somewhat raised by the
  fact that all of my findings suggest that there was nothing organised about
  this event. There appears to have been no involvement of any paramilitary
  organisation. It is more likely to be the result of the reaction of people in
  the area, which is currently tense as a result of the IRA-orchestrated
  violence in that part of east Belfast. Like the Minister, I trust that there
  will be no reoccurrence of the incident and that there will be no detriment to
  the education of the people involved.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Member’s statement and his unequivocal
  condemnation of this act.</p>

  Memorials</a></p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
  </font></b><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly rejects the offensive trend of erecting
  memorials throughout Northern Ireland by Republican elements in memory of
  terrorists who tortured citizens of this state for decades by their campaign
  of murder, maiming and destruction and calls upon the Executive to take
  immediate action to remove those memorials which have been erected without
  permission.</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is important to the many relatives of those who
  were foully murdered by the terrorists who held this land to ransom for many
  years.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The erection of forms of memorial to those who for decades
  wrought havoc and destruction on the people of this state is, at least, highly
  offensive, in-your-face and profoundly insulting. It is uncaring,
  uncompassionate and grossly irresponsible. It is an offensive taunt to a
  community which has suffered broken hearts, broken limbs and broken homes and
  been left with heartbroken widows, mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters and
  many orphans.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin still lauds, and associates with, the gunman and
  the murderer, despite the fact that its members now act in Government here in
  Stormont, as Ministers acting on behalf of Her Majesty The Queen in this part
  of her realm.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The preponderance of different types of memorials in
  Fermanagh intends to rile and hurt. The memorials are not intended for the
  purposes of respect — only for abuse. The most terrible lie is not that
  which is uttered but that which is lived.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be a plea on behalf of heroes today, but can
  anyone in the Chamber who professes adherence to a faith and belief in the
  Living Lord call terrorists &quot;heroes&quot; or &quot;sons of the
  brave&quot;? Could those who blew two of my colleagues to pieces outside
  Enniskillen one night many years ago be called heroes? I remember Alfie
  Johnston and Jimmy Eames well.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What about the terrorists who murdered Mrs Bullock at her
  doorway, and then went into her home and murdered her husband Tommy? What
  about those who went into the Earl of Erne County Primary School at Teemore
  and murdered the school principal, George Saunderson, as he had a cup of tea?
  What about those who murdered Alexander Abercrombie as he sat on his tractor,
  or those who murdered Willie Burleigh when he attended an auction? What about
  those who bravely murdered Tommy John Fletcher at Garrison, or those who
  murdered John McVitty at Magheraveely as he did his farming chores? What about
  those who brutally murdered my cousin, Charlie Johnston, in cold blood near St
  Anne’s Cathedral as he, a director of a travel agency in Waring Street,
  walked to his work? What about those who set off the Enniskillen bomb on
  Remembrance Day in 1987? I was present at the cenotaph on that day of carnage.
  Two people died in my hands. I tried to console them as they bled to death.
  Twelve people died in that atrocity.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What about the terrorists who caused the La Mon House Hotel
  hell-on-earth inferno? What about the Shankill Road bomb, Teebane Cross, the
  Ballygawley bus bomb, the murder of the soldiers at Narrow Water Castle, or
  the Kingsmills murders? What about all the individual murders that have taken
  place over the years? What about the Omagh bomb activists, who may eventually
  seek to be called heroes at some time in the future?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had ethnic cleansing in my constituency of Fermanagh and
  South Tyrone. I have only referred to some of the many dastardly acts of
  murder and aggression perpetrated on citizens of that community by terrorists
  over the years — terrorists who are now being hailed as heroes by Sinn Féin.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Terrorists — either so-called Loyalists or Republicans
  — can never be accorded hero status by any decent individual. It is grossly
  offensive and insulting to many people in Northern Ireland.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Hassard and Love families in the Belleek area of
  Fermanagh are grievously mortified by the erection of the memorial to
  terrorists beside where their loved ones were assassinated coming home from
  doing an honest day’s work. Is that action not in-your-face offensive? I
  must emphasise that point — it certainly is in-your-face offensive.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since then, another memorial has been erected in
  Enniskillen to the memory of Bobby Sands. It is on the site where a memorial
  to those who died during the famine had been solemnly dedicated a couple of
  years ago. The words &quot;respect&quot;, &quot;honesty&quot; and
  &quot;decency&quot; are not in the thinking of Republicanism — they never
  were, and they never will be. This is just about Sinn Féin becoming the
  largest anti-British party in Northern Ireland at the expense of anyone who
  gets in its way. It has no scruples; it rides roughshod over the feelings of
  everyone, regardless of the hurt caused.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate that the blood relatives of those who have
  lost their lives mourn the deaths of their loved ones. However, it seems that
  that mourning should only happen when Sinn Féin dictates and in a way that it
  determines. That is shameful. Does anyone believe that the erection of a
  memorial to a terrorist on unhallowed ground will ease the pain for the
  relatives? Is that sacrilege?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Republicanism does that to seek political gain at the
  expense of the relatives who mourn the death of their flesh and blood. What
  sacrilege is being played out by those who profess innocence while making
  lying accusations of harassment in Northern Ireland?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been prepared to give those who have sinned in the
  eyes of the Almighty the opportunity to show repentance and remorse for their
  association with evil deeds over the past decades — for the well-being of
  this state and within the family of Britons. They have failed miserably to do
  so. They have been given a chance to redeem themselves and to show good,
  honest citizenship. But no — they want their pound of flesh, and they
  disregard the feelings of those around them.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They have been given the opportunity to serve in Executive
  positions in the Assembly, despite the fact that over the years they have
  associated with those who endeavoured to destroy this country, burned its
  towns and villages, and murdered and maimed our people. I say to them: look at
  the hands of those you call heroes. They are stained with the blood of our
  loved ones and their loved ones. Can they have a conscience at all? Can they
  barefacedly go on with their deceit and unadulterated, undiluted hypocrisy?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those people have ignored at least three Departments —
  and, indeed, law and order — in their erection of offensive memorials.
  However, they expound here regularly, superficially filled with pretence about
  other issues. The Department of the Environment — my former Department —
  the Department for Regional Development, and the Department of Agriculture and
  Rural Development must ensure that their responsibilities are not eroded and
  overrun by Republican stridency. The Department for Social Development is also
  involved. Departments cannot be seen to fail their remit or their
  responsibilities.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monuments, by their very nature, are political statements.
  Those wildcat memorials are inimical to the healing process that Sinn Féin
  purports to espouse. They stir up hatreds, bitter memories, and fears and
  feelings that we all hoped that we could leave behind.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Evidence of Sinn Féin’s being involved in stirring up
  community strife in places such as north Belfast, its involvement with the
  terrorists and drug dealers of FARC in Colombia, and its active links with
  other international terrorist groups, all of which is attested to by
  independent outside bodies and not only Unionist political comment, points to
  a real Sinn Féin agenda at total variance with its professed aim of healing
  our society. It is, unfortunately, an agenda of perpetuating strife. It is war
  by other means, at the expense of the heartbreak of citizens mourning their
  loved ones. How shameful can they get? How base can they become? There is an
  old Spanish proverb that says:</p>

  </font><b><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
  </font></b><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received one amendment to the motion, which is
  published on the Marshalled List.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move the following amendment: In line 1, delete
  all after &quot;Assembly&quot; and insert:</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;recognises the sensitivities involved on all sides in
  respect of the commemoration of those who have lost their lives in the
  conflict here, and calls upon the Executive in consultation with the relevant
  bodies, including the Victims Unit, the Community Relations Council, the
  Equality Commission and the Human Rights Commission to provide guidelines so
  that memorials of whatever kind conform to agreed criteria, and do not give
  offence.&quot;</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to explain to the House what my party finds
  inadequate in the motion. To begin with, the motion mentions</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the offensive trend of erecting memorials… by
  Republican elements&quot;,</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">when, clearly, it is not only Republicans who erect
  offensive monuments.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion goes on, in emotional terms, to describe in a
  one-sided way what we all know to be the suffering of all our people. My party
  finds that unacceptable. The motion calls on the Executive to take
  &quot;immediate action&quot;. Our amendment acknowledges that there is more to
  the matter than asking the Executive to storm in and remove those monuments.
  That approach is not satisfactory, and, therefore, we cannot support the
  motion.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our amendment advocates a more proactive, equal, fair and
  genuine way of attempting to deal with the problem. If we wish to solve the
  problem, we must come up with a sensible way to deal with it. That is why we
  have included the bodies and responsible people listed in the amendment. Our
  conflict has been unique. It is vital that we consider the sensitivities of
  all those who wish to remember their dead.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP has no general ingrained objection to memorials.
  The problem arises when those monuments cause offence to other people within
  or without a community. We have a sad tradition in our society of being
  offended by the actions of others. That is not the way in which the SDLP wants
  to see our community continue. A serious human rights issue is at stake.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To erect monuments in a manner that is not conducive to the
  pledges made in the Good Friday Agreement is to fail the commitment to peace;
  to insist on erecting monuments where they do not have the full support of
  local people is to be destructive of the Good Friday Agreement’s values; to
  erect those monuments illegally on public grounds and to ignore the
  implications is a clear disregard of the principles of the Good Friday
  Agreement.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some time ago, a Republican monument was erected in
  Downpatrick without any reference to the council on whose land it was built.
  In an attempt to deal with the issue, the council asked someone to take
  responsibility for it. No one would. It is unfair to put a public body in such
  a position, and whoever was responsible had no regard for how it would affect
  others. The council, mindful of the sensitive nature of the situation, decided
  to deal with it step by step. It consulted the Equality Commission for
  Northern Ireland. The commission’s interesting response stated:</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Under Article 28 of the Fair Employment and Treatment
  (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 it would be unlawful for the council to
  discriminate in a manner in which it provides services. This would include
  access to council-owned parks. It is the Commission’s view that the presence
  in a public park of an emblem or display such as this monument, which is
  directly linked to the community conflict over the past 30 years, could be
  regarded as offensive by some members of the community. As such, the council
  could be challenged under the above Order.&quot;</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commission’s response also stated:</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act also requires
  the council, in carrying out its functions, to have due regard to the need to
  promote equality of opportunity between certain individuals and groups.
  Without prejudice to this obligation, councils are also required to have
  regard to the desirability of promoting good relations between persons of
  different religious beliefs, political opinion or racial group. The council
  would need to consider whether the presence of such a monument could be
  perceived as marking out territory and thus inhibit the use of this park by
  all of the community. In our view there would be particular problems from a
  good relations perspective if the council were to allow such displays in its
  facilities.&quot;</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a clear statement of the problems that
  unauthorised, illegal structures create.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A similar monument to the one in Downpatrick was then
  erected in the town where I live, Castlewellan. Planning permission was
  applied for. I asked whether it had been proofed against the human rights and
  equality legislation vis-a-vis the Equality Commission’s opinion that I have
  just quoted. It had not. The irony was that Sinn Féin members of the council
  — in a clear contradiction of their responsibility as publicly elected
  officials — supported that. It was a clear indication that, for them, party
  politics came before the welfare of the community. They have treated human
  rights and equality with total contempt despite their supposed allegiance to
  equality — they are interested in &quot;themselves alone&quot;.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said that I would support remembrances as part of the
  healing process, and that is the SDLP’s policy. I also said that I would
  have no objection to a monument that had the full support of the community,
  the Human Rights Commission and the equality agenda.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a radio programme, I publicly asked the Sinn Féin
  representative for South Down, Mick Murphy, if he would join me in supporting
  a monument in Castlewellan to all those who had suffered and died in our area,
  instead of the one he proposed, and he publicly refused. What else can one
  say? He was only interested in a monument for &quot;themselves alone&quot;.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we want to deal with equality as an issue and an agenda
  to be followed, we must practise what we preach, and we must be seen to do it.
  There is no point in talking in lofty terms about equality while doing the
  exact opposite on the ground and, as I have said, treating equality with the
  contempt of which I have local experience. Therefore, in an attempt to deal
  with this growing problem it is necessary to bring all those agencies on board
  in order to get a coherent, sensible, fair and equal way of dealing with that.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now that I have a fuller picture of the number of Members
  who wish to speak — and it may yet change again — I advise Members to
  limit their contributions to eight minutes.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. Individuals, communities and
  societies like to mark and remember milestones in their history, and that is
  accepted across the world. However, the misuse of that which is being
  undertaken by those who any civilised society would look upon as fascist thugs
  is unacceptable. It is akin to erecting a memorial to Adolf Hitler, whom Sinn
  Féin/IRA backed, or putting up a memorial to Myra Hindley after her death.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A civil war is not being commemorated — it is not a war
  in any legitimate sense of the word. Memorials are being erected to common
  criminals who have killed innocent people across the Province. They are being
  erected to people who are nothing more than vagabonds who have raped and
  pillaged their way across the entire community and country and murdered
  workers, schoolteachers, children, women, fathers and husbands in a dirty,
  grubby, filthy and rotten campaign.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Memorials have been erected for people who have killed the
  likes of 17-month-old Colin Nicholl and two- year-old Tracey Munn in 1971 —
  that was a brave act. It is repugnant to decent people that a group of brutal
  terrorists are commemorated, the sort of thugs who murdered George Saunderson,
  the school principal, in Erne County Primary School in 1974. My constituency
  of Newry and Armagh has suffered much of the brunt of Republican Sinn Féin/IRA
  terrorism — Kingsmills, Glenanne and other incidents have been mentioned
  today.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anthony Nolan, an IRA activist who was nothing more than a
  common thief, accidentally shot himself while planning a bank robbery; he is
  some hero. Is he the type of person who deserves to be remembered? Bateson,
  Sheridan and Lee killed themselves while transporting a bomb to kill innocent
  people. On that occasion, the evil that they planned for others was turned on
  them.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Memorials erected to cowards who shot people in the dark
  and crawled up laneways to murder in the dark is not only repugnant and
  obscene, but a daily affront to everyone who went about their ordinary
  business decade after decade while those gangsters and hoods did everything
  possible to murder them in their beds or at work. That is what is being
  glorified across this country. If we were to erect a memorial to every
  citizen, soldier and policeman murdered by those thugs, there would not be
  enough land for them all.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What makes those shrines offensive is the glorification of
  violence and bloodshed. They are tasteless, tactless and obscene. However,
  what do we expect from IRA/Sinn Féin? In contrast, the memorial to the nine
  civilians who were murdered on the Shankill Road consists of a street lamp.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My constituency of Newry and Armagh has borne much of the
  brunt of IRA terrorism. Outside Belfast, Armagh has had the highest number of
  deaths. Republicans were responsible for 2,140 of the 3,636 deaths in Northern
  Ireland up to 1999 — around 60% of those murders. They are responsible for
  all the deaths, because there would have been no deaths but for them. The
  Assembly must not forget that for every two Protestants that the IRA killed
  they also murdered one Roman Catholic.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whom did those heroes murder? People like Frank Murphy, who
  was murdered while driving a school bus for Drumsallen Primary School outside
  Armagh; William Elliott, a post office inspector; Henry Dickson, a train
  driver; and Tracy Doak. I am sure that none of us can forget the 1995
  documentary about Tracy entitled ‘No Time to Say Goodbye’. There is not
  enough paper to record the pain and anguish caused by Republican terrorists.
  It is, therefore, morally repugnant to remember any of those murderers. The
  Executive and the Minister of the Environment must take action.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly must do something to represent the innocent
  victims: people from both sides of the community who have suffered so much at
  the hands of terrorists; people who across the Province went about their daily
  duties and worked to the best of their abilities to look after their families
  and friends. They were stopped with such cowardice by terrorists across
  Northern Ireland. I speak to many victims who find it soul-destroying to see
  those memorials and to see terrorists being glorified for the bloodshed and
  violence that they caused across the community. Action must be taken to deal
  with those memorials; the relevant Department must remove them immediately.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened to Mr ONeill with interest. He stated that he
  would not support the motion. That is a matter of grave concern. It was of
  greater concern that he suggested that all victims’ names could be on the
  same monument when he spoke about Downpatrick. I assure the House that the
  victims that I have spoken to do not, in any way, want their loved ones’
  names beside those of the murderers who carried out such cowardly attacks. I
  state that clearly.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Action must be taken on behalf of all innocent people who
  suffered at the hands of terrorists. The motion is about Republican terrorists
  who have caused so much distress and anguish and who committed many murders
  across the Province. The last thing that the DUP wants to see is them being
  glorified for the terrorist, cowardly, bloodthirsty acts that they have
  carried out throughout the Province during the past 30 years.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The motion is
  lopsided: it covers only one side of the story, which is no more than one
  would expect. Mr Foster is one of the movers of the motion. It seems that he
  has gone back into councillor mode. He was in that mode the last time that I
  remember being in such a debate with him. He is obviously spoiling for such a
  debate.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment says that memorials should
  &quot;conform&quot; to agreed criteria. What are those criteria? However,
  there is not as much to argue against in the amendment as there is in the
  motion. No one to whom equality is important could support the motion. It does
  not reflect how the Assembly should approach the issue of memorials. The
  arguments presented so far are not the way to deal with the memorials issue.
  They can only make matters much worse.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The number of attacks on Republican memorials in Fermanagh
  and other areas is proof that all we can do is make the situation much worse.
  Paint has been poured on monuments and cars have been set on fire. One
  Unionist councillor asked that all monuments be blown to bits — so much for
  his signature to using non-violent methods. His words were followed by an
  attack on a monument the following night. There has been one attack only on
  British war memorials in Moy. If I am wrong, perhaps someone can put me right
  on that.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has not been a two-way process. The motion is about one
  side; it is only about seeing victims as being on one side. That has been the
  argument on everything relating to victims. We often hear about the conflict
  of the past 30 years. Anybody who knows his history knows that the reasons
  behind the conflict go back to the inception of this particular statelet and
  the way that it was run from the start. Nationalists were entirely left out of
  the picture and had no part in ruling this part of Ireland. That is the
  backdrop for all this. It has nothing to do with the past 30 years in
  particular.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One need only go to any town or village, however small, in
  the North to see British war memorials in every one. Most of them cost a
  sizeable amount of money. Recently, £19,000 was spent in Enniskillen to just
  update the names on a memorial. We in Fermanagh District Council did not
  oppose that. Who was consulted about the original cenotaphs? Whose permission
  was asked? Did the original Stormont Government give permission for the
  erection of those cenotaphs?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Republicans have a right to pay tribute to, and
  commemorate, their dead like anyone else. There has been conflict over the
  past 30 years, but, as I said, the conflict has gone on much longer than that.
  That conflict, as with all wars, was bitter. There is no such thing as clean
  fighting in a war, despite what the Member opposite almost implied. We need
  only remember the rape and plunder committed by Cromwell in his early years in
  Ireland. <i>[Interruption].</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a reality. The Members opposite seem to have a
  difficulty in hearing the truth. However, it is the truth, and that is why it
  hurts. War is war. War was the same wherever it occurred.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Does Mr McHugh
  equate murder with war? Is he condoning the murders that have been committed
  over the years?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I consider that to be an intervention, not a point of
  order. The Member may wish to respond.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The British security forces, in collusion with Loyalists,
  murdered Nationalists on many occasions. Louis Leonard was murdered in his
  butcher’s shop in Derrylin in 1972. That involved collusion with the
  security forces. Michael Naan and Andrew Murray were killed in south Fermanagh
  as part of the pitchfork murders. They were killed by security forces — by
  soldiers in British regiments, who later admitted it.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were many other murders in that area. Patsy Kelly
  from Trillick is one example. There have been many accusations as to which
  element of the British security forces was responsible for that murder. No one
  has ever admitted to it. Those are only a few of the murders. Nationalists
  were murdered, but there seems to be no agreement —</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Member give way?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I need to use whatever time I have left, given that we have
  only eight minutes to speak.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have always been prepared to acknowledge that there has
  been hurt on both sides and that there is no monopoly on suffering and pain.
  Gerry Adams has consistently told Unionists that Sinn Féin, through the peace
  process, wants to move to a different position. This type of debate does not
  encourage that.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Observers can only be encouraged by Unionists’ asking in
  the Assembly for something completely different for Nationalists and
  Republicans who want to honour their dead. This is not for their
  glorification; this is done simply because they believe they have that right.
  I agree. Most Nationalists and Republicans quietly put up memorials as a mark
  of respect, a tribute to their dead, to volunteers who gave their lives for a
  struggle they believed to be right. They were right. They gave their lives for
  the right reasons, as did anyone who fought in the British wars. Those people
  believed that they fought for an honourable cause, and that should be
  recognised by all sides. Unionists especially should not beat the drum that
  they are the only ones who are right.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mayhem and slaughter are seen as the backdrop to history in
  any country in the world where Britain ruled. I am sure that most Unionists
  here know their history very well, but perhaps they pick and choose the parts
  to remember. Most Nationalists, however, know their history exactly. We have
  had 800 years of history here, and we do not need to be told it. The future
  position of Nationalists must be based on equality. Éamonn ONeill referred to
  picking and choosing someone to make a particular statement on a monument in
  his town. We cannot do that. For the conflict to cease, we must go forward on
  the basis that everyone has a right to honour his dead.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Boyd:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to place on record my opposition to the erection of
  illegal memorials by Republicans. Those so-called memorials are deliberately
  provocative. They are designed to mark out territory and further insult the
  innocent victims of IRA terrorism. In respect of the SDLP amendment, the
  distinction between innocent victims, both Protestant and Catholic, and those
  who set out to destroy lives and property must be clear. It is insulting and
  disgraceful that some in the Assembly and in the community refer to terrorists
  and their families as victims when they set out deliberately to plan and
  execute heinous acts of terrorism that resulted in innocent victims. It is
  disgraceful that Republicans in the Chamber treat with contempt those gallant
  Protestants and Catholics who fought side by side and died in wars, including
  the world wars.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a scandal that terrorist families have received
  Government support and funding, while many innocent victims, including those
  who laid down their lives in defence of freedom and democracy, have received
  no compensation and are not even permitted to honour their loved ones. Mrs
  Thelma Johnston’s son David was in the RUC. He was brutally murdered by the
  Provisional IRA on 16 June 1997 in Lurgan, shot in the back by cowardly scum
  while serving the whole community. A committee of Belfast City Council
  recently refused Mrs Johnston permission to lay a wreath on behalf of those
  brave members of the security forces who had laid down their lives. I hope
  that those gullible and disgraceful Presbyterians who yesterday embraced Alex
  Maskey of Sinn Féin/IRA meet the innocent victims of Republican terrorism.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout Northern Ireland, however, many illegal
  memorials are erected by Republican terrorists. It is a disgrace that many
  councils turn a blind eye to that and refuse to demolish or remove them. Many
  of those memorials are strategically placed to cause maximum hurt and pain.
  They are placed on main roads, close to where many members of the security
  forces and others were murdered and maimed. It is disgusting that some
  councils, such as Newry and Mourne District Council, maintain memorials to
  Republican terrorists.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is disgraceful that Londonderry city council claimed
  ignorance of the statue of an INLA terrorist armed with a rifle that was
  erected in a Londonderry cemetery. The INLA is responsible for some of the
  worst terrorist atrocities, including the Darkley massacre in south Armagh;
  the murder of 17 people in the Ballykelly bomb in County Londonderry; the
  murder of the Conservative Party’s Northern Ireland spokesman, Airey Neave
  MP; and the murders of many other innocent people. Many other Republican
  memorials have been erected illegally in Northern Ireland, causing heartache
  for many innocent victims.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My problem with the motion is that it calls for the
  Executive to take action. The Executive includes Sinn Féin’s Martin
  McGuinness, a self-confessed leader of the Provisional IRA. At a Republican
  memorial rally in Bodenstown on 23 June 1986, ‘The Irish News’ quotes the
  same Martin McGuinness — the so-called Minister of Education — as saying</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Freedom can only be gained at the point of an IRA
  rifle. I apologise to no one for saying that we support and admire the freedom
  fighters of the IRA.&quot;</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would, therefore, add to the hurt of the innocent
  victims to call on Martin McGuinness when he clearly endorses the Provisional
  IRA’s erection of illegal memorials to Republican terrorists.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The illegal memorials must be removed immediately, and
  ultimate responsibility for their removal should be placed firmly with the
  Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and the Northern Ireland Office. The Prime
  Minister is too quick to remove essential security installations, yet he
  refuses to remove the illegal memorials to Republican terrorists who were
  guilty of the most heinous crimes.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the worst reminders for the innocent victims of
  terrorism is IRA/Sinn Féin in the heart of the Government of Northern
  Ireland. I have spoken to many innocent victims, including some from the
  constituencies of the Members who proposed the motion. I call on the hon
  Members Foster and Kennedy to ease the pain of the innocents by removing the
  Ulster Unionist Party from the power-sharing Assembly with IRA/Sinn Féin. The
  placing of IRA/Sinn Féin in the heart of Government over the people whom they
  continue to terrorise compounds the hurt of the innocent victims of terrorism.
  The innocent victims continue to suffer.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion for two reasons: the memorials are
  offensive to the majority of decent people; and they are illegal because they
  were erected without planning permission. An illegal memorial has been erected
  in the village of Dungiven, three miles from where I live. It is supposedly in
  memory of the hunger strikers who took their own lives in the early 1980s, but
  it has caused much hurt to the family of an RUC officer who was shot dead
  within 50 yards of it and much distress to the parishioners of the local
  parish church, which is just yards from it. The church’s property has been
  damaged many times, and its hall has been burnt to the ground.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To add insult to injury, the eyesore has been erected on
  the only open space in Dungiven’s Main Street. It is across the road from
  Dungiven Castle, which was regenerated as a tourism centre using thousands of
  pounds of public money. There are those in the Unionist community who do not
  feel that they can visit that historic site because of the intimidating
  structure opposite.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People who have been deeply involved in terrorist activity
  in recent years but who now claim to be democrats have been elected to local
  councils throughout Northern Ireland. It should naturally follow that
  democrats should not only support and uphold the law of the land but should be
  seen to do so. However, it is clear that many who claim to be democrats are
  not. When I raised the issue of the illegal memorial at the council’s
  monthly planning meeting, the majority of the SDLP councillors did not support
  its removal and none of the Sinn Féin councillors was supportive, which was
  no great surprise.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that the Planning Service has not taken any steps
  to remove the memorial is disturbing. Hundreds of people who pay due regard to
  the process and follow the correct procedures are refused planning permission.
  Understandably, they find it difficult to understand why others can build
  whatever they like, wherever they feel. I urge the Planning Service to review
  its policy on illegal developments and remove these offensive so-called
  memorials forthwith.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can all recognise the sensitivities of people who have
  lost family members. However, with proper planning approval, there is enough
  space in cemeteries to erect appropriate memorials. It is incumbent on all
  elected representatives to ensure that these illegal structures are removed. I
  support the motion.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall address some technical points before I consider the
  more emotive issue of how to deal with this difficult subject.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be a good idea if the Executive were to consider
  the issue, because it will not go away. The Executive should consult the
  agencies that are cited in the amendment, and also local councils.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Depending on where memorials are erected, they are likely
  to cause offence. The Women’s Coalition is a cross-community party that is
  made up of Nationalists, Unionists and others. Since Jane Morrice and I were
  elected to the Assembly, we have tried to understand the perspectives of the
  opposing sides. We always question ourselves on whether our actions give due
  consideration to human rights. Are we being inclusive in what we say or do? We
  may get it wrong at times; if people are brought up in one community, they do
  not always understand what it is like for the other community. Do we provide
  equality of opportunity, or are we acting in a discriminatory way?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The test has been difficult, but the same test could be
  applied to how we remember the dead. The agreement states that there is a
  right to free political thought and a right to freedom and expression of
  religion. In this country political identity and religion are often mixed up.
  The agreement also refers to the right to freedom from sectarian harassment.
  Although we are debating memorials to the dead, and given the Minister for
  Employment and Learning’s earlier statement, I am concerned about the
  creation of murals that are dedicated to the living before they are dead.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall give you an example of how difficult it is for
  Departments to reconcile their responsibilities. If a memorial is built on
  public land, the Department that owns that land is responsible. Councils have
  had to deal with that problem. If a mural is painted on a wall, the owner of
  the property is responsible. Lamp-posts and street lights are the
  responsibility of the engineering and lighting division of the Department of
  the Environment, and pavements are the responsibility of the Roads Service of
  the Department of the Environment. I made many phone calls this afternoon, and
  it takes several hours —</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member referred to the Department of the Environment.
  Will she acknowledge that those responsibilities were transferred from the
  former Department of the Environment to the Department for Regional
  Development?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge that it is completely confusing, and I am
  glad of the intervention.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One area is the responsibility of the Department of the
  Environment, and another area is the responsibility of the Department for
  Regional Development. It is good that the Executive may have an opportunity to
  address the matter. The situation is absolutely ridiculous, the height of
  nonsense. The Planning Service says that if a memorial is erected without
  planning permission and is considered unacceptable, it must determine whether
  formal enforcement action is appropriate.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I may not vote for the amendment. I would like to know who
  would be responsible for the enforcement of any guidelines that may be
  adopted. The Planning Service does not apply much enforcement with regard to
  what is being erected, or where it is being erected. The same Planning Service
  then says that there are no permitted development rights for memorials or
  monuments in Northern Ireland, irrespective of size or classification —
  there is no legislation in place. That may be something for the Executive to
  address.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.45 pm</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Planning permission is required for the erection of any
  monument or memorial outside a cemetery. Inside cemetery walls is where they
  ought to be; if they are being erected anywhere else, they are offensive. It
  may be that local residents, depending on which community has the majority at
  a particular time, do not see them as offensive, but if we take the principle
  that we are dealing with a double minority, then the memorials will offend
  someone. The Executive should address the fact that legislation is not in
  place for memorials or monuments outside cemeteries.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened to the debate, and I am disheartened by
  what I have heard. Ours is a damaged society — the conflict has been a
  terrible one — but until people get out of denial that there has been
  terrible hurt and desperate murder committed and take responsibility for that
  and commit themselves to doing something different in the future, we will go
  round and round in a vicious circle.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have much sympathy for the Ulster Unionist motion — the
  issue needs to be addressed. Memorials are being erected all over the place,
  and those from the other side need to seriously consider what those memorials
  mean to people as they are passing by, particularly the relatives of those who
  have been murdered.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People who are writing sectarian scribbles on the walls of
  east Belfast should seriously consider how offensive and dangerous they are to
  people walking past them.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time to remember and to change. We are not ready to
  put up memorials around the country willy-nilly. The Executive should take the
  issue seriously — although no Minister is present to respond to the debate.
  When the Business Committee met last week it asked the Executive to decide
  which Minister would take responsibility. I see that they could not come to
  any agreement on that matter. Where does the issue go after we have debated it
  today?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. As I listened to Members’ comments
  I thought about canvassing in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, where we do not need
  memorials along the road. We can see the crossroads where someone was shot in
  the back; the tarmac patch where the bomb exploded and where several people
  were murdered. We cannot forget that.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Ms McWilliams that we have to look forward.
  Here we have an instance of coat-trailing by one side of the community trying
  to perpetuate the problem.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have so many insensitive IRA monuments erected in public
  places, causing great distress to the families of people murdered by those
  named on the monuments. It is claimed that those named on the monuments were
  on active service. The term &quot;active service&quot; implies a recognised
  army or battle situation — not the actions of a sordid terrorist
  organisation that ambushed and murdered unarmed civilians going about their
  day-to-day business. The weasel words of &quot;active service&quot; are used
  to try to cover the fact that IRA members were actively seeking innocent
  members of the public to murder. Thankfully, many people were saved from
  further outrages by the security forces.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Remembrance is an important part of our healing process. It
  ensures that those who went before us, and their contributions to society, are
  not forgotten. We have monuments to the dead of both world wars, and I
  emphasise that they commemorate people from both communities. I am a proud
  Enniskillen person, born and raised in the town. I recognise people from all
  parts of the community. During the world wars, it did not matter whether
  someone was a Roman Catholic or a Protestant. People were proud to serve in
  the two regiments, and their names are on war memorials. Please let it be
  recorded in Hansard that it was not a sordid campaign.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are memorials to the dead from both communities in
  both world wars. There are also monuments to tragedies, but our most common
  memorial is the headstone of the family grave. Those memorials are dignified
  and respectful, but to equate a traditional monument with that of an illegal
  terrorist organisation is repugnant and insulting to all ordinary people. The
  victims’ families have to pass such monuments on the roadside, and it brings
  back terrible memories each time. The pain endured by the families does not
  lessen with the passage of time. In Fermanagh and South Tyrone there are too
  many roadside IRA monuments.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned by Sinn Féin’s inflammatory actions and
  words. Its members involve themselves in public displays of contempt and
  hatred, which only further divide society. This is the same party that talks
  so much about equality and peace. A Sinn Féin Member from Fermanagh and South
  Tyrone stated in a BBC report that the positioning of a monument at a Belleek
  crossroads was justified. The same person admitted that those mentioned were
  on active duty. She also stated that the RUC and Royal Irish Regiment
  monuments were in public places.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monuments to the Army, the RUC and the Royal Irish Regiment
  are kept in churches, graveyards, security buildings or on Government
  property. The only truly public memorials are war memorials to commemorate —
  and I say it again — both Protestants and Roman Catholics who died in two
  world wars. They are poignant reminders to the public of the terrible price
  paid for fighting fascism for the common good. The IRA is simply an extension
  of the evil that plagued the world more than 60 years ago. Churches and
  graveyards are a testament to the price that we paid to ensure that madness
  did not destroy our freedom.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If terrorist groups wish to have memorials, they should
  consider asking whether they could place them in the graveyards and churches
  of their own denomination or allegiance, where they will not cause offence.
  They should consider that; there are already some in graveyards and burial
  grounds.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All plaques, memorials and monuments on public sites
  require planning permission. I call on all the Departments to co-ordinate
  their efforts to ensure that these illegal memorials, with their pseudo,
  copycat trappings of conventional war memorials, are removed from our
  roadsides, forestry plantations and historical graveyards.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. At times we have been guilty of
  missing the main point of this debate. I do not call these objects
  &quot;memorials&quot;. They are wayside platforms for the promotion of the
  political activists who have supported terror in this country. This is another
  part of the IRA/Sinn Féin terror campaign. It is a form of political and
  institutional terror and a way of dominating the landscape.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every one of these memorials, as they call them — I call
  them the political platforms for the activists turned political terrorists —
  are for the draft dodgers, the quartermasters, the suppliers, the finger
  pointers and all those who have been part of a unique campaign of genocide,
  particularly in the west of the Province. Let us not forget that the IRA
  strategists who control Sinn Féin have not changed their great ambition. They
  view this as part of their campaign to deliver a Republican, united Ireland.
  This is simply a stepping stone. We have seen how they have changed their
  tactics over the years.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was delighted that Gerry McHugh admitted in his speech
  that it was murder; that is the first time I have heard a member of his party
  admitting that what was carried out was murder. However, he went back to the
  old Republican phrasebook when stuck for a little ammunition and talked about
  800 years of British misrule. I will pose him some questions. Who murdered at
  the rate of 27 to one in the Irish civil war of 1921-22 — was it not the
  so-called Irish who killed the Irish? Will he tell the Assembly whether the 10
  who were exhumed by the Southern Government and re-interred recently in
  Glasnevin Cemetery were pro-treaty or anti- treaty? Had they survived their
  jail term, would they have been murdered by their own?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is interesting that Mr McHugh made one slip in all this,
  supporting the erection of terrorist platforms by the waysides so that almost
  weekly they could have another campaign to make sure that the Young Turks and
  the older troops would be ready, accessible and amenable. That is what they
  are about. Therefore I would never dignify the activities of the IRA and its
  campaigns of murder with memorials. My constituency has too many bitter
  remembrances of those occasions. I could mention Teebane and Ballygawley Road,
  one, two, and three — they are all multiple murders. Most people have
  forgotten Teebane. I could mention the Royal Arms Hotel murders, the
  Knocknamoe murders and, of course, the Omagh bomb murders.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was not just a terror campaign of genocide — it has
  moved on to domination. Believe it or not, I was surprised at the SDLP, which
  has again shown tremendous weakness. That party is always urging us to take
  leadership and move forward. However, Éamonn ONeill said that Sinn Féin
  treated equality with contempt; that theirs was a &quot;themselves alone&quot;
  programme. Having admitted that Sinn Féin is all about &quot;themselves
  alone&quot; and that Sinn Féin treated equality with contempt, that Mr ONeill
  lacks the courage or wisdom to support the motion displays a terrible weakness
  in SDLP thinking</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must be wise to the real issue. Terror comes in many
  forms, such as the physical form of murder; there have been 97 murders in my
  constituency. It can also come in institutional forms. It can come in the form
  of the stoning of school buses or of quiet, insolent contempt for everything
  that is Unionist.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What threat is a small Orange lodge of 22 members to a
  massive Republican community? The church is in Carrickmore. Twenty-two local
  farmers and labourers going to a Sunday service — what threat could that
  pose to the massive Republican stronghold of Carrickmore? It cannot be
  tolerated; that is what Sinn Féin means by equality. Similarly, Mountfield is
  a Republican stronghold; out of seven councillors, it produces four Sinn Féin
  members. What threat would a wee Orange lodge of 27 members be to that
  community? It cannot be tolerated.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My time has run out. I support the motion.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Murphy:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I want to make
  a few comments. I agree with Mr Gibson that the places he mentioned present no
  threat to anyone. It is an absolute disgrace that anyone would consider them
  as such. The difference is that I can say that an attack on an isolated Orange
  hall is absolutely and fundamentally wrong and goes against any Republican
  principle. I disagree with that entirely.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the same people will never speak out about
  Catholic churches in east Belfast or other isolated Catholic communities that
  have been under attack. They will somehow always fall back on the notion that
  such attacks are reactive, that they are a reaction from the community to some
  greater misdeed that was done to their community. That is the difference.
  Isolated communities on whatever side should be allowed to live in peace. Mr
  Gibson, who has since left, should consider some of the actions carried out by
  people from his community and treat them with the same seriousness.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion’s tone has set the standard for the debate,
  which has been largely predictable. It shows how far we must go if we are to
  engage in any reconciliation process. Sam Foster spoke about people not having
  any honesty, integrity or dignity. He reverted to that type of language when
  talking about us. That struck me because the same people who share Committees
  with us here and who support the d’Hondt principle — that we will take the
  rightful places that we are entitled to by the number of votes that we receive
  — will walk out of a council meeting because a Sinn Féin member is elected
  chairperson.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a lack of integrity in Unionist representatives
  when they can do business with Sinn Féin and support the elections of its
  members in Chambers such as this, yet huff and puff in other chambers and walk
  out when Sinn Féin is elected. When we talk about honesty and integrity, we
  must look at ourselves first and foremost.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the sentiments of the amendment. Monica
  McWilliams —</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Member speaks about integrity and otherwise at
  councils, is he referring to me?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Murphy:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I heard Mr Foster’s opening remarks on the monitor. If I
  heard correctly, he questioned the honesty and integrity of Republicans and
  Republican elected representatives. In this institution, his party and
  Unionists support the right of Republicans to the positions to which they are
  entitled, and they have voted in support of that and d’Hondt. However,
  recently in Belfast City Council, members of his party, including Ministers
  who benefit from the d’Hondt mechanism, walked out of a council meeting when
  Sinn Féin got its just entitlements as the largest party on that council.
  When talking about honesty and integrity, one should look to oneself first and
  foremost.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the sentiments of the amendment. It talks
  about &quot;agreed criteria&quot;, and that term is not defined. Monica
  McWilliams raised questions about the amendment. An agreed set of procedures
  for erecting monuments is something that we could go along with.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was some irony when Éamonn ONeill said that the
  behaviour of Sinn Féin in Downpatrick was hypocritical because it flew in the
  face of supporting the equality provisions. The irony is that the monument was
  erected to an unarmed person who had been shot dead by the RUC. He was left to
  bleed to death in the street, and that was a breach of his human rights.
  However, the MP for the area at the time said that he felt that the RUC had
  acted appropriately in the action it took, in allowing an unarmed man to bleed
  to death in the street. That is a challenge to its support of human rights,
  which it has lauded over the years.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Unionists who proposed the motion object to the
  erection of illegal monuments, and that is what the motion is focused on. On
  the one hand, I can see that that might be the case. A monument was erected in
  my village in 1991. Planning permission was sought, a lay-by was built and
  agreed by the Department of the Environment, and there were no objections from
  local Unionists.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, when Republicans in Newry sought the agreement of
  the council some months ago to find a site for the erection of a monument to
  commemorate the hunger strikers, Danny Kennedy lodged very vocal objections,
  even though the people involved had worked with the council to try to identify
  a site and had located the monument on a site that the council had suggested,
  not one that they themselves had chosen. That begs the question: are people
  really worried about whether monuments are legal or illegal or about the fact
  that there are monuments at all?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have said that the location of monuments is
  insensitive. Gerry McHugh made the point that there are monuments to those who
  fought in the British Army in every town centre. From the roof of Woolworths
  in Newry, less than 50 yards from the cenotaph, the British Army shot dead
  three young men in the early 1970s. No one, as far as I am aware, has objected
  to the location of the cenotaph in the middle of Newry or has tried to have it
  removed. It stays there and people are entitled to have their remembrance.
  However, it is a monument to those who served in an army that murdered people
  on the streets of that town. Newry is a largely Nationalist town, and no one
  has objected to the cenotaph.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a tradition that people are sensitive to how
  remembrance is conducted. The media are all obliged to wear poppies in
  November in remembrance of the British Army, regardless of their political,
  religious or personal affiliations. I ask the movers of the motion how they
  think Jean McBride, the mother of Peter McBride, feels when the people
  providing a service to her are obliged to wear poppies to commemorate the
  British Army that murdered her son and re-employed those who were found guilty
  of that murder.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are sensitivities on the other side to people they
  consider to be legitimate war heroes, as there are to people engaged in
  legitimate war on our side of the fence. All the sentiments expressed by Paul
  Berry could be expressed by someone from a Republican community about the RUC,
  the UDR or the British Army. They could all reflect the same sentiments of
  people murdering those who were trying to go about their business, who were
  innocent or who were not even involved in conflict. Murders have been covered
  up.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is talk of sensitivity and monuments being located in
  sensitive areas. There is hardly a town centre in the North that does not have
  a monument to those who have fought and served in the British Army.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Member give way?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Murphy:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have very little time, and I cannot give way. However, I
  will address a point made by Joan Carson. There are monuments at roadsides as
  well as cenotaphs in towns. There is one on the way to Kingsmills, not far
  from where Danny Kennedy comes from, and there is one in Castlewellan to UDR
  members who were killed there.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That does not stop the Unionists who talk about sensitivity
  from travelling round the South. There is hardly a road or town in the South
  where there is not a monument to someone from the IRA who was killed during
  the war of independence. Nationalists and Republicans erect monuments in a
  different way to Unionists, who erect cenotaphs in town centres.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have run out of time. We need to address a process of
  national reconciliation. Unionists seem to be fixated with the idea that they
  are right and that there is a necessity to prove that they are right. That
  means running down anything that Republicans try to do. That will not lead us
  to national reconciliation. I accept that we should be sensitive as to how we
  commemorate our dead. Unionists must learn that the commemoration of British
  Army war dead is a very sensitive topic for people on my side of the fence.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. I also want to look at the amendment
  proposed by Mr Tommy Gallagher. In it he talks about the need for criteria and
  referring the matter back to various bodies, including the Executive. It is
  important for Members to reflect that a criterion already exists; it is called
  the planning law. Any memorial requires planning permission, and the erection
  of a memorial without planning permission is illegal. Every one of the
  memorials that have gone up without planning permission is illegal. That is
  the law.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have served on the planning committee at Belfast city
  hall for many years. Many Members are similarly aware of planning law, because
  they deal with it on a daily basis in local councils. Development, as defined
  in article 11 of the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1991, is:</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the carrying out of building, engineering, mining or
  other operations in, on, over or under land, or the making of any material
  change in the use of any buildings or other land.&quot;</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Other operations&quot; is a catch-all term for any
  physical operation.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The memorials that we are debating are illegal because they
  do not have planning permission. The question then is what to do about them
  legally. Action can be taken by way of an enforcement notice against the
  person or organisation that erected the memorial and the landowner. That
  action is available to the Department of the Environment. Planning
  applications were not submitted for many of those memorials, and no one
  claimed ownership of them, which makes the enforcement process difficult.
  However, other action can be taken; the landowner has the right to clear his
  land of anything that people put on it.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The land on which many of those memorials have been erected
  belongs to Departments. The point has been well made in the debate that
  Departments have a duty to ensure that the law of the land and planning
  regulations are enforced. The issue is an emotive and a difficult one, but
  that does not excuse the breaking of the law by Mr Conor Murphy’s
  organisation in each and every one of those cases.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have spelt out the criteria. There is no need for the
  amendment. The matter may be difficult, emotive and sensitive, but those are
  the criteria, and the process of obtaining planning permission and permission
  from the landowner must be adhered to. That is the way forward.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the substance of the motion for reasons that have
  already been mentioned in the debate. Sam Foster and Mrs Carson referred to
  the memorial erected in Belleek to IRA volunteers who carried out acts of
  murder. It is not located where the IRA volunteers died, but it has been
  erected at the spot where they carried out that act of murder. Two men
  travelling in their car were singled out and murdered by the IRA. The IRA/
  Republicans put up a memorial on that spot.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not only were the IRA saying that those men had no right to
  exist, which is bad enough; they are now attempting to say that they never
  existed, which is monstrous. That is the reason I support the motion. That act
  is not simply insensitive, intolerant or inequitable; it is absolutely
  monstrous. They are looking to eradicate the existence of those men by
  erecting an IRA memorial on the spot where they died. That is disgraceful and
  outrageous.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The place for memorials is often in graveyards. That is
  recognised by the authorities, because planning permission to erect a memorial
  in a graveyard is not required. Permission is required from the owner, which,
  in many cases, is the local council. The Republican plot in Belfast is a case
  in point. Republicans have the opportunity to erect memorials to their dead in
  that plot, and it is an appropriate way for them to grieve for and to remember
  those friends and family members that they have lost.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Conor Murphy referred to war memorials in many towns in
  Northern Ireland. Those are memorials to the dead of two world wars — the
  two greatest wars in history, in which millions of people died, including many
  from both sides of the community in Northern Ireland and people from right
  across these islands.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those memorials are different from monuments to people who
  set out to achieve a political aim that they could not fulfil by democratic
  means. An overwhelming majority of the population rejected those political
  aims, so the terrorists resorted to terror in an effort to achieve them. They
  failed, and that is why Members are here today. The Assembly is trying to
  rebuild society and to deal with its pain and scars. That will not be done by
  erecting memorials on roadsides and at inappropriate spots that cause great
  hurt to the community. A graveyard is the proper place for a memorial.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If planning permission and the landlord’s permission to
  erect the memorial were obtained, nobody would object; however, that did not
  happen in the cases outlined. The erection of a memorial in Belleek was
  monstrous. The only course of action is to ensure that the landowner and the
  authorities take the necessary steps. The attitude of Republicans, including
  those in the Chamber, is a formula for conflict.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Republicans are denying Unionists the right to exist. That
  is evident in the blocking of roads; for example, Ormeau Road was blocked
  during an Orange march that consisted of only two or three dozen Orangemen.
  Those Orangemen’s culture, identity and right to exist are being denied.
  They are being told that they have no right to be there. Republicans have
  still not learnt that Unionists have a right not only to exist, but to be part
  of a democratic and free society.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no case for the amendment, which should be voted
  against. There is an overwhelming case for the motion.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.15 pm</p>
  </i><b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been extremely lively debates on the issue in
  council chambers across the Province. In the city of Londonderry in the early
  1970s, the IRA decided to kill company directors, including the head of DuPont,
  who was shot dead as he returned from work by gangsters who waited for him
  outside his house. I know of other company directors in Londonderry who were
  shot dead by the IRA. The IRA, during those years, felt that it was necessary
  to &quot;take out&quot; the directors of major companies throughout the
  Province. The IRA has also murdered young children, mothers, fathers, sons and
  daughters.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For decades, the Republican movement has carried out a
  terrorist campaign without shame. In the Foyle constituency the IRA shot dead
  a young policeman and returned a year later and shot dead his only daughter.
  This afternoon, Members have heard about people’s rights. The Republican
  movement in the House has tried to equate terrorists’ monuments to cenotaphs
  throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my city of Londonderry wreaths that were laid on
  Remembrance Sunday by many organisations have been torn apart and taken off
  the cenotaph two hours later on many occasions. We in Londonderry know all
  about Sinn Féin/IRA’s rights, as they call them.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to be clear about what the debate is about, and I
  know some Members equate those monuments to memorials in graveyards. A
  Republican movement took over a graveyard in Londonderry to erect a terrorist
  monument, and that movement stayed in the city cemetery for several days. Even
  today, many Protestants whose relations are buried there cannot go near it.
  The monument was so high that it was a total insult not only to the many
  Protestant people there but to many in the Nationalist community. I invite
  anyone in the House to look at that monument and ask himself whether this is
  about rights when he sees that monument towering above the other gravestones.
  A Republican organisation practically takes over a graveyard, threatens the
  people there and erects a monument, and Sinn Féin/IRA talks to us about
  rights.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In another instance in Londonderry it has taken over Roads
  Service land to erect other monuments, and, once again, it has used force. We
  can have all the planning laws we want, and the Executive can do whatever they
  want, but those people just take over areas in my city by force and erect
  monuments. Anyone who enquires about what is happening is threatened.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem in Northern Ireland — and it has been so for
  many years — is that terrorists are happy to threaten and murder people and
  break the law to erect monuments because they know that they have a weak
  British Government that will do nothing. There is a feeling among Republicans
  that they can do anything here, and if they want a monument on any piece of
  land, they will use whatever brutal force is necessary to ensure that it is
  erected.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. However, I do not know what will
  happen now, given that there is still an armed wing that is prepared to take
  over land to erect monuments. There is a serious issue of law and order in
  Northern Ireland.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hamilton:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I say at the outset that, having listened to Mr Conor
  Murphy, I know of no spectacle more offensive and ridiculous as the Republican
  movement in one of its periodic fits of pretentious morality. I support the
  motion so ably proposed by my Colleague Mr Foster. There is a difference
  between graveyard monuments and memorials in places where the individuals who
  are commemorated are buried and monuments in open, shared places of public
  concourse.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dublin, for example, has many sites associated with the
  1916 Easter Rising. However, the Republican memorial is at the Republican plot
  in Glasnevin Cemetery. The city is not littered from one end to the other with
  memorials. Memorials in public places should command broad public support. War
  memorials to the fallen of forces that represented the legally elected
  Government of the day are one thing. Custom and practice have meant that war
  memorials have always been sited in prominent public places — usually town
  centres.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monuments for the fallen of an insurgent terrorist force
  that is responsible for killing many ordinary, innocent citizens in a
  cold-blooded and premeditated way are offensive to most of the population. If
  such monuments must exist, they should be confined to the cemeteries and
  graveyards where those whom they commemorate are buried; they should have the
  appropriate consent of church authorities. Memorials should not be politically
  provocative and should not be sited in politically provocative places. It
  seems that Sinn Féin is hell-bent on deliberately seeking out sites that will
  be provocative and are designed to hurt. Such sites represent in-your-face
  Republicanism.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ordinary planning rules are inadequate to deal with what is
  essentially a political issue. A judgement on whether a monument is
  aesthetically acceptable or in some way damaging to local amenities is not
  enough. Those monuments, by their very nature, are political statements. One
  is almost tempted to suggest that a solution might be to have such memorials
  subject to a body like the Parades Commission, because they have the same
  politically charged nature as many of the parades that are deemed contentious
  by some people.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those wildcat memorials run deep against the healing
  process that Sinn Féin purports to espouse. They stir up hatreds, bitter
  memories, fears and feelings that we all hoped could be left behind. When
  considered alongside other evidence, such as Sinn Féin’s involvement in
  stirring up community strife in north and east Belfast, its involvement with
  the terrorists and drug dealers of FARC in Colombia, its active links with
  other international terrorist groupings — all of which is attested to by
  independent external bodies, not only Unionist political comment — all point
  to a real Sinn Féin agenda that is at complete variance with its professed
  aim of healing Northern Ireland’s society.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is an agenda for perpetuating strife. It is war by other
  means, and I support the motion.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As my Colleagues have intimated, we will be supporting the
  motion.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I find the amendment quite offensive. It is despicable that
  the SDLP should use this opportunity to try to cover again for Sinn Féin/IRA.
  It is also most regrettable that the Minister of the Environment is not here.
  Whether he has full or partial responsibility, he should be speaking in this
  debate, but this is not the first time that that Minister has held the House
  in contempt, and we know that.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am quite offended at the SDLP’s attempt to amend the
  motion. Its amendment states that everything after &quot;Assembly&quot; should
  be left out and the following inserted:</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;recognises the sensitivities involved on all sides in
  respect of the commemoration of those who have lost their lives in the
  conflict here,&quot;.</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If ever there were a misnomer, a misuse and abuse of a
  word, it is the use of the word &quot;conflict&quot;. That is highly offensive
  and insulting. In Northern Ireland, a bunch of hoods, thugs and corner boys
  became murderers, and that is now described as a &quot;conflict&quot; — it
  is anything but. It is highly offensive and insulting of the SDLP to say that
  this was a conflict. It was unmitigated terror, perpetrated by those who made
  every attempt to overthrow the legitimacy of the state. They have shown in the
  crudest, rudest and most fascistic manner their disrespect for everyone who
  does not agree with them.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it not time for the SDLP to come clean on these issues?
  Is it not time that the SDLP stopped giving cover to Sinn Féin/IRA? The time
  has come for that party to stand up and be counted and demonstrate in clear,
  unambiguous terms that there is clear water between it and Sinn Féin/IRA.</p>

  not known me long, but you can visit my council and see if I have been
  ambiguous in my condemnation of terrorism, from whatever quarter. I do not put
  any ifs, ands or buts into that, as some Members try to. I want no monuments

  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The brutal campaign of terrorism that has been waged over
  the past 30 years in Northern Ireland must not be glorified in the monuments
  that are being erected willy-nilly across the country.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They are intended to offend and insult, and that is what
  they do. They are intended to carry on the war by another means. As has been
  said, our graveyards are a poignant testimony to what has gone on here for the
  past 30 years. We do not have to walk far from the Chamber to find the first
  monument to terrorism. Step out through the Door of the Chamber and on the
  right-hand side are two memorial inscriptions dedicated to three innocent
  people who were done to death by Sinn Féin/IRA. Cross the Great Hall to the
  Senate, where there was a service recently, and there are memorial
  inscriptions to Senator Paddy Wilson of the SDLP and Senator Jack Barnhill
  from Strabane, both brutally done to death. It is right and fitting that their
  memories should be lasting. I appreciate and applaud the fact that there are
  memorials by which to remember those two gentlemen. I understand that there
  will soon be another inscription to remind us of what happened. I am not
  selective in my condemnation, nor as to who should be commemorated.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do we need to be reminded of the Shankill Road fish shop,
  Teebane, Kingsmills, La Mon, Enniskillen, Omagh, Glenanne, the
  Ballygawley-Omagh road, Ballykelly, Narrow Water or Darkley Pentecostal
  Church? Those are but a few of the atrocities that we have had to live with
  and to endure, not to mention the gunning down of many individuals who were
  going to or coming from work, were at their place of work or were working on
  their farms.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin/IRA claims to represent working-class people. I
  am working class. I am neither proud nor ashamed of that. The vast majority of
  people who were gunned down were working class, trying to earn a living from a
  hard day’s work. Yet those people were seen as legitimate targets and were
  done to death. Some of them could not afford to buy a car and, as they cycled
  to work to earn a living in order to bring up their families, the people on
  the opposite Benches, who are associated with SinnFéin/IRA, gunned them to
  death. Yet these are the very people we are told must be remembered.</p>

  could go on and on, but my time is up. I support the motion.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to deal with a comment from the member for West
  Tyrone, Oliver Gibson, who referred to a weakness in the SDLP in tabling an
  amendment. An amendment that recognises that there are sensitivities on both
  sides of the community is not a sign of weakness. On the contrary, it is a
  sign both of leadership and a readiness to take up the challenge of dealing
  with difficult issues. In relation —</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Member give way?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not give way. If Maurice Morrow takes offence from
  an amendment that recognises that there is hurt and grief on all sides, such
  comments from an elected representative are an indication that some people in
  this society have a very long way to travel.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment deals with the problem of memorials and
  monuments in a logical and sensible way. The motion will not.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposer of the motion and the Minister of Culture,
  Arts and Leisure referred to the required planning permission for the
  monuments. Monuments have been erected regardless of planning permission, and,
  if this motion were passed and the monuments taken down, experience tells us
  that they would be erected again. Therefore, the amendment, not the motion,
  will address the problem. If the amendment is passed, it will ensure that the
  Executive, following consultation, will implement fair and workable
  guidelines.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is four years since the Good Friday Agreement, and in
  that period many people throughout the island, especially in the North of
  Ireland, have experienced real improvements in their lives. That, however, has
  not been the case for everyone. There are many bereaved families on both
  sides, and they must endure daily the pain and loss of a loved one. For them,
  the relative peace brought by the Good Friday Agreement does not assuage the
  pain of their loss. Instead, it has brought a heightened awareness and a deep
  sense of the futility of a conflict that robbed so many of life. For some
  bereaved families, it is essential to remember the past and to have
  commemoration rituals.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment recognises each side’s need to remember its
  dead and to commemorate the past. As Members know, a problem arises if
  monuments are erected in a manner or at a location that offends or hurts
  others. That is why the erection of the monument to dead IRA men in Belleek,
  where I live, has become so controversial. The IRA men whom it commemorates
  were killed many miles from Belleek, but the monument is on the very spot
  where that organisation murdered two Protestant workmen. The memorial has
  caused hurt to the families of those workmen and has met with strong
  disapproval in the local community. For the benefit of those Members who might
  support the motion, representatives of one of those Protestant families, the
  Hassard family, have said publicly that they have no problem with Republicans’
  commemorating their dead. However, they are hurt by the insensitive way in
  which the Republicans erected the monument.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has many memorials and monuments, some of
  which were mentioned, and some of which are controversial. Controversy is
  inevitable when a divided and hurt community bitterly remembers its dead. It
  will take time for those memories to fade. It has taken time in every other
  country that has experienced a conflict such as ours. In the Republic of
  Ireland, it took 70 years before the civil war could be remembered with a
  national day of commemoration. No healing can take place while memorials are
  hijacked for political purposes and there is a complete lack of understanding
  of the pain and hurt experienced in the other community. With the amendment,
  we can find a way to undo the damage that has been caused by the erection of
  some memorials and the way in which the issue has been handled.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague from Fermanagh and South Tyrone and Conor
  Murphy asked about the criteria. The criteria have not been drawn up.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we know from the consultation outlined in the
  amendment that criteria will be included that are based on fairness and
  equality. Ms McWilliams raised the genuine point about who will enforce the
  criteria, and we need answers to that. I have no doubt that when the Executive
  are given time to complete their consultations, they will give us answers.
  However, they must first be allowed to begin those consultations, and the only
  way in which that they can do that is if we pass the amendment. I ask Members
  to support the amendment.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker, I apologise to you for my non-attendance
  at the beginning of this important debate. I also apologise to Members and to
  those who participated earlier. I would also like to record an apology to my
  co-sponsor, Mr Foster, and thank him for his contribution. Unfortunately other
  business prevented me from attending, but I am grateful that there have been
  several contributions. I particularly want to thank those who agreed with the
  motion.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recent months and years we have witnessed a determined
  campaign by Republicans to create memorials in the Northern Ireland landscape
  that offend decent, law-abiding and God-fearing people. The memorials are
  placed deliberately and provocatively close to commercial centres and places
  where people are known to gather. They honour individuals who may at best be
  described as highly dubious, but more accurately as bloodthirsty murderers.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The groups that erect the memorials do not care about the
  real emotions of the relatives and friends of those who lost their lives to
  the so-called Irish patriots whom the statues honour. It often seems that
  determined efforts are made to maximise the victims’ hurt by placing the
  memorials close to the scenes of the atrocities that those so-called heroes
  carried out, and we heard evidence of that earlier in the debate.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who erect such memorials should be condemned,
  deplored and exposed as sectarian coat-trailers of the worst kind. I draw a
  distinction, and right-minded people draw the same distinction, between those
  whose names are honoured on war memorials and other such tablets in
  recognition of their service to their country. They carried out their duty as
  members of the security forces or the emergency services against those who
  chose to wage war in darkness and to kill without mercy or pity for victims
  who were given little or no chance.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Memorials are being erected to Republicans in places that
  bear no relevance to the events that occurred. Recently in Newry, a new
  memorial dedicated to the IRA hunger strikers was unveiled in a public park.
  The park is owned and maintained by the local authority. Members of a
  well-respected local Protestant business family provided the park in good
  faith to acknowledge their contribution to their community. The imposing
  nature of the monument is one thing, but it is worth remembering that none of
  the 10 hunger strikers came from Newry.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why should the memorial be erected there, close as it is to
  a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet and adjacent to the major shopping centre in
  Newry? There can be only one reason — to offend and intimidate.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other possible reason is that the erection of the
  memorial is proof that the unjustifiable Republican war is now over and that,
  to convince the grass roots that the partitionist settlement agreed to in the
  Belfast Agreement by Sinn Féin is worth having, with Stormont and Sinn Féin
  Ministers of the Crown administering British rule in this part of the UK, a
  few token monuments should be erected to keep the hardliners happy. How
  cynical can you get?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever the truth of the matter, these monuments have no
  place in any decent society that wishes to move on from the conflict and war
  that nearly destroyed it over 30 years. Whether the monuments are erected in
  Newry, Castlewellan, County Down, County Fermanagh or anywhere else, they are
  unacceptable.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue is cross-cutting in terms of ministerial
  responsibility. In addition to the planning and environmental issues put to
  the Minister of the Environment, I am aware of memorials on land and property
  owned by the Department for Regional Development and the Department of
  Agriculture and Rural Development. Examples are the memorial on land adjacent
  to the Newry bypass, which is presumably owned by the DRD, and the new and
  impressive defence wall built by the Rivers Agency of DARD at Kilmorey Street,
  Newry, which contains a memorial tablet to IRA volunteers. I hope that the
  Ministers responsible will, on receipt of the Hansard report of this debate,
  take action to remove offensive objects from their Departments’ property.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was gratified by Monica McWilliams’s acknowledgement
  that Unionists had every right to be offended by these memorials. I am
  grateful for the support of my Colleagues Joan Carson and Tom Hamilton and
  other Members of the House such as Paul Berry, William Hay and Oliver Gibson.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Conor Murphy seemed to think that Unionists were being
  inconsistent by objecting to the election of Alec Maskey as Lord Mayor of
  Belfast. The context in which Belfast City Council operates has to be
  remembered. The place was almost flattened by the activities of Sinn Féin/IRA
  during the troubles. Witnessing the activities of Sinn Féin/IRA
  representatives fostering, and continuing to agitate, civil disturbance in
  parts of Belfast, it is no wonder that Unionist members of Belfast City
  Council considered a representative of Sinn Féin to be unfit for the high
  public office of Lord Mayor.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Sinn Féin that there is no correlation between
  world war conflicts, commemorated by memorial tablets and monuments which
  properly indicate service and sacrifice in a worldwide conflict, and the
  actions of terrorist guerrilla warfare, which can never be considered as war
  in the true sense.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members mentioned the roadside memorials at
  Kingsmills and Teebane. Those are memorials to innocent workers and victims
  who were mercilessly murdered and who therefore have the right to be
  remembered.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reject the SDLP’s amendment. Once again, the SDLP is
  trying to cover for Sinn Féin on this issue, which is regrettable. Mr
  Gallagher asked that guidelines be provided. The best guidelines would be
  provided by the Planning Service and the Departments, whose Ministers should
  not allow the erection of such monuments on Government property.</p>
