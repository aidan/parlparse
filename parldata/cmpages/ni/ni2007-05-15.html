		    <p class="H2DocumentDate">Tuesday 15 May 2007</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr  Molloy] in the Chair).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading">Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Review of New Rating System</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for this debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to  propose and 10 minutes for the winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to  speak will have five minutes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Two amendments have been received and published on the  Marshalled List. The proposer of each amendment will have 10 minutes in which  to do so and five minutes for the winding-up speech.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the introduction of unfair changes  to the rating system, and calls upon the Department of Finance and Personnel to  conduct a full review of the new system, including in particular, consideration  of further income-related reliefs and a full income-based system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate you on your appointment, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Since the recent rates revaluation, I have been approached  by a number of my constituents whose rates have increased dramatically, in some  cases by more than &pound;1,000. For some, their rates would have doubled had it not  been for transitional rate relief. Most of those constituents live in an old  family home and exist on a modest pension. The rates increase will cause  extreme hardship in most cases, and in extreme cases it will result in people  having to sell the family home. It is unacceptable that elderly people who have  worked all their lives and have saved for their retirement are now being  hammered by those excessive rate demands.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive must revisit the options for funding local  government services. The present system, which is based on the regional rate, increasingly  puts the burden on the elderly and those on a fixed income. It also hits  low-income families. That cannot be acceptable in a civilised society. Rates  are a regressive tax, and they bear little relation to a person&rsquo;s ability to  pay. They not only create hardship for those on fixed incomes but have a  disproportionate impact on the low-paid. The Department of Finance and  Personnel&rsquo;s own figures, which are based on the 1999-2000 household survey,  show that a house with a weekly income of &pound;100 would pay 11&middot;6% of that in  rates, yet one with a weekly income of more than &pound;400 would pay only 2&middot;5% of  that figure.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The new valuations, which are based on capital values, that  were introduced in April 2007 highlight the rating system&rsquo;s unfairness. Any  system, however, that is based on property values is inherently unfair, as it  totally disregards a person&rsquo;s ability to pay. The problems raised by that  revaluation are not new, but they are fundamental to any system that is based  on property values.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For years, I have highlighted the plight of many elderly  constituents who live on small pensions and who must pay more than 10% of their  income on rates. <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">The current proposals have  emphasised and exacerbated</span> their hardship. It is time for something to  be done to reduce their burden.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Rates are a regressive tax, and they bear no relationship  to one&rsquo;s ability to pay. How can one justify an old-age pensioner&rsquo;s having to  pay the same as a family of three wage earners, simply because they live in a  similar house? Moreover, payment of rates does not relate to the use of  facilities. Can it be argued that a pensioner makes more use of an ice rink or  squash courts, creates more rubbish, or uses more water than a family of four?  Is it right that a person who lives on a pension should pay full rates while a  young person who earns a substantial wage and lives in the family home should  contribute nothing to the cost of local services?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Rates should be replaced by a tax that is based on ability  to pay. The recent change from a rates system that is based on rental values to  one that is based on capital values is merely tinkering with an unacceptable  system that needs fundamental reform.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have long argued that rates are inherently unfair because  they take no account of ability to pay. In 1982, I raised that issue with the  then Secretary of State, Jim Prior, when we met him to propose the abolition of  the regional rate. The problem has worsened significantly in recent years as successive  Finance Ministers &mdash; both Executive and direct rule &mdash; have raised the regional  rate disproportionately to pay for the upgrading of our economic  infrastructure. Few people would dispute that we must raise additional revenue  to upgrade that infrastructure, but that should not be done through an unfair  rating system that places the burden heavily on the most vulnerable sections of  our community. I therefore call on the Minister to carry out a full review of  the means of funding local services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that, in 2000, the Executive set up a review of  rating policy and began an extensive consultation process. However, the terms  of reference for that review were extremely restrictive and the consultation  was unable to consider options other than those that were based on property  values. My submission, which proposed a local income tax, was dismissed as  going beyond the terms of reference.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Much has happened since then. The regional rate has almost  doubled, and both the Lyons Inquiry and the Burt Review of local government, in  England and Scotland  respectively, have suggested changes to local government finance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There were more than 100 responses to the consultation in Northern Ireland,  but the input from some political parties was limited by the terms of reference  and, in other cases, was non-existent. I was the only elected representative to  oppose the principle of the charges and to call for the replacement of rates by  a tax that is based on ability to pay, such as a local income tax.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Three of the political parties that were then represented  in the Assembly did not submit any evidence, and the comments of the other four  queried the details of the new system, rather than the principles behind it,  which are fundamental to the achievement of a just system. Over the five-year  consultation period, there was very little interest from most politicians until  last year, when the new valuations were announced. Politicians then demanded  that the proposals be withdrawn.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for a review of all the options, particularly  income-based alternatives such as a local income tax. That would clearly be  fair, as it would be based on one&rsquo;s ability to pay; it would tax  non-householders who do not pay at present, and it would not act as a  disincentive to improve property. Other options include a local sales tax; a  services tax; green taxes, which would help the environment as well as raising  revenue, based on the principle that the polluter pays; and a land-value tax.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Green Party in the Scottish Parliament has proposed a  land-value tax, which is being considered by the Scottish Parliament and  Executive. The Assembly should examine that option, because such a tax would  benefit people on low income and would encourage the development of derelict  land. When land is derelict, no one pays tax on it, and no income comes from  it. A land-value tax would stop speculators from building up land banks on  which they pay no tax, but from which they benefit from almost daily rises in  land prices. Many developers, particularly in the greater Belfast area, have land banks where  affordable homes could be built.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The values of those land banks have increased dramatically  in recent years. It is wrong that developers rather than the public should  benefit from the appreciation in land prices. We should examine all those  options, and the Assembly should seek to acquire tax-raising powers so that all  increases in public expenditure are not met solely from the property tax paid  by the ratepayer but from a basket of taxes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that such a review will take time; however, a  great injustice could be resolved immediately. We should end the discrimination  against single householders in Northern    Ireland. Since 1993, single householders in  the rest of the UK  have benefited from a 25% rebate. That takes into account the fact that they  make less use of public services than larger households. That rebate has helped  millions of householders in Great    Britain, the majority of whom are  pensioners.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In 1992, I wrote to the then Finance Minister, Michael  Mates, to ask that he introduce a similar discount in Northern Ireland.  He rejected my request, pointing out that local-government finance is different  in Northern Ireland.  I wrote to all subsequent Finance Ministers and have a file of their replies,  which were pretty awful. Those Ministers did not understand the issue &mdash; for  example, Paul Murphy pointed out that the Exchequer funding for Northern Ireland is much higher than in the rest  of the UK.  Mark Durkan replied that the issue would be considered in the course of the  review of rating policy. The matter has been put off, year after year, since  1992. Why should Mrs Jones from Bangor in north Wales get a 25% discount, while Mrs Jones from Bangor in County   Down does not? Such  discrimination cannot be justified, particularly as the regional-rate burden  has increased significantly in recent years. In North Down alone, 5,600 single  pensioners would benefit from such a rebate. We call on the Minister of Finance  and Personnel to introduce the 25% rates discount for the single householder  and to end this discrimination.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I ask the Minister to set up a review of the  funding of local services and to consider moving from a property-based tax to a  mainly income-based tax. That review should also examine all other options,  such as a local sales tax, service tax, land-value tax and green taxes. If  necessary, the legislation must be changed to give the Assembly tax-raising  powers, which it should have anyway. It is essential that the burden of  taxation be spread more evenly and does not continue to fall most heavily on  the elderly and those on fixed incomes. In the meantime, I ask the Minister to  introduce the 25% discount available in the rest of the UK, thereby reducing the hardship and concern  experienced by tens of thousands of pensioners in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  beg to move amendment No 1: Leave out all after &ldquo;notes&rdquo; and insert</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;the widespread public concern at the changes to the rating  system and calls upon the Department of Finance and Personnel to conduct a full  review of the new rating system, including consideration of a generous,  non-means tested, rates relief scheme for pensioner households.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I tabled the amendment in the interests of avoiding the  complex, highly expensive and bureaucratic system that would emerge. For  &ldquo;income-related reliefs&rdquo; in the text of the motion, we should read  &ldquo;means-tested reliefs&rdquo;. With regard to take-up of means-tested relief, a 2006  report from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) indicated that benefit  take-up was in the range of 62% to 68% by caseload and 65% to 71% by  expenditure for 2004-05. In other words, a third of people entitled to those  reliefs did not claim them, so any such scheme will miss one third of the most  vulnerable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Pensioners&rsquo; groups have also examined the issue. Help the  Aged found, similarly, that 37% of pensioners did not take up their benefit  entitlement. We should not be surprised at that figure.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In a 2006 policy statement, Help the Aged indicated that  means testing much of this help has created a complex and bureaucratic system,  resulting in the failure of millions of the poorest pensioners to benefit from  the changes. Pensioner interest groups have expressed concern; therefore, my  amendment includes the words &ldquo;non-means tested&rdquo;. Any form of relief should be  universal; everyone should be free to apply for it or to receive it  automatically.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Help the Aged commented that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Universal benefits tend to have the best rates of  take-up as they are simple to understand, usually have clear eligibility  criteria, and are not associated with any kind of stigma.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many elderly people do not take up their entitlement  because they believe that they must reveal all of their personal circumstances.  It is an invasive process, and it is important that we realise that. Stigma,  therefore, is a big issue to consider when determining how any new system  should operate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion mentioned income-based systems. That means  income tax, and I am pleased that the proposer of the motion mentioned that in  his speech. However, he did not mention it in the motion itself, because he  wants additional income tax for Northern    Ireland. Will that help the economy or  detract from it? We must encourage as many people as possible to return to  employment and assist them to contribute to the economy. The fear that an  increase in income tax effectively means an additional tax, a poll tax, for  working families contributes to the problems.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a choice. There can be a full income tax system  for everything; for example, what was raised by property rates could be raised  by income tax. However, that would remove any choice from local government.  Each area would simply be handed a budget with central control over what could  be done with it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is a complex system to administer. We must remember  that, apart from income tax and the Inland Revenue, there may be issues  concerning national insurance, child tax credit, pensioner tax credit and  working families tax credit. How would all of those things work together in a  system? There is no doubt that any effect on someone&rsquo;s income will impinge on  other benefits. It is therefore foolish to introduce an income tax unless it is  introduced in the whole of the UK.  Instead of a huge administrative burden, it could be done more efficiently and  should be considered only at a national level.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To follow that route in replacing the rates system would  create a complex system. I surmise that the 250 staff employed by Crystal  Alliance to administer water charges is only a small number compared to the  number of civil servants required to administer any new income tax system that  is not fully integrated into the Inland Revenue. It is likely that we would  have to pay many civil servants to run yet another bureaucratic system, thereby  damaging the economy and without reaching the people we want to reach.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the motion referred to another choice  involving an income tax-based system, and that is to raise the regional rate  element from income tax and the remainder from property tax. Two systems would,  therefore, have to be administered. Money that we want to spend on services in  the community would be wasted.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those new Members who have yet to come into contact with  issues involving the complex system will, I fear, do so before long. I refer in  particular to the tax credit system. Some of the poorest families tried to take  advantage of benefits to which they believed they were entitled, only to  discover that, following an assessment by the Inland Revenue at the year end,  and owing to administrative errors and miscommunication, they had to pay back  several thousands of pounds.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That exacerbates the situation. Therefore a move towards  income tax would be done at our peril; it will be worthy of our consideration  only when it is co-ordinated at the national, UK level.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that any new rates system should be  universal so that everyone who is entitled to benefit from it will take it up.  In particular, vulnerable pensioners should be able to make use of it without  stigma. Incentives and entitlements should remain in such a system so that  everyone can save and be prudent as they prepare for their later years. It is  important not to create unreasonable administrative burdens.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member who moved the motion talked about other taxes  that he wishes to employ. Let us be careful with our economy; we should avoid  administrative burdens, complex systems and layers of tax that create  difficulties for small businesses and discourage people from becoming workers  or employers. We must allow the economy to grow. I am aware that the current  system must be reviewed for fairness and so that it can deal with additional  reliefs, but that must be done carefully. I suggest that the grief that Members  get currently from constituents about property tax is minimal compared to the  complaints that we would receive if we were to consider introducing further  income tax burdens on the working community. Remember that for &ldquo;income tax&rdquo;, I  read &ldquo;working family <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">taxes&rdquo;. Let us  encourage everyone back into employment</span> and to save, and let us be  cautious as we administer tax burdens on our community.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  beg to move amendment No 2: Leave out all after the second &ldquo;system&rdquo; and insert</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;which fundamentally fails the essential test of ability to  pay; and further calls for this review to give particular consideration to fair  and transparent income-based protections, and suitable reliefs for pensioners  and all disabled persons.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP supports the need for a review of the new rates  system. This amendment is necessary to emphasise that the central task that  faces the Minister of Finance and Personnel is the understanding that the  current system significantly generates rate demands that are not in line with  ability to pay.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A property tax creates basic tensions about ability to pay.  Houses do not pay the rates; occupants pay. Houses do not have incomes;  occupants do. Houses do not have outgoings  and varied circumstances; occupants do. Therefore the Minister faces  quite a task in creating a property tax that  truly reflects ability to pay. However, that should not be regarded as  an argument for a local income tax; it is not that simple.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me be clear that the SDLP is not calling into review &mdash;  and I doubt that any other party will, either &mdash; the central change in the new  system, which was the replacement of a rental-based valuation of property by a  capital-based one. All the evidence is that the old, rental-based approach was  regressive and placed a disproportionate burden on those with lower incomes. A  property tax is better based on capital, rather than rental, values.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is proper that those who are in the political system  recognise good administration, so, in passing, let me pay tribute to the staff  in the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) and the Rate Collection Agency  (RCA) who administered a complex changeover. Taken as a whole, they did it  well.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A capital-based system, however, brings its own problems.  There may be some broad correlation between the value of a house and the  ability of the occupant to pay. However, there are many exceptions and  anomalies that the Minister must address.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP wants income-based protection proposals for both  water charges and rates, to include a guaranteed maximum payment as a  percentage of a person&rsquo;s income.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are particular problems for pensioners. In <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">some cases they have valuable homes but low  incomes</span>. That happens frequently after people have been widowed. There  are places along the north coast, for example, where even modest homes have  been priced astronomically for some time. Pensioners who live in such  situations are carrying an unfair burden and need relief. The Government&rsquo;s  well-established concept of a minimum income guarantee under the social  security system is significant in this debate. Failure to allow proper relief  for pensioners under the present rating system undermines and contradicts that  guarantee.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If Draft Planning Policy Statement 14 is not removed, many  people will fear the next property revaluation exercise. Small cottages on  rural sites are now worth fortunes, and would be rated accordingly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP amendment mentions &ldquo;disabled persons&rdquo;. There is  25% rates relief for disabled people whose property has been modified; the SDLP  wants that relief to be extended to every person with a disability. Why should  a person with mobility difficulties who lives in a bungalow that does not need  modification be treated differently from other people with disabilities?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP proposes that there should be a revenue regulator  &mdash; an independent watchdog for all Government revenue proposals. The regulator  would assess, comment on and have powers to regulate such proposals, including  their cumulative effect. My party commends that proposal to other parties for  consideration.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There must be more transparency in the rating system.  Members have seen the people&rsquo;s anger during the argument over the water element  in the regional rate. People want to know what they are paying for.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the SDLP has no objection to a local income tax being studied, but there are many problems  involved. The Assembly has no tax-raising powers; the Scottish  Parliament has such powers but has never used them, and there must be good  reasons for that. HM Revenue and Customs would have difficulty in building in  such a scheme. If it were achieved, revenue would be collected across Northern Ireland  uniformly, but local council revenue demands vary enormously, so there is no  simple answer. There will be a property-based charge in Northern Ireland  for the foreseeable future. The current system contains significant defects,  which the Minister must rectify.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Congratulations on your  appointment, Mr Deputy Speaker. I missed the opportunity to congratulate you  yesterday.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion, and I have no difficulties with the  amendments, which extrapolate the issues that would have to be considered during  a review. Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s preferred option is the removal of the rates and their  replacement with a system of progressive direct taxation. However, that is work  in progress, and a considerable amount of work needs to be done. Sinn F&eacute;in  intends to pursue the matter with the Exchequer.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in believes that equality and ability to pay must be  at the heart of any rating system, and that such a system must be transparent  and fair. There should be a clear relationship between rates revenue, value for  money and the quality of services provided.  Mr O&rsquo;Loan referred to a prime example, which is the widespread public  view that people are being asked to pay twice for the same service when it  comes to water charges.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Consequently, Sinn F&eacute;in believes that the rating system in  the Six Counties is in urgent need of a radical overhaul, in the context of a  review of the Barnett formula, and the negotiations, which we hope will be  concluded successfully, on a meaningful peace dividend.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I call on the other parties in the Assembly to consider and  support Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s call for tax-varying powers for the Assembly. That would be  a key element in bringing forward policies and measures that reflect local  issues, expertise and accountability.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The current rating system, which was introduced by a direct  rule Minister, does not distribute the rates burden fairly and has achieved  little or no buy-in from stakeholders in our community. Every party addressed  the issue in the recent election. In particular, current rating policy does not  address the fact that, in many cases, house values bear no relationship to  income. Therefore, many people are in the unenviable position of being asset  rich but income poor and are experiencing exceptional hardship because of this  unfair system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the absence of a progressive tax-gathering power to  replace the present system, Sinn F&eacute;in argues that rates should be assessed  through an income-related system, which is based on the ability to pay, and  with specific exemptions for economically vulnerable groups such as older  people, those with disabilities and other low-income households. Sinn F&eacute;in  continues to raise public finance issues including tax-varying powers, the  Barnett formula, and the legacy costs of many years of neglect and  underinvestment by successive direct rule Ministers. Sinn F&eacute;in is raising those issues to give the new team of Executive  Ministers the tools and the opportunity to deliver on an agreed  Programme for Government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is incumbent on MLAs, parties and party groupings to  continue to provide support for that call and to continue to address those  issues with the British and the Irish Governments. Sinn F&eacute;in supports the  motion and the amendments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  DUP has been consistent in its concerns about the proposed system. The party  has highlighted its concerns from the start, and has raised them consistently  with Ministers. Taking the capital value of houses on 1 January 2005 is not a  reliable basis for determining rates. Therefore today&rsquo;s debate is welcomed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">People who fall just outside the benefits system and whose  net income does not reflect their level of wealth will suffer most as a result of the review of rating policy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP has pressed on a number of issues and it will  continue to press for a financial package to alleviate the situation. Unlike  other parties in the House, the DUP has not thrown in the towel on that issue.  At St Andrews, the DUP stressed that any system that left Northern Ireland  ratepayers without a cap on rates was inherently unfair. It was unacceptable to  have a situation in which people in Northern Ireland were, potentially,  paying a lot more than the Duke of Westminster. I am glad to say that the DUP  achieved a cap on rates. However, the level of the rates cap is too high, and  that needs to be taken into account in any review of rating policy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There should be a greater focus on the need for more  generous relief for pensioners, and I welcome references to that matter in both  amendments. Pensioners are the most vulnerable group who may be suffering  because of changes to the rating system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A fundamental mistake was made during the reinvestment and  reform initiative (RRI), when rates rises were linked to council tax in England and Wales. The result was that many of  us who served in local government saw a massive increase of 19% in the regional  rate, which meant that no matter how prudent local councils were, ratepayers  were given an unacceptable burden. The DUP believes that the link between  council tax levels in Great Britain  and Northern Ireland  should be broken.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP is content with both amendments as they focus on  the key issues; rates relief, and the protection of vulnerable groups. The DUP  will support the amendments because they improve the motion. Having listened to  the proposer of the motion, I have a number of concerns with the issues he has  raised. His solutions seem to be twofold &mdash; first, he proposes some kind of  agrarian revolution in this country in which landowners are taxed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The landowners will not pick up the bill for that: when  land is used for development it will simply become  an additional tax passed on to property owners. We do not need further  inflation of house prices in this country.  However, the United Community group &mdash; and  the Alliance Party, for whom I assume the proposer speaks also &mdash; has  become the party that believes in taxation to the hilt, because that is what  has been proposed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The other imaginative solution put forward by the group is  that of a local income tax. Again, the effect of that would be to tax people to  the hilt. When we are given an opportunity to vary income tax, the Treasury  will inevitably look at our expenditure &mdash; whatever the block grant is in  Northern Ireland &mdash; and advise that if we are looking for more money we should  simply increase our taxation to the maximum level possible before they can  consider any additional finance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The flawed thinking offered by Mr Wilson and others would  not soak the rich, but rather drown the working man and women in a tidal wave  of extra taxation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP welcomes the opportunity to debate the subject and  believes that there must be a fundamental review and examination of the rating  system. However, a review must focus on what will benefit people and must not  be counterproductive to the people and the economy of Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Members would do well to ask why this debate is necessary. It is because of the  failed political arrangements of the past, under both direct rule and the  failed arrangements of the Belfast Agreement. However, we are in a new dispensation,  and that dispensation has placed on us a responsibility to ensure that we get  it right &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  The Belfast Agreement mark II.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: &mdash;  unlike the hon Members who are now reduced to a small number in the corner of  the House, who cannot bring forward any proposals that command respect in the  community, and whose election results were a clear indication of that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are few recently elected Members who have not come to  realise the importance of the rating system in Northern Ireland. They will also  have realised how important it is for the Assembly to take real action to  ensure that the current situation imposed by direct rule <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">administrators is reviewed and a new system  implemented</span> that does not unfairly penalise Northern Ireland homeowners. In  that I include homeowners on Rathlin   Island, the most remote  part of my constituency, some of whom I am delighted to welcome as guests in  the visitors Gallery this morning.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP laid out its position clearly on the rating issue  in the run-up to the election, and it does not believe that the capital value  of someone&rsquo;s home on 1 January 2005 is a sufficiently reliable indicator of a  person&rsquo;s ability to pay to be used as a sole basis for determining rates. It is  therefore clear that a different system must be employed. The motion calls for  consideration of a &ldquo;full income-based system&rdquo;. While I doubt strongly that an  income-based system is the way forward, I welcome the call for a review to lay  out all the different possibilities, so that the House &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I thank the hon Member for giving way. He is touching on an important point.  The amendments, along with the motion, concentrate on exemptions, and that is  right and proper for people on a low income. However, should we not also look  at increasing disposable income across society so that the take is not reduced  because of the exemptions that must be introduced?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  The hon Member for East Londonderry has made a  good point. There is no doubt that we should look in detail at the level of  relief given to vulnerable groups in our society. The DUP has already called  for a 25% rate reduction for single pensioners living alone. Most often it is  the older people, living in family homes for a long time, who find themselves  in financial difficulty when faced with rate bills that continue to rise.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This issue should not be looked at in isolation, as my hon  Friend and colleague has said. The ongoing negotiations with the Chancellor can  make a significant impact. The reinvestment and reform initiative, a hallmark  of devolution under the Belfast Agreement, shackled householders to huge rates  hikes simply to allow the then Northern Ireland Executive to access borrowing.  That situation cannot and should not be allowed to continue. It will be a  significant step forward if we can break the  link between local tax levels in England  and the regional rate in Northern    Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is little point in claiming that there is going to be a simple solution to the problems of rating.  However, it is an issue that this party has taken to the electorate, and  we have clearly received an overwhelming mandate to take the issue seriously.  That was demon&shy;strated by our taking the Finance and Personnel portfolio as our  first choice in Government. I have every confidence that the Minister who has  been appointed to that position will ensure that delivery is a hallmark of the  policies that we have set out. I look forward  to working with the Minister and the Committee and hope that we will be  able to bring to the House a review on terms that are acceptable and able to be  implemented.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland does not have unlimited resources.  It is vital that the best efforts be made to make sure that those resources are  distributed to the benefit of all in our community. I hope that a review of  rating will be combined with a cutting back of much of the waste that has been  a hallmark of devolution in the past.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Time, please.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been some time since we have had full-blown debates  in the Chamber, but the convention has been that Members do not refer to the  Public Gallery. We have been getting back into the habit very quickly.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I commend the two Members who have  brought this motion. The introduction of the new rating system was universally  criticised across the North of Ireland. The issue has been to the forefront of  people&rsquo;s concerns since the changes were announced last year against the wishes of the vast majority of the  population, who see them as a way for the Government to force more money  out of those who, in many cases, do not have the ability to pay.</p>
		    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker  [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We were told that the rates were being brought into line  with payments in England  and that we had had it easy for many years and were not paying our way.  However, that does not take into consideration the facts that people here pay  higher prices for fuel, both domestic and commercial, that food is more  expensive in general, and that the cost of living is comparatively high here. Add in our low earnings and high  unemploy&shy;ment and an altogether different picture is painted.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those in power &mdash; and their advisers &mdash; chose to ignore those  very relevant issues. Why did they not leave the old system in place so that an  incoming Assembly could deal with it? They chose to do that with other matters,  but they knew that while local politicians may not agree on every element of  what would be required, once at the helm the Assembly would at least have looked at the matter sympathetically. In  fact, the last Executive commissioned a review of the rating system, but were  unable to complete the job before the Assembly collapsed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Direct rule Ministers argued that the present system was  fair and would benefit those most in need. Such nonsense! If it is that good,  why did they not push to have it introduced in their own constituencies? Many  of those responsible for its introduction here are the same people who came out strongly against the poll tax.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently called for a radical review of  the rating system. We would prefer to scrap the  rates altogether and introduce a system of progressive direct taxation.  Consequently, we believe that the rating system in the Six Counties needs a  radical overhaul, in the context of a complete review of the Barnett formula.  We also need a meaningful peace dividend and the granting of tax-varying powers  to the Assembly and the Executive.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the meantime, equality and ability to pay must be at the  heart of any continued rating system. Also, the system must be made  transparent. It must be fair, with a clear relationship between rates, income,  value for money and the quality of service provided.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The current system does not distribute the rates burden  fairly. In particular, the failure to address the correlation between house  values and income means that many people will be in the unacceptable position  of being asset rich but income poor, and will pay higher rates than they can  afford.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Rates relief should be addressed through an income-related  system, which is based on ability to pay and has specific exemptions for  economically vulnerable groups such as older people, those with disabilities  and other low-income householders.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some people with disabilities are forced to adapt their  homes to enable them to live with dignity &mdash; their circumstances should be taken  into account in any rating system. The rating system must address disadvantaged  and low-income groups in a meaningful way. The British Government&rsquo;s scheme, in  its present form, does not address those core issues, which are essential  criteria and which must be at the heart of any review.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I take the opportunity to welcome you on your first occasion in the Chair, Mr  Deputy Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that a review of rating policy is  required. Many objections to the capital value system have been well aired this  morning. I will dwell on the concerns about local income tax that were  overlooked, perhaps understandably, by the proposer. Having listened to him,  one might be forgiven for thinking that local  income tax is a panacea for all of our taxation ills.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is some popular support for an income-based system.  Recently, the Lyons Inquiry, which examined local government finance in England, found  that half of its respondents were in favour of some, or all, local taxation  being raised through an income-based tax. However, four-in-ten people did not  express a view, which suggests that there is a lack of knowledge about the  implications of such a system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A local income-based tax system would result in significant  rebalancing &mdash; from retired householders to the working-age population &mdash; and  this is where a judgement is required. Do Members want retired householders to  pay less, on average, than younger, working householders?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is often said during discussions about local income tax  &mdash; and was repeated by the proposer &mdash; that any system should be based on ability  to pay. However, Members must consider which definition of the phrase &ldquo;ability  to pay&rdquo; should be applied. There are some attractions about a scheme that is  purely based on income. However, should retired householders with modest  incomes, but significant savings, or equity, pay less than a young family with  a slightly larger income but no assets?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Income-based tax has been a hot topic in the recent  Scottish election. Professor David Bell of Stirling University  has illustrated the &ldquo;classic case&rdquo; of a household comprising a fireman, a nurse  and their young family. He found that that household would be &pound;73 worse off  under a Liberal Democrat plan for a local income-based tax system &mdash; a plan that  has had some support from the Alliance Party Members.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Are there implications for a local government that is  financed through local income tax? Would resources rise and fall because income  yields would create uncertainty for councils in bad times, with the risk, and  temptation, of over-extension in good times?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The ease with which such a scheme would be implemented  should also be examined. Any new tax inevitably creates complex and often  unforeseen problems. I am sure that Members agree that we want a simpler and fairer tax system. Taking that tax  at source would inevitably lead to more stress for businesses, which are  already burdened by bureaucracy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">David Watt of the Scottish Institute of Directors has said  that a local income-based tax would be an anti-business measure that could  impact on competitiveness and add to the tax collection burden for businesses.  My impression is that Members want to increase competitiveness in Northern Ireland,  and that no one wants to see businesses burdened by more bureaucracy and red  tape.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A local income-based tax system is attractive on paper,  especially because of the general view that ability to pay translates into fairness,  but it is easy to overlook that such a system has serious limitations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There would be a substantial increase in tax for the  working population, potentially less stable funding for local government than  current streams, and an undoubted effect on business. Any change to any tax  system will result in winners and losers, and a local income tax would simply  create different winners and different losers.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish you well in your appointment as Deputy Speaker of  this House. I will speak today on the amendment proposed by my hon Friend Roy  Beggs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The changes introduced to the rating system by direct rule  Ministers were one of the most distasteful aspects of the direct rule regime.  They occasioned widespread public outcry and a deep sense of public unease at  their unfairness. They became the cause of major public protest. It would be  fair to say that outrage over the rates was  a major factor in determining the public mood that ultimately led to the  restoration of this Assembly. It was not just a matter of the substance of the  rates proposals, but of the way the direct rule Ministers handled the public  outcry &mdash; their attitude bordered on dismissiveness, if not actual contempt.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At the very heart of my concern about the rates issue is  the disproportionate impact it will have on many senior-citizen households. The  ability to pay a tax has to be a major factor in how publicly acceptable that  tax is. That is why a review of the ability of many senior-citizen households  to pay the tax must be undertaken and why rates bills must include a  significant rebate for older people living on fixed incomes. Many elderly  people live on fixed incomes and pensions and are in no position to meet  massively increased rates demands. They cannot increase their incomes and  cannot reasonably be expected to sell their homes, their major asset, to pay  their rates bills.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those homes are not just houses, but family homes. In many  cases, older people have lived all their lives and brought up their families in  those homes. There is something deeply personal about a home &mdash; especially as a  person gets older. Those homes are filled with memories and have a real sense  of place for their occupants.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The distress caused by this issue cannot be overstated.  Older people could not have predicted the massive boom in house prices  recently. Could any of us have predicted that 10 years ago? Therefore they were  in no position to plan for such an eventuality throughout their lives. Thus,  significant rebate must be built into the system for older ratepayers on fixed  incomes and that issue must become a basic focus of any review of the rating  system that Ministers set up.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that older people&rsquo;s homes are now worth a lot more  makes no material difference to them. They will never see the value of their  homes unless they sell them, which is unthinkable for many. They may be asset  rich, but their income stream may be incapable of absorbing new rates bills and  water charges.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Societies change and older people often get left behind.  There are 200,000 more people living here than there were decades ago, and  large numbers of people are returning to Northern Ireland now that civil  strife has ended and the political landscape has changed. Furthermore, people  are living longer.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is small wonder, therefore, that house prices have risen  with the pressure of demand. It is also true that they have risen because of  planning restrictions. Both factors have impacted disproportionately on  first-time buyers and older people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the light of these arguments, I ask the House to  advocate a review of the rating system that will give special consideration to  generous rebates for older people living on fixed incomes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The eyes of the people are on us, and we must not fail  them.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I congratulate  you on your appointment as one of the Assembly&rsquo;s Deputy Speakers and join other  Members in welcoming you to the first sitting over which you have presided.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Few issues are more important to householders in Northern Ireland  than the level of local taxes that they have to pay. I congratulate the two  Members from North Down on securing this debate at such an early opportunity  and thank all the Members who have contributed. The return of devolution can make  a real and meaningful difference on this issue. I welcome the opportunity to  put my views on record and to set out how I intend to proceed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although it will not be for the Minister of Finance <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">and Personnel alone to determine the future  arrangement</span>s for rating in Northern Ireland, I will ensure  that any proposals that are brought to the Assembly and the Executive represent  a fair deal for householders.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As someone who fought for election on a manifesto  commitment to review the present rating arrangements, I am glad that the motion  and, indeed, the amendments are broadly consistent with that outlook. Today&rsquo;s  debate has helped to focus on many of the failings of the present arrangements.  That is the easy bit; the real challenge is to devise arrangements that can  command widespread support and be seen to be fair.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me make it clear  that I am committed to reviewing the arrangements for domestic rates in Northern Ireland.  I intend, in the next few weeks, to bring a paper before the Executive setting  out the steps that I propose to take. I agree with the Chairperson of the  Finance and Personnel Committee that it is important that rating reform be  viewed in the context of how the Executive intend to address the funding of  water in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past five years in Northern Ireland, extensive  research and consultation has been conducted on the rating issue. In Great Britain,  Sir Michael Lyons has recently conducted a  lengthy review of local government finance. What is needed now in Northern Ireland  is not a lengthy analysis but a short-term review that can deliver changes by  next April and consider what further long-term steps should be taken.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must not only achieve as fair a rating system as  possible; we must also ensure that the system does not place too great an  overall burden on householders as a whole. Recent years have seen some  unprecedented increases in the level of the regional rate, with an increase of  19% in 2006-07. Such increases are neither sustainable nor acceptable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In this financial year, the domestic regional rate is  forecast to contribute &pound;240 million to public spending in Northern Ireland.  Put another way, that represents about 2&middot;5% of planned departmental  expenditure. Each 1% increase in the domestic regional rate provides a little  over &pound;2 million in additional spending power. Therefore, increases in the  regional rate can have a big impact on householders but a limited impact on  public spending.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I will give way on this occasion. However, if I am to respond to the remarks  made by each Member who spoke, I cannot give way again.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Minister confirm that if, as a result of his review of the rating  system, domestic rates are revalued, the process will be carried out on a revenue-neutral  basis and will not lead to an increase in the regional rate?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: The mechanism for determining the regional rate is that the  Executive determine what the Budget requires from the regional rate, which  amount is then divided based on the valuation of all eligible properties. Therefore, the only distinction in a  revaluation is the extent to which one person&rsquo;s property is out of  kilter with the other valuations. The overall intake is the same, and,  therefore, the process is revenue neutral.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I was saying, a 1% increase in the domestic regional  rate provides a little over &pound;2 million in additional  spending power. By comparison, the proposed efficiency targets of 3% per annum for each Department over the  comprehensive spending review (CSR) period will free up &pound;790 million of  additional spending power by 2010-11. A modest increase in the current  efficiency target to 3&middot;5% a year would  raise an extra &pound;120 million.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As well as mapping out the long-term options for raising  revenue in the Province, it is essential that short-term measures be considered  in any review. As I said, I intend to carry  out an early review of the domestic rating system. As part of that  review, the effectiveness of the new relief packages, which are already on  offer, will be examined. There are better ways of delivering relief to those  who are most deserving, and we need to examine the options for doing so.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We also need to look at ways of encouraging the most  vulnerable, particularly elderly people, to take up the reliefs that they are  entitled to. I will be urgently seeking ways of making improvements in this  area. Enhanced assistance for pensioners has recently been put in place; it  provides additional relief for pensioners on  lower incomes. I want to ensure that all those entitled to this relief  are aware of it and take advantage of it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion includes a proposal that would require new  legislation, which could not be completed in time for the next rate bills, even  if the proposal were considered sound and approved by the Executive and  Assembly. There are issues, then, that could only form part of a long-term  review. Whatever the possibilities for change in the longer term, we must be  able to make changes that can be in place for next April.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is scope for change within the existing legislation  to deliver alternative or supplementary income-based reliefs. Options such as  circuit-breakers, which would ensure that no household paid more than a certain  percentage of its income on rates, must be examined as part of any review.  Although there are many administrative difficulties with this approach, it  could offer significant benefits, providing we can deliver it easily, which  means within the scope of the existing legislation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Other changes that could be made quickly and without the  need for new primary legislation include the introduction of a minimum payment  or a change to the level of the cap. In addition, we have the power to  introduce the rating of vacant homes or to bring in a deferment scheme for  pensioners. Although I am uneasy about a number of these options, it is  important that any review examine all of them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are no easy answers. Difficult choices will have to  be made. Rating is distinct from other forms of taxation because the amount of  money to be raised is decided first each year as part of the Budget process of  the Assembly and the district councils, and the individual bills are worked out  accordingly. Therefore, providing more reliefs will either add to everyone  else&rsquo;s bills or lead to money being foregone.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This will inevitably lead to difficult choices for the  Executive to make, and, at a time when increases in public spending are at their lowest for a decade, there are  significant spending pressures. People will not tolerate spiralling local taxes  when they believe that there are significant inefficiencies in the public  sector. That places a huge responsibility on the Executive to ensure that every  pound of public expenditure is well spent.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A complete overhaul of the system is within the power and  reach of the Assembly. However, more significant change, such as bringing in a  purely income-based system, would take longer to achieve, if it were thought to  be appropriate. As an incoming Executive, we have an obligation to ensure that  a fairer system is in place for next year&rsquo;s rate bills. In the coming months, I  will look at the evidence carefully and bring back proposals to my ministerial  colleagues, the Finance and Personnel  Committee and the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members raised a number  of points during the debate and, in the short time available, I want to  respond to as many of them as possible. I have no doubt that, in the months  ahead, we will return to this subject. Certainly we will do so before  conclusions are reached.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The option of a local income tax has been suggested as an  alternative to a property tax. Although this cannot represent a short-term solution, it should be considered, if  only to be rejected, as part of any review. I agree with the Member for  Strangford Mr Hamilton that this option is not a panacea to the problem, as  many have suggested it is. It could only be  done with the agreement of Parliament and would require an amendment to  the Northern Ireland Act 1998. Evidence suggests that a local income tax system would be expensive to  introduce, difficult to administer and open to fraud.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Research has demonstrated that people expect to benefit  from a local income tax to a greater degree than would, in fact, be the case.  It is estimated that to entirely replace the current regional rate in Northern Ireland,  about 7p would have to be added to the basic rate of income tax. Despite that,  I shall not rule out the option, but we must be realistic about the timescales  and the likely costs, as well as other factors. All of those matters must be carefully considered. Nevertheless,  without prejudice to the outcome of such an analysis, the existing system can be made more income sensitive.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for North Down Mr Brian Wilson mentioned the  position of single pensioners. I understand that the assistance available  through the enhanced relief scheme goes further than that provided for single  pensioners in Great Britain.  As Members consider the amendment that was  tabled by the Member for East Antrim Mr Beggs, it should be noted that  enhanced assistance has been recently introduced, which provides additional  relief for pensioners on lower incomes. I want to ensure that all those who are  entitled take advantage of that scheme. One way of doing that is to examine the  case for applying a non-means-tested relief for pensioners, which can be  provided automatically.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to those Members who spoke about non-means-tested reliefs; I will take their views  seriously and consider them carefully as part of the early review. However, such an option would require new  legislation, which could not be completed in time for the next set of  rates bills, even if the proposal were approved.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan mentioned the mammoth task that was carried out  by the staff and officials of the Department of Finance and Personnel. I  welcome Mr O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s acknowledgement of the difficulty of valuing more than  700,000 properties. If those who criticised the Department had put their  complaints in the context of the task confronted by those officials and staff,  they would have reached the same conclusion as Mr O&rsquo;Loan, and I welcome his  remarks on that matter.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairman of the Committee for Finance and Personnel, Mr  McLaughlin, said that the motion and all the amendments related to it were  acceptable to him. Likewise, I do not have a problem with them. Although they  laid a different emphasis on various aspects of any review, they all ask for a  review. To that extent, the motion and the amendments are acceptable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for North Down Mr Weir mentioned the RRI and the  link with tax levels in Great    Britain. He knows &mdash; and gave me the  opportunity to say &mdash; that we were successful in our discussions with the  Chancellor of the Exchequer in breaking the link between the RRI and local  taxation, which was one of the causes of the massive rate rise in 2006.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This debate has  provided an early opportunity for the Assembly  to consider this important matter. In the months to come, the way in  which the Assembly addresses this issue will be regarded by many as a litmus  test for the success of devolution. I am determined to ensure that we can make  a difference in this crucial matter.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I appreciate the openness of the Minister of Finance and  Personnel&rsquo;s response and the various expressions of genuine concern about  achieving a fairer system &mdash; albeit from different angles &mdash; during the debate on  the motion and the amendments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Given our new situation, I hope that we can be reasonably  confident that the Assembly will not be subject to suspension. We are now best  placed to set up a review of the current unfair and unworkable rating system,  which was introduced by direct rule Minister David Hanson MP. I support the  introduction of further income-related reliefs, although I was somewhat puzzled  by the phrase &ldquo;a full income-based system&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All parties requested, or demanded, a rates review. A short  time later, the Assembly was suspended. Now that we are back, it makes sense  that we take control of the issue. It is a telling fact that the Assembly voted  to replace the former system of basing rates on rental values, which was  acknowledged to be outdated, unfair and discriminatory against those on lower  incomes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Since 2002, the SDLP has been entirely consistent in  calling for a system based on ability to pay. We opted for the capital  valuation model, with caveats, purely because we considered it to be the least  unfair of the options available. However, the effects of that model would still need to be mitigated by the  introduction of a comprehensive relief package to take account of  householders&rsquo; ability to pay: single householders; pensioners; those with  disabilities; and, indeed, those just above the benefits threshold &mdash; the new  poor. The criterion of ability to pay must be the cornerstone of rating policy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Soaring house values have had a distorting effect on house  prices. The fair rates campaign must be mentioned. Whether we like it or not,  the fair rates campaign maintained focus on the rating issue through the  election period. The campaign&rsquo;s website contains many well reasoned arguments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The fact is that Mr Hanson used Northern   Ireland as a testing ground for rating policy, when the  Govern&shy;ment did not appear to have the courage to introduce the same system in Great Britain.  Many people have felt that the rating issue was a north Down or south Belfast problem. However, the cold reality is that  sharply increasing house prices throughout Northern Ireland, coupled  with the introduction of Draft PPS 14, has led to rating policy becoming an  issue in rural areas also.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many people will be in for a nasty shock in coming years  unless there is serious rates reform. It is a debate for another day, but the  issue of more social and affordable housing and the release of public land to  that end, which could help burst the bubble, will have to be addressed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many people who bought their houses for modest prices  decades ago have seen the value of those houses go sky-high, often as a result  of development and the building of apartments and town houses. Through no fault  of their own, those people are now being penalised and face the threat of being  forced from their homes by an inability to pay their rates bills. Those people  do not want to move from their homes, but they cannot really take a few bricks  out of the walls to pay their rates bills in Chichester Street.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Itemised rates bills are required, because there is no  clarity at present. The issue of itemised billing has come up time and time  again. People want, and need, to know exactly what they are paying for. As well  as considering the many options that have  been mentioned, whether it is a pre-determined percentage of income,  non-means-tested reliefs or the introduction of an independent rates regulator, we must get to grips with the issue  and emerge from the review with a fairer system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to mention the full income-based system, which I now  know to be a reference to a local Northern Ireland tax, and which is  the preferred option of the Alliance Party. That is one option that is up for  review but, as has been said, the fact that the Scottish Parliament has  tax-raising powers &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw her remarks to a close?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  shall finish now, Mr Deputy Speaker. I look forward to the review. Any rating  system must be fair, equitable and based on ability to pay.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member&rsquo;s time is up. There can be no latitude.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  First, Mr Deputy Speaker, I offer you my congratulations. Only yesterday, when  making my maiden speech, did I understand the importance of your role and the protection that you can offer  Members who are making speeches. I offer my sincere congratulations on  that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is my privilege to make the winding-up speech on the  amendment tabled by my colleague from East Antrim Mr Roy Beggs. In doing so, I  will try to pick up on points that have been made. I was pleased that Mr Peter  Weir, a Member for North Down, has clarified that his party has not thrown in  the towel. No doubt he will be making a press statement, because his comment  will be news to some people. I was a little disappointed in the comments of the  Member for North Antrim Mr Storey, who has suggested that people such as me do  not have a contribution to make on subjects such as the rates.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some people fundamentally misunderstand the relationship  between capital and revenue, and the issue of being asset rich but cash poor  lies at the heart of that. A very unfortunate situation can arise for  pensioners, and it is no fault of their own. They can be living in a house with  a high capital value but &mdash; as was pointed out earlier &mdash; they cannot remove  bricks and take them down to the bank as payment. As an interim measure, we may  have to find a way of giving such people substantial, non-means-tested support.  I am grateful that the Minister of Finance and Personnel has stated that he  will consider that issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The time when a person can realise a capital valuation is  when he sells the house, and that is a perfectly valid option. However, we have  to consider a disgraceful situation that can arise &mdash;when people have to sell  their house to pay for their healthcare. A person might have lived all his life  making extra mortgage payments, extra rates payments and so on, but might then  &mdash; just when he needs it most &mdash; have to sell his big asset. We will have to  consider that in a review.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is especially important that we consider a rates cap. I  can think of nothing more outrageous than the fact that some pensioners in  south Belfast  appear to have to pay more in rates than either David Beckham or the previous  Prime Minister. It is fundamentally important that taxation should be fair,  should be related to ability to pay and should offer value for money.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is another issue that we have to consider in our  discussion of my hon Friend&rsquo;s amendment, and it is one on which I fundamentally  disagree with the position of the Alliance Party. It has to do with the  difference between rates and income tax. Rates are supposed to be tied to local  consumption; they are not a tax on income, which is a fundamentally different  matter. Rates are for services such as collecting waste from the bins, putting  in flowerbeds and regenerating local areas. Those services should be locally  based, and people should buy into them. The fundamental problem that can arise  is one of fairness, transparency and ease of administration.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We talked earlier about whether we should be a low-tax or a  high-tax environment. I believe that we should have a lower tax where possible  and that that tax should be collected in a way that the people of this Province  support. I support the first amendment to the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I now call on Dr Stephen Farry to wind up the debate on the  substantive motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker &mdash; and I too congratulate you on your new post.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In essence, the motion is a call for a review of the new  rating system that was introduced on 1 April 2007, a process that was begun by  the previous devolved Executive before it was suspended. Although its result  may not have been precisely what that Executive had in mind, the review was far  too limited in scope. That point has been reflected in the Chamber today.  Specifically, the review did not include consideration of sufficient  income-based reliefs or of a full income-based system &mdash; as was pointed out by  the Alliance Party at the time.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is notable that the Lyons Review into local government  finance in England and Wales, and the Burt Review in Scotland,  considered that option, as Brian Wilson pointed out.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The minor tweaking of the creation of a &pound;500,000 cap on  bills is not sufficient to address the range of concerns with the current  system. If anything, it introduces further unfairness. Politicians from all  parties in the Assembly have pointed to dissatisfaction with the new system.  That dissatisfaction needs to be followed up by supporting a full review that  considers all of the options. The motion does not ask Members to endorse any  particular reform, but rather to ensure that all options remain on the table.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to the Members who contributed to the debate,  particularly the Minister. I am very pleased that he is prepared to launch a  full review into the system, the terms of which we await with great interest. I  am also pleased that he has, at least, accepted that the issue of a local income tax can be kept on the table.  Although he may not feel that such a tax is appropriate, if it is on the  agenda, we are prepared to argue the case. We shall await with interest the  response from people of Northern    Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The difficulty with the amendment tabled by Roy Beggs from  the Ulster Unionist Party is that it focuses solely on pensioners. Mr Beggs  called for a non-means-tested review, whereas Mr Gardiner suggested that it  should be means tested. Addressing the needs of pensioners alone will pass more  of a burden back onto families &mdash; whom Mr Beggs was so keen to protect in his  initial remarks. The amendment from the Ulster Unionists essentially rules out  a local system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has made great  play of the issue of ability to pay, yet, once again, the idea of a  local income tax or local income-based system was dismissed. The SDLP seems to  think that we can edge towards such a system by introducing more reliefs. In  effect, that would create more bureaucracy, whereas a full income-based system  is much cleaner. If, in using the term &ldquo;ability to pay&rdquo;, the SDLP means taking  into account someone&rsquo;s assets, it is worth remembering that many pensioners  deliberately put their savings aside to finance  themselves for 20 or 30 years beyond retirement. In the absence of free personal care, paying for one&rsquo;s old age is something that many people have to bear in  mind.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The problems with the rates system have been well aired. A  property-based system is inherently unfair; the value of property is a very  blunt measure of ability to pay. The system struggles to adequately reflect  personal or household circumstances, with those on fixed incomes, such as pensioners,  most affected. Ultimately, those who are asset rich but income poor face the  greatest problems. Many people find them&shy;selves in the situation where the  family home, in which they have lived for many years, has shot up in value due  to a booming housing market while their income has not kept pace.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Single people are also particularly affected in comparison  to those in larger households who live in properties of similar value but  inevitably place a greater strain on a range of services. Mr Basil McCrea made  the point that rates are based on the services that people use. That is false:  people living in the same street in similar-sized houses pay the same rates,  irrespective of whether the council empties their bin or whether they use the  entire range of council services, from leisure centres downwards.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The regional rate is the only means through which the  Northern Ireland Administration can raise additional funds and balance the  books. Previously, the purpose of the regional rate was to reflect the services  charged by councils to ratepayers in Great Britain. In Northern Ireland,  however, those services were provided by central Government. Since 1999, the  regional rate has been used to fund general services, particularly the  reinvestment and reform initiative, which the Minister mentioned. Therefore, Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where a  property tax is used to fund central Government services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past few years, the people of Northern Ireland  have suffered considerable hikes in their rates; Mr Weir and Mr Robinson  mentioned a figure of 19%. If the Executive continue to use that system, such  unfairness will be magnified. The move from rental values to capital values  essentially only tinkered with an already unfair system. Much more fundamental  change is required.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Simply capping the rates is not the solution. The Alliance  Party is wary of caps, which are blunt instruments,  and the impact of which tends to be regressive. It is worth noting that  the Lyons Report suggests that council-tax capping be removed in England and Wales. The current &pound;500,000 cap may  help some people who are experiencing difficulties, but it provides no comfort  for others. That cap also allows millionaires to escape paying their fair share  of moneys. The cost of lost revenue from a cap will have to be found elsewhere  in the system; that entails spreading the cost around other ratepayers. Simply  lowering the cap to &pound;300,000 will increase the system&rsquo;s unfairness rather than  dealing with the problems. Members have mentioned other relief schemes, which the Alliance Party is happy to  consider.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The idea of an income-based rating system has caused much  controversy, but it could replace either the regional rate or both the regional  and district rates. Both of those options are available. That may require legislation from Westminster. However, if the Assembly  agrees that that is the way forward, it can approach Westminster for that measure.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The claim that an income-based system inevitably means tax  increases is a huge red herring. An income-based system would simply replace  the property-based system. It would be a different, and fairer, way of  redistributing the same tax burden; it is revenue neutral. The point is made  that some people could be paying hundreds of additional pounds in income tax  each year. It must be borne in mind that an income-based system would replace  the hundreds or thousands of pounds that people currently pay in their rates  bills.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The decision on how much money to raise from the system  would lie in politicians&rsquo; hands, and that is the case with the rates system  today. The SDLP&rsquo;s proposition for the appointment of a revenue regulator is  interesting. That party would appear to suggest that the Assembly cannot be  trusted to take decisions on taxation and expenditure, which is what Members  were elected to do. It seems to be an admission that some parties in the  Assembly are incapable of taking balanced decisions about money.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In any redistribution of the tax burden, there will  inevitably be winners and losers. Some people claim that families will be  particularly hard hit. However, the income-tax system already takes account of  family situations and whether people have children.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">An income-based system would pose new administrative  challenges, but I doubt that a new system would be much more complex than the  management of the current rates system. The introduction of an income-based  system into Northern Ireland  may even carry some opportunities. All citizens share the same BT postcode, and  all taxpayers&rsquo; home addresses are available from Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and  Customs. For Mr Beggs&rsquo;s information, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs is the  new name for the Inland Revenue; he was not aware of that fact in his earlier  comments.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Thank you for that.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I am glad to keep Members up to date with developments. Tax codes can be modified geographically.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Lyons Report holds open the door for the intro&shy;duction of a local income-based system in England and Wales. If that can be done in England and Wales,  consideration should be given to it being done in Northern Ireland. As Mr Hamilton mentioned, the report  found that there was strong support for that option.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Finance and Personnel said that the issue  of how revenue is raised cannot be considered in isolation from public  expenditure in Northern    Ireland. I cannot stress how important those  comments are. Northern    Ireland depends hugely on the UK Treasury.  That situation will not be allowed to be sustained in the long run,  notwithstanding any financial package that the Assembly may receive in the  short term.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If the Assembly is to avoid passing further unsustainable  burdens on to the people of Northern    Ireland, it must promote economic growth and  expand the local tax base. It must also address the inefficiencies and costs in  the system. The Minister referred to the 3%  efficiencies in the 2007 comprehensive spending review.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party has  also pointed to an annual cost of some &pound;1 billion that is spent on  trying to manage a divided society. That sum dwarfs the amount of money that is raised by the rates. The Office of the  First Minister and the Deputy First Minister has commissioned a report  from Deloitte, which will be published shortly. That report will set out the  issues in detail.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party believes that our motion reflects the  wide range of available options. Both amendments are unnecessary and, if  anything, contradict each other. Our motion represents the best way forward and  keeps all the options on the table. I urge the Assembly to support the motion.</p>

		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Health Prescription Charges</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow one and a half hours  for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have ten minutes to propose and  ten minutes to make the winding-up speech. Other Members will have five minutes  each. One amendment has been received and has been published on the Marshalled  List. The proposer of the amendment will have ten minutes to propose and five  minutes to make his winding-up speech.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls upon the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to establish a cost and benefit review for the  purpose of abolishing health prescription charges as has been carried out in Wales.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Alliance Party&rsquo;s spokesman on health, social services and public safety, I wish to see the best  possible health provision for  everyone living in Northern    Irel<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; ">and</span>, and I am sure that all Members agree with me. To  that end, I hope that the Assembly will support my call to the new Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Michael McGimpsey, who I am glad to  see in the Chamber, to initiate a cost-and-benefit review for all current  prescription charges.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, I am happy to support the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party&rsquo;s policy on health provision continues to be that the service should be free to  patients at the point of delivery;  funded through general taxation; available to all on the basis of need;  and universally and equally accessible by everyone.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The National Health Service was introduced throughout the United Kingdom  in 1946, and it was to be free from any charges. However, in 1949 a new Act was  introduced to permit charges for prescriptions, and it came into force on 1  June 1952. Prescription charges were abolished in 1965, and prescriptions  remained free until June 1968 when charges were reintroduced. Those charges  remain throughout the UK to  this day, with the exception of Wales  where all prescription charges have been abolished from 1 April 2007.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate the National Assembly for Wales on the  planned and gradual way it abolished prescription charges. The Welsh Assembly&rsquo;s  main reason for abolishing the charges was that it wanted to ensure that people  would not be put off going for their medication due to cost, and that patients  would get the medication they required to improve their health and, ultimately,  their quality of life. The Welsh Assembly  also reckoned that people who were on modest incomes and who had chronic  illnesses might not have been eligible for free prescriptions under the  previous exemption system, which could be complicated.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Research has shown that costs have prevented patients  availing of healing drugs, and that the long-term costs to the NHS could end up  being much greater through avoidable hospital treatment having to be carried  out.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">UK  regions have different opinions on prescription charges. Scotland has  promised to reform its system and introduce more exceptions for chronic  conditions, students and people on low incomes. England retains prescription charges, but its health Minister has  pledged that increases will not go  above the rate of inflation and that  all proceeds from these charges will go straight back into front-line  services. At present, we in Northern    Ireland have to pay for prescriptions,  although it is now estimated that some 90%  of people get prescriptions free of charge for one reason or another.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Our challenge today is  to ensure equality of treatment for everyone in Northern Ireland.  My information is that everyone in the Republic of Ireland  is entitled to either free or subsidised approved prescription drugs and  medicine and certain medical and surgical aids and appliances.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In asking the Minister to instigate a cost-and-benefit  review on prescription charges, there are many factors to be considered. For instance, how much does it cost the Health  Service to administer the prescription system? What is the revenue from prescriptions in the context of the wider health budget? How can we reduce prescription  fraud, which was estimated in 2005-06 to amount to almost &pound;7.6 million? Should  free prescriptions for Northern Ireland be introduced on a single date, or should we gradually reduce the cost of prescriptions as  happened in Wales?  What has to be done to ensure that patients comply  and take their prescribed medication? The review must answer these and many more questions, taking into account  the voices of local general practitioners (GPs).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also a fear that if all prescriptions were free,  patients would simply telephone surgeries and ask for medication that can be  bought over the counter, thus giving our already hard-pressed GPs extra and unnecessary work. The review must consider, in  addition, the overall benefit to the National Health Service and how to  make a real and visible improvement in Health Service provision.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, we acknowledge the efforts of one of our  leading newspapers the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; to establish a level playing field for all patients by seeking the  total abolition of these charges. Indeed, I warmly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s  published views on this important subject and his eagerness to have a review of  it. Now he has the opportunity to respond positively to my proposals today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask Members to support the motion and the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan:</strong> I beg to move the following  amendment: After &ldquo;Wales&rdquo;  insert</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&nbsp;&ldquo;; and to review the  list of conditions that currently entitle patients to free prescriptions in  order to reduce anomalies.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Prescription charges were first introduced in 1952 and,  except for a three-year period between 1965 and 1968, they have been levied  ever since.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A person can qualify for  exemption on three grounds: age,  financial status or medical condition. It is estimated that around 50%  of the population qualifies for free prescriptions  under the current exemption arrangements.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, because this group includes children, the elderly  and people with chronic health conditions, all of whom are high users of  medicine, it is estimated that over 90% of items dispensed could be supplied to  patients free of charge.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Undoubtedly there are arguments in favour of prescription  charging. It places a value on the medicine that  patients require, helps reduce the level of less urgent demands on GPs&rsquo;  time and provides a much needed source of revenue for the National Health  Service.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are indications that between a quarter and a fifth of people would be more likely to go to their  doctors for prescriptions if prescriptions were free to all. Dropping prescription charges might lead to an  increased demand on doctors&rsquo; time and for prescriptions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As indicated in the amendment, current exemption  arrangements contain certain anomalies that need to be addressed. Any changes  to the present system should be straightforward and easy for patients to  understand. Secondly, the impact of any  changes should not increase the administrative burden on GPs and  community pharmacists. Some chronic conditions are currently exempt while  others are not.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The argument is made  that it is one thing for diabetics, for instance, to receive free  prescriptions for their condition, but quite another that they should receive  free prescriptions for conditions unrelated to diabetes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, it may prove  difficult to determine whether one medical condition is related to  another. In addition, some conditions can cause secondary problems or can affect  sufferers&rsquo; general health. For example, the symptoms that affect sufferers of  multiple sclerosis are wide-ranging. They include fatigue, pain, spasms,  depression, incontinence and other problems. Drawing a distinction between  drugs that relate to multiple sclerosis may, therefore, be difficult.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, it has been recognised that treatment of the  main condition may cause side effects for which a prescription is also  required. Furthermore, a patient may suffer from an illness that is unrelated  to the exempt condition, but which may, nonetheless, lead to a deterioration of  that condition if left untreated.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Concern has also been expressed that limiting exemption to  treatment for the main condition would require significant changes to be made  to current administrative systems, which would be costly. From a processing  perspective, it would be difficult to have some items on a prescription form  that were exempt from charges and others that were not. It has even been  suggested that such changes could cost more than the complete abolition of  charges for people who have a chronic condition.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Another idea is to base exemptions on a list of drugs  rather than on a list of conditions. However, there are several drawbacks to  that suggestion. The extra bureaucracy required to maintain the list of drugs  may prove costly. There would be a potential time lag between new drugs coming  on to the market and their addition to the list of exempt drugs. The  feasibility of developing a list of drugs that includes all of those medicines  that are required to treat even common chronic conditions is questionable. As  many drugs are used to treat more than one condition, drugs-based exemption  from charges might be granted not just to those who have chronic conditions,  but also to those who have minor ailments or short-term acute illnesses who may  be less in need of assistance with charges. For example, antibiotics can be  prescribed for anyone who has a cough. For a patient who has cystic fibrosis,  however, the consequences of not taking antibiotics are severe. That is not the  case for other patients.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some people have suggested that there be a reduced flat fee  for prescriptions. The main argument in favour of that is that all patients  would contribute something to the cost of their medicine, which would provide  much-needed revenue to the NHS. There is no doubt that some of those people who  are already exempt from charges could afford to pay something towards their  medication.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For patients who require many prescriptions, a more  affordable option is to purchase a prescription prepayment certificate (PPC). Those can be cost-effective when a  patient needs several items over many months. The  PPC system could be improved by allowing patients to pay in instalments,  issuing PPCs retrospectively and publicising the system better. For patients  who are not exempt on the grounds of income,  but who require many or frequent prescriptions, the prescription  prepayment certificate presents a more affordable way of paying for their  medication.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is recognised that the PPC system has several  shortcomings; in particular, the size of the upfront fee may present  difficulties for some patients, particularly those who are on lower incomes.  Options include abolition of the system of upfront payment and allowing  patients to pay in instalments with the option of paying by direct debit, standing order or by a stamp-scheme  system. Some people favour the retrospective issuing of PPCs to patients who  incur significant but unanticipated charges during a set period.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are many varied  ideas on prescription charging. Representatives of the Royal College of  General Practitioners have suggested replacing the current charging and  exemption arrangements with a patient co-payment system, similar to those that  exist in other countries, in which charges  vary for different categories of drugs. They have also stated that it  would be worth examining experiences elsewhere, such as the current French  system in which patients receive a higher level of reimbursement for  evidence-based treatment than for newer or more expensive medication, which is  not necessarily more effective.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In such a model, it is likely that the great majority of  prescription medicines &mdash; perhaps 90% &mdash; would be free to the patient. That would require the categorisation of all  medicines. However, as a first step toward addressing this important issue,  Members should seek to review the list of exempt conditions.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mrs Michelle O&rsquo;Neill. She will be making her maiden speech,  and it is the convention that it be heard uninterrupted.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am pleased to have the  opportunity to make my maiden speech on an issue that has an impact on the  lives of so many people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in is determined to create a society in which  inequalities in health provision are eradicated. To that end, we launched a  campaign for free prescriptions over a year ago, which we took to most councils  in the North. It received universal backing.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in notes that the graduated abolition of  prescription charges over one electoral term was in the UUP manifesto, and we  will support the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in  achieving that worthy goal.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Prescription charges should be redundant in the Health  Service, which is supposed to be free at the point of delivery. The current  cost &mdash; almost &pound;7 per prescription &mdash; has the detrimental effect of excluding  many people from receiving the correct medical treatment. People on low incomes  cannot access the medications that they need. That cannot be allowed to  continue, and Members must end charging now.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in recognises that it may take some time to  implement, as it did in Wales.  In the interim, we urge the Minister of Health to go the extra mile and to  adopt our recommendations from last year concerning the list of chronic  conditions that qualify for exemption. As other  Members have said, that list was compiled in 1968, is no longer fit for  purpose and must be modernised. There have  been tremendous advances in pharmacology in the 40 years since the  exemption list was compiled. Sinn F&eacute;in urges the Minister to immediately widen  it to include long-term conditions such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, arthritis,  cancer, multiple sclerosis, HIV and schizophrenia, to name but a few. There  must be a more consistent approach for patients who require repeat prescriptions  for long-term medical conditions. The disparities associated with the outdated  exemption list must be addressed as soon as possible.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In its report, &lsquo;Unhealthy Charges&rsquo;, the National  Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux found that more than two thirds of those  with long-term health problems had difficulty meeting prescription charges.  That has an adverse impact on their health and raises costs elsewhere in the  Health Service due to hospital admissions and appointments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With that in mind, Sinn F&eacute;in calls on Members to support  the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert Coulter</strong>: Members have heard some lucid arguments  in favour of the motion. A look back in time may help Members to take a  long-term view.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In 1979, the prescription charge was 20p. Figures for the  retail price index, on the 1974 basis, show an increase by a factor of 6&middot;62  between 1979 and 2007. That implies that the  prescription charge could reasonably be expected to have increased from  20p to &pound;1&middot;32 &mdash; yet in 2007 it had reached &pound;6&middot;85. That is more than five times  what might have been expected due to normal inflationary  pressures. That simple arithmetical exercise shows how inflated  prescription charges have become.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is not the whole story. If prescription charges played  a significant part in recovering the cost of medicines, such an overblown  increase might be understandable &mdash; even justifiable, if all moral and ethical  issues were set aside to deal just in figures and recovery costs. However, the  picture painted by the facts shows that prescription charges are negligible in  terms of cost recovery.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2004, just 4% of the cost of prescription items was  recovered through prescription charges. Some 95%  of prescription items &mdash; 25&middot;73 million prescriptions &mdash; were not paid for  at the point of dispensing. That figure  included the 90% receiving free prescriptions and the further 5% using prescription prepayment  certificates.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2005-06 the 501 pharmacies in Northern Ireland dispensed 27&middot;1  million prescription items at a cost of &pound;340 million. Four million pounds was  received in prescription prepayment certificates, and only &pound;10 million was received in prescription charges. That  is &pound;10 million out of &pound;340 million.  The general pharmaceutical service cost some &pound;381 million in 2005-06,  and that cost was defrayed by only &pound;14  million from prescription charges and prescription prepayment  certificates.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The extent of the bureaucracy involved in administering the  system simply cannot be justified in terms of the rate of recovery. A new  prescription bar- code system, begun in 2006 and based on a &pound;6&middot;8 million  contract with Hewlett Packard, will enable whatever data recovery is necessary  on patterns of prescribing by drug, patient and doctor. That will render much  of the bureaucracy obsolete.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Quite apart from this  statistical approach, there is the ethical issue of taxing health. Make  no mistake &mdash; that is what prescription charges actually are. Strip away all the  arguments and you come back to this point. That is why the Welsh Assembly,  which has fewer devolved powers than the Northern Ireland Assembly, has  abolished prescription charges from 1 April 2007.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The purpose of levying prescription charges is now unclear.  The income from them is negligible in overall terms. We must get away from  continuing and perpetuating activities simply because we have always done them.  Levying prescription charges is one of those survivals from past practice that  no longer makes sound business sense for Government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It may be argued that we need to get back to the founding  principles of the National Health Service in this matter. The National Health  Service introduced in 1947 was a comprehensive health service that was free of  charge at the point of need. If patients are treated free of charge at the  point of need, medicines should also be free.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for a review of prescription costs and  benefits. On that basis, I support the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  The existing charging scheme in Northern    Ireland is outdated and inconsistent. A  review of the system is clearly needed. There are many inequities and anomalies  in the system. Although around four out of five prescriptions are exempt, the  price of a prescription &mdash; set at &pound;6&middot;85 from April &mdash; sometimes hits those who  cannot afford these charges.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are many people with chronic conditions who are still  not exempt. With the continued rise in prescription charges there is concern  that more patients will be discouraged from visiting the doctor when they are  ill. Research in the UK and Canada shows  that charges result in patients not taking the treatment that they require.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, prescription charges may constitute a financial  barrier to receiving treatment for a portion of the population, which would  obviously have a detrimental effect on the health of those individuals. That is  probably accurate. There are many other groups of patients who are on  long-term, or indeed lifelong, treatment, such as those with cancer, cystic  fibrosis, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and other conditions. They are certainly  disadvantaged.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, some terminally ill patients cannot afford  the cost of medicines. It would be fairer, particularly for the most  vulnerable, to extend the grounds for exemption from prescription charges to  include chronic illness. Cancer charities have recently called for the  abolition of charges for the chronically or terminally ill to be implemented as  a matter of priority. Of course, a fair legal definition of the word &ldquo;chronic&rdquo;,  on which to base the exemptions, would have to be established.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Scottish Parliament is not convinced that an equitable charging scheme can be created by  identifying exemption categories and  may be in favour of abolishing prescription charges entirely. However,  in Northern Ireland  the abolition of charges should be costed to determine whether it could be  budgeted for. It is estimated that, in Wales, free prescriptions will cost  &pound;25&middot;5 million for the first year. I have no doubt that the Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety will initiate a cost-and-benefit review to  measure the impact of abolishing prescription charges. Indeed, it might be more cost-effective to abolish charges;  the vast majority of people already do not pay for prescriptions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Another important question is whether abolition of  prescription charges will impact positively on public health and benefit the people of Northern Ireland. There is an argument that free prescriptions will result  in fewer hospital stays. Conversely,  there is an argument that free prescriptions will encourage a rise in  the number of prescriptions issued, which will put further pressure on the health budget and may not be good for public  health.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Doctors should be encouraged to prescribe less expensive generic medicines. Pharmacists should  inform patients when there is a cheaper, over-the-counter alternative to  that prescribed. Pre-paid prescriptions should be availed of and made more  flexible.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Society is very reliant upon medication, and that is not to  detract from the benefits of powerful drugs. However, these are often seen as  the only solution to health problems. Members interested in health issues will  accept that we must create a Health Service that promotes good health and  supports early intervention. People must be encouraged to take more  responsibility for their health, so that they do not become too reliant upon  medication. That is why the costing of free prescriptions is important. It will  assist those who cannot afford essential  medication. Should prescriptions become free, the prescribers &mdash; mainly  general practitioners &mdash; will have an added responsibility and will have to be  extra careful, especially with regard to repeat prescriptions. We are all aware  of individuals who are dependent on medication. Last weekend, we heard about an  eight-year-old boy who was selling his parent&rsquo;s medication. That is becoming common.  It is important to weigh the options, and remember that medicine is not a  panacea.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support both the motion and the amendment. As the Sinn  F&eacute;in spokesperson on health, I look forward to working with the Minister and  acknowledge that the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety  and he will have much work to do together.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Investing for Health strategy should be at the centre  of the Executive&rsquo;s concerns. Health, like many other policy areas, cuts across  the responsibilities of several Departments. Deprivation in north and west Belfast has been well  publicised, as have the links between ill health and poverty. In this debate  Members have consistently made the connection between those on low wages having  restricted access to prescriptions and the fact that they also suffer the  long-term effects of lack of access to primary care. Those people will be much more expensive to treat when accessing secondary  care, which will put more pressure on an already stretched Health Service.  Furthermore, it does not take into account the cost in human terms to the  individuals.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At this early stage of the Assembly, it is good that  Members are seeking to help those in most need &mdash; by trying to give them access  to services from which they are deprived due to the financial implications.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the motion and the amendment. Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr John McCallister to make his maiden speech, and I ask  Members not to interrupt.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  First, I congratulate the Members who tabled the motion for bringing the  extremely important issue of prescription  charges before the House. It is encouraging that they have read, and  agree with, the Ulster Unionist Party manifesto. It is with personal  satisfaction that I make my maiden speech on such a pressing matter.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety establishes a cost-and-benefit review, such as the motion calls for, I hope  that it would result in firm and sustainable proposals to abolish health  prescription charges. I use the phrase &ldquo;firm and sustainable&rdquo; because there  have been situations in which similar measures have been adopted and  subsequently rescinded.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The National Health Service Act 1946 did not allow for health prescription charges &mdash; those were  introduced in 1952. The founding fathers of the NHS wanted the service to be free at the point of need. It was my  party that brought the National  Health Service to Northern    Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, for many hard-working families today, the Health  Service is not free at the point of need. Those people have already paid for  their healthcare through their taxes; therefore, the present situation results  in almost double taxation. Members must agree that it has to stop.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As Rev Coulter stated, prescription charges are a tax on health, or indeed on ill health. A recent  citizens advice bureaux survey found that 37% of respondents who suffered from long-term conditions such as  arthritis could not pay for all or  part of their prescriptions because of cost. If those people cannot  afford prescriptions, their health may  deteriorate, they may be hospitalised and may cost the NHS and the  taxpayer even more money.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are serious flaws in the current exemption  regulations for prescription charges. The exemption system does not necessarily  include chronic conditions and terminal  illnesses such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, arthritis  and asthma, which means that sufferers have to pay for what could be  life-saving treatment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party wants to introduce free prescriptions, and the cost would be around &pound;14  million to the taxpayer &mdash; less than 0&middot;5% of the current health budget.  The new Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, my friend and  colleague Michael McGimpsey, has reiterated his commitment to free  prescriptions. The Welsh Assembly has delivered free prescriptions from 1 April  2007, and the Scottish Parliament may follow soon. Why should Northern Ireland be the only devolved region in  the UK  to be different?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposal to abolish prescription charges serves as an  excellent example of how devolution can benefit all of the people of Northern Ireland.  It is a prime demonstration of how the Ulster Unionist Party plans to serve the  people, and how we will strive to improve the quality of life for everyone.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  I welcome the debate and support the call for the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to examine the cost and benefits of abolishing  prescription charges. Ending prescription charges is a step towards restoring a  key principle of the National Health Service. The Ulster Unionist Party  supported free prescriptions in its manifesto, and I am delighted to see that  the measure has attracted support from all parties.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Prescription charges are effectively a tax on illness. It is an unfair system that gives free medication to  various groups who can often afford to pay, while charging numerous  other groups who may find it difficult to pay &mdash; for instance, those who have  chronic illnesses or who are on a low, modest income but who do not qualify for  income support.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The current exemption system is complicated and unbalanced.  There is a range of chronic and terminal illnesses that are not included in the  list of conditions that are exempt from prescription charges. These conditions include arthritis, asthma, cancer and  multiple sclerosis. Sufferers of those illnesses must continually pay  for medication that could effectively save their lives or at least improve  their quality of life.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is grossly unfair that 230,000 people in Northern Ireland who are affected by arthritis, many of whom have  to take a wide range of medications over a long period of time, should not be  awarded free prescriptions on the basis of their condition. Those costs are in  addition to other financial restraints such as loss or limitation of employment  and the cost of aids and adaptations that are necessary to easing their  everyday lives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Arthritis is the single largest cause of physical  disability and lost working days in Northern Ireland, yet many people  suffering from arthritis find it difficult to pay for the necessary medications  to reduce their pain. That is unacceptable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, all those suffering from cancer would benefit  from free prescriptions. Macmillan Cancer Support research has shown that one  in seven cancer patients under the age of 55, who must currently pay for  prescriptions and whose financial situations have worsened, are unable to  afford their cancer treatment. Poverty is a particular problem for people of  working age who suffer from cancer. That is deplorable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Macmillan Cancer Support research has established that, of  those people who have been diagnosed with cancer  at age 55 or younger, seven out of 10 households have suffered an  average loss of income of 50%. Furthermore, increasing numbers of cancer  patients receive their treatment as outpatients, which means that more and more people must now pay for medication  such as treatment for side effects,  long-term preventative medicines and  even treatments such as oral chemotherapy when they get home.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Prescribing medicines is often complicated, with some  medicines complementing another, and others requiring  to be taken with another drug. Two substances can sometimes be combined  into one tablet, but others cannot and must therefore be paid for separately.  That creates further financial problems for  many people who are already suffering a lot of distress.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The National Association  of Citizens Advice Bureaux found that 37% of respondents with long-term  conditions have failed to purchase all or part of their prescriptions because  of cost. It would surely be more cost effective for the National Health Service  for patients&rsquo; conditions to be adequately treated as prescribed rather than  paying for avoidable hospital treatments in the long term. Rather than select  only parts of medication that patients are prescribed, free prescriptions would  enable them to comply fully with their prescription, bringing longer-term  health benefits.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The inequalities of the current system must be eliminated.  The British Medical Association calls for a:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;fundamental review of the whole system of  prescription charges&rdquo;,</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">describing prescription  charges system as &ldquo;outdated&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The current system awards free prescriptions to 87% of the  people, but many of the remaining 13% who pay regularly for prescriptions are  suffering because of the outdated system. The National Health Service makes a  real difference to our lives, contributing in vital ways to the quality of life  of people in Northern    Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up. We need to keep within the time allotted  for the debate.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I thank the two  proposers for tabling the motion. The motion is entirely in keeping with the  Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s manifesto commitments and my already stated  determination on the issue of prescription charges. Therefore, the support of  Mr McCarthy and Dr Deeny is wholly welcome.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also thank all the Members who have spoken on the  subject. Many useful points have been made. It is not overstating the case to  say that there is strong agreement in the Chamber. I look forward to further  cross-party enthusiasm in support of my  future requests for additional health funding.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>: It is clear that prescription charges are an issue on which  Members want to make progress and that the people of Northern Ireland wish to have  addressed. That is why the Ulster Unionist Party is committed to the introduction of free prescriptions for all.  Therefore, I welcome the opportunity to bring the issue forward for review.  Indeed, I have already told my departmental officials that such a review is a  priority.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department will also seek to restore the key principle  of the National Health Service, which is that healthcare should be free at the  point of use. After all, it was a Stormont  Government that brought the National Health  Service to Northern Ireland.  Now, this Stormont Government have the opportunity to renew their commitment to the fundamental principles of the  National Health Service.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  On prescription charges, it is worth considering a number of points. Currently,  each prescription item costs &pound;6&middot;85, unless a patient is entitled to free  prescriptions. Members will be aware that there are several grounds for  exemption from paying for prescriptions.  These include age, medical condition and income. However, the implementation  of exemptions is complex and highly bureaucratic.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Until now, the direct rule Government&rsquo;s view has been that if people can afford to pay for their  medicines, they should do so. Annually, approximately 28 million  prescriptions are dispensed here. The income from charge-paying patients is  around &pound;13 million. That must be set in relief against the &pound;360 million that is  spent on medicines prescribed by GPs. Of that &pound;360 million, only a small  proportion &mdash; around 3&middot;5% &mdash; is recovered. Additionally, each year, hospital  consultants prescribe approximately &pound;100 million worth of drugs, all of which  are free to patients. Therefore, only a small proportion of the costs is  recovered as income through prescription charges.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">People who are not  exempt from prescription charges, and  who need regular medication, can reduce their costs by using pre-payment certificates. These  certificates cost &pound;98&middot;70 for 12 months. If a person buys a pre-payment  certificate, it allows him or her access to a year&rsquo;s worth of medicine for &pound;100<span style="color:#FF9900; ">.</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Approximately 90% of NHS prescription items are dispensed  free of charge: not 90% of prescriptions, but 90%  of prescription items. Although that appears to be a lot, it disguises the fact that it accounts for  approximately 28 million items.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One prescription with, for example, four items on it will  cost about &pound;27. Therefore, prescription costs can be an onerous financial  burden on families. I know only too well of large numbers of people &mdash; people  with serious, often chronic conditions &mdash; who still have to pay for the very medication that is keeping them alive.  That is not the kind of NHS that we envisage because it is not a free service.  That principle apart, there are serious inequities and weaknesses in the  current system that must be addressed. Irrespective of our views on charging for prescriptions, Members must ask whether  the current system reflects the best way to deliver medicines to those people  who need them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must consider the categories for exemption. Aside from age, pregnancy, a war disability and  income, several medical conditions are listed as exemptions, with no  apparent justification for their inclusion, while others are excluded. How does  that stack up in equality terms? Do we have a rational and robust explanation  for why one person is exempt and another is not? Why does one person&rsquo;s  suffering have a greater priority than that of another? Those are the questions  that must be answered. The rationale must be defensible on the basis of  evidence or health grounds. Why is a prescription issued by a hospital  consultant free of charge, while the same  prescription, written by a GP, for the  same illness and the same patient, attracts a charge?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no good answer to that either. Why is a  50-year-old with a serious illness charged for prescriptions, yet a 60-year-old  with a different illness, who may be better off, can get free prescriptions? I  could go on, but the point is clear. The current system cannot be the best, and  it should be changed.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety,  however, I know that my Department&rsquo;s budget is neither infinite nor a  bottomless pit. I have a responsibility &mdash; and I am well aware that Members will  hold me to that responsibility &mdash; to ensure that the budget is spent in the most  prudent, far-seeing and intelligent way for the health, social care and  well-being of the people of Northern Ireland. In short, I shall decide how and  where the health budget is best used to maximise its impact.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It worries me to hear evidence from patients and their families  that prescription charges deter some people from having their prescriptions  dispensed, either in part or entirely. The long-term costs for the Health  Service of avoidable hospital treatment would improve if patients were able to  afford the medication needed to treat their condition.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that people  who might be able to go back to work fear that, in doing so, they will  not be able to afford the prescriptions to which they were entitled when  unemployed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are many anomalies in the system. Not only is it  complex and bureaucratic, and breaks the principles of the Health Service as  laid down, it is, on several grounds, hard to justify. For example,  hard-working families feel that they are being taxed twice; they pay their  taxes for the National Health Service and, as patients, they pay prescription charges. Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  hard-working families deserve better. They deserve a National Health Service  that is genuinely free at the point of use, and that must include  prescriptions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are equality implications for the people of Northern Ireland  in ensuring fairness and social justice. Scotland,  England and Wales have  recognised the fundamental flaws in the existing system. Scotland has  concluded that the list of exemptions must be substantially extended and seeks  a fairer alternative to the present charges. In England, a review of the list of  conditions already exempt is being undertaken, and a report will be forthcoming  later in the year. England  also recognises that the existing system is flawed and not fit for its purpose.  As Members know, the National Assembly for Wales abolished prescription  charges &mdash; not all at once, but over five years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the motion, which supports my expressed intention  to establish a cost-and-benefit review for the purpose of abolishing  prescription charges. The time is right for Northern Ireland to look at  arrangements locally. My officials will establish a review that will inform how  we move forward on this question. The review group will include representatives  of the key stakeholders involved &mdash; pharmacists, doctors, and, most importantly,  patient representatives through the health and social services councils.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want the review to take full account of the needs and  wishes of patients, as well as of the practical implications for the  professionals who have to deal with the consequences. The review will involve  wide research and public consultation, and an equality impact assessment will  be undertaken. I shall ask the review group to report back to me before the end  of the year with options and recommendations. I shall bring my decisions and  proposals back to my colleagues in the Executive, the Health Committee and the  Assembly for approval.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  am delighted that the hon Member for Strangford Kieran McCarthy supports the  inclusion of the amendment proposed by my hon Friend Tom Buchanan. The issue of  prescription charges is an important one for the Assembly to debate. Our c<span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">ounterparts in the Scottish Parliament and the  Nation</span>al Assembly for Wales  have also considered the matter. Wales  has abolished prescription charges for everyone; Scotland has been more circumspect.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although free prescriptions are a fine idea in principle,  the prospect raises other significant issues that must be fully considered  before a decision can be reached. From where would the extra funding be found?  What other services might suffer as a result? Access to expensive but effective  new drugs, which is already very limited, could be reduced further.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The current exemption list should be reviewed, as it  disadvantages those with certain lifelong or terminal illnesses who depend on  regular medication. For example, patients who receive free prescriptions for  diabetes may also benefit from free prescriptions for other<span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; "> ailments. Some may ask whether that is necessari</span>ly  fair. Those patients can avail themselves  of an all-round free prescription service while others with  life-limiting cystic fibrosis cannot access free prescriptions for anything. A  review of the current list of exemptions should be carried out, and I am  delighted that the Minister has announced one this afternoon.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Initiatives to control the number of prescriptions being  issued should also be investigated, so that the service is not taken advantage  of or misused in any way. We do not want to reach a position in which  over-the-counter drugs that are already available are sidelined in favour of  free prescriptions. The sale of over-the-counter medications must be monitored.  GPs will also need to monitor whether patient demand for free prescriptions  increases. How will GPs react if that occurs?  Those patients and families who are living with terminal or lifelong  illnesses should be considered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Free prescriptions already benefit many groups of people, such as those on low incomes and women  during and after pregnancy. There is clearly an argument that those who  can afford medicines and are not dependent on prescriptions should not  necessarily be exempt. We also need to calculate the likely amount of drugs  that would be wasted if all prescriptions were to be free of charge, and,  again, how that might be monitored. If people no longer value their  medications, compliance will suffer and more money will be wasted.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It seems reasonable that patients who are subject to  compulsory treatment orders should not be expected to pay for their medication.  That should be a ground for exemption in any new list of conditions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In considering the  shape of a further list of conditions, it is widely felt that all patients  who are terminally ill or have lifelong conditions should be exempt from paying  prescription charges. It is felt that many other specific conditions should be  included on any new list. Among those most commonly mentioned are cystic  fibrosis, cancer, asthma and mental illnesses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am<span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; "> pleased to support  the motion and the amendmen</span>t.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: I  congratulate you on your appointment, Mr <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">Deputy  Speaker. A lot of people were congratulat</span>ing you yesterday. I have  worked out that if all 108 of us were to congratulate all the new Deputy  Speakers, we would be here until Christmas. I sincerely wish you well, as I do  the other Deputy Speakers and, in his absence, the Speaker himself.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is very important to me as a GP. I do not have  much to say, because it has all been said, and I do not want to be repetitive.  I am in my twenty-seventh year as a doctor. Apart from one year in Australia &mdash;  1985-86 &mdash; I have spent all that time in the NHS. I am delighted to hear the  representatives of all parties going right back to the fundamental principles  of the NHS, which was set up just after the  Second World War.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Like many GPs, I believe in the fundamentals, concepts and  ethos of the NHS: equity for all patients; free at point of use; funded through  general taxation; and available to all on the basis of need. That final point  is important, because as recently as this morning there was a radio discussion  about the possibility of people being refused healthcare, and operations, if  they are too obese, or if they smoke. That  is a dangerous and wrong road to go down. That, however, is an issue for  another day.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Healthcare should be universal, and there should be  equitable access for all. Most of my GP colleagues would agree that those are  the tenets of the NHS. I absolutely support the motion. As I am also wearing my  GP hat today, I am delighted to hear Members from all parties expressing  concern for &ldquo;poor&rdquo; GPs. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Poor? <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: I  do not mean poor in the financial sense, but certainly in the administrative  sense. That point should be taken on board.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the 26 years in which I have worked in the NHS, I have  seen huge and dramatic changes, and the cost incurred is a big issue. The spiralling costs of operations have gone through the roof, and investigative  procedures and drugs are now very expensive. A course of oral drugs for  shingles can cost more than &pound;100. That is one example of what drugs can cost in  2007.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Healthcare costs are increasing. I fully support my  colleague and namesake&rsquo;s motion, but constituents will want us to address other  equally important, or more important, healthcare issues. The important word is  &ldquo;prioritisation&rdquo;. Not enough operations are being done &mdash; waiting lists must be  tackled. There are not enough front-line healthcare workers, or enough doctors  or nurses, and the number of available hospital beds is a problem. I worked for  five years at a hospital and I have now worked for 21 years as a GP, and I cannot  accept trolley waits in modern-day healthcare. To have human beings on trolleys  waiting in hospitals is an indictment of any Health Service in the developed  world. That would not happen in a veterinary hospital, so resolving that  situation should be a priority for us all in the Assembly, in particular for  our new Minister of Health. I am delighted to see him in the Chamber, along  with several members of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public  Safety.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mental health has always been the poor sister in  healthcare. It is necessary that the Assembly look at that issue, and I think  that a will exists to do just that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have talked about 90% of prescription items being  exempt. One benefit of the introduction of free prescriptions would be that it would  do away with prescription-exemption fraud. Another issue that has been  mentioned is what GPs call &ldquo;poly-pharmacy&rdquo; &mdash; where a patient who, although not  in an exempted category, is not well off and has six or seven medical  conditions, for which they pay six or seven different charges. That is wrong.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The review should look  at certain simple medications that are currently free but that perhaps  should not be available on prescription. The dangers of having free  prescriptions across the board are that patients may not appreciate the medication and that there will be  wastage. Regardless of the situation, GPs will always have the problem  of poor compliance, which is something that will also be looked at during the  review.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong><span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</span></strong>: Does the Member agree that the primary objective of any  Executive or Government should be the promotion of the good health and  well-being of all its citizens and that one of the most significant steps  forward that the Executive could take would be to reintroduce the Investing for Health strategy at ministerial and  Executive level? I did not want to interrupt the Minister during his  announcement this afternoon.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>:  Yes, I agree.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the  amendment. I know the good Member from West Tyrone Mr Buchanan very  well, and I know that he has a deep interest in health. I agree with his  amendment, although I would prefer that the word &ldquo;criteria&rdquo; replaced the phrase  &ldquo;list of conditions&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must be careful when dealing with this matter. For  example, rubs, sprays and lotions that people currently get on script should be  taken off prescription. That issue should form part of the review. However, we  must ensure that very important medications are kept on script, and those  prescriptions should be free.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Buchanan mentioned the fact that it would be difficult  to deal with a list of drugs as opposed to a list of conditions. I do not agree  with that. Doctors would be much happier to deal with certain drugs. Indeed,  doctors would know what drugs should be on script and what ones would be better  given over the counter. For example,  somebody could ring the doctor&rsquo;s surgery to say that they have a serious  back injury and ask for a spray, but that spray may only be needed for a sports  bag. People could say that their child has a serious fever and needs Calpol,  but it may well be used just for teething. Different scenarios must be  considered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with my  colleagues across all the Benches that it is wrong that less-well-off  people who suffer from conditions such as  cancer, multiple sclerosis, debilitating rheumatoid arthritis and  chronic heart disease have to pay for prescriptions, while a 60-year-old  millionaire may well get Calpol free on  prescription. That is wrong, and it is an issue that we must consider.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People have asked how free prescriptions will be paid for.  I do not know. Again, this is a subject for discussion in the review. However,  we have been told that the reforms that will  arise from the review of public administration (RPA) will help  front-line services and will focus on patients&rsquo; needs. If those reforms do what  they say on the tin, money should be  available for many more front-line health services and for patients.  Thus, that is one area in which money could potentially be found. I was  delighted to hear the Minister say that we as  a group should push for a very substantial and decent healthcare budget.  I hope that that will be the case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must deal with all the other front-line issues &mdash;  hospital bed shortages, trolley waits, operations and mental health &mdash; and ensure that important medications  are kept on prescription while very simple medications that really do not belong there are taken off  prescription. If we can deal with all that, I believe that we can  realistically look towards the introduction of free prescriptions for all in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">Question</span>, That the amendment be  made, <span class="Italic">put and agreed to.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls upon the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to establish a cost and benefit review for the  purpose of abolishing health prescription charges as has been carried out in Wales; and to review the list of  conditions that currently entitle patients to free prescriptions in  order to reduce anomalies.</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed  to allow one and a half hours for this debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose  and 10 minutes to wind up the debate. All  other Members will have five minutes. One amendment has been received,  and it is published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will  have 10 minutes to propose and five minutes to wind up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses concern at the current state of  child and adolescent mental health services, particularly the lack of child and  adolescent in-patient beds and dearth of trained staff to run these services;  and further calls on the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety to take urgent action to address this situation in keeping with the  Bamford Review.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Business Committee for allowing this motion to  appear on today&rsquo;s Order Paper. I tabled the motion last Tuesday and its  inclusion sends the clear message that the rights of children and young people  are a priority for the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I accept the amendment proposed by Dolores Kelly and Carmel  Hanna, which adds to the strength of my motion, and I thank them for that.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker  [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the debate, I shall refer to the cases of young  people who recently died as a result of suicide. I offer my heartfelt sympathy and condolences to their  families. I hope that they will understand that I am referring to their  loved ones in order to bring about action that will help to prevent other young  people and their families from suffering in the same way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, several young people died as a result of suicide  in west Belfast.  That is more than a tragedy. At least two of those young people were being  treated for mental-health difficulties. One of them, Bronagh Gallagher, was the  teenage mother of an 11-week-old baby. Bronagh had struggled with mental-health  difficulties and had been admitted to  hospital twice &mdash; in June 2006 and at  Easter 2007 &mdash; following paracetamol overdoses. When Bronagh died last  week, she was still waiting to be referred to a psychiatric nurse. The tragic  loss of Bronagh&rsquo;s life may well have been prevented if the North had the type  of mental-health services that she needed, which offered the support that could  have helped her through her difficulties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be  painfully aware that our communities have been struggling for quite some  time with the suicides of young people such as Bronagh.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2005, Daniel McCartan died as a result of suicide on the  evening of the day on which he had requested to be admitted to psychiatric care. His request was refused because  he was considered to present a low suicide risk and no adolescent in-patient  beds were available. A complaint lodged by Daniel&rsquo;s parents is being  investigated. The results of that investigation should be reported soon, which,  hopefully, will shed more light on what can be done to prevent such tragedies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Between 2005 and 2007, what has changed for those young  people who badly need access to professional care and support? The Bamford  Review has been initiated, a suicide strategy has been formulated, and there  has been a small injection of funding, but it appears that, in practical terms,  very little has changed. I am gravely concerned about our ability to provide  the services needed by children and young people who face mental-health difficulties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2005, 213 people died as a result of suicide in the North. Of those, approximately 35% were aged  between 15 and 34. In 2006, there were 291 reported suicides. West and  north Belfast have some of the highest levels of suicide, with the rate in west Belfast standing at twice the regional  average. Make no mistake: that experience is not limited to the North &mdash; it  affects communities across the island.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a dearth of adolescent inpatient beds in the  North, as well as in the Twenty-six Counties. In each year from 2002 to 2006, 60 or more local young people had to be  placed in adult psychiatric wards because of a lack of appropriate beds.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The local child and adolescent psychiatric inpatient unit  cannot operate at full capacity because of a lack of trained staff. There is  evidence that, even now, the unit is  operating under strained staffing levels that prevent it from using all its available beds and providing  adequate staff cover for lunch and breaks. I commend the staff of the  unit because they are working under enormous strain. I heard this morning that,  on several occasions, no female members of staff are on duty, particularly  during the night.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Added to that, and equally worrying, are reports that some of the anti-depressants prescribed for children  and young people may have adverse effects and increase the risk of suicide. Surely the Minister will  agree that we need an urgent review of the drugs that are prescribed to  young people under the age of 18 and the impact of those drugs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In January of this year there were 30 vacant posts in the mental-health profession, specialising in the  treatment of adolescents. That requires a radical and urgent response. The response that young people need is  much more complex than solely increasing the number of psychiatric beds  or the number of health professionals &mdash; necessary though that may be.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is estimated that 10% to 15% of adolescents face  mental-health difficulties; locally, that means about 16,000 children and young  people. However, only a tiny minority will need the sharp-end psychiatric  services because many community-based services, if provided early, will make a  real difference. It should be &mdash; and is &mdash; possible to provide the kind of care  that young people need. The Assembly knows that the difficulties with Child and  Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) are not simply at the sharp end but  also in the wait for appointments and in providing young people with the kind  of early intervention that can prevent at least some of them from needing more  intense services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Often, that requires a catalyst in the system that can  co-ordinate and enable access for young people, and that needs to be developed and supported at community and family level. We need a focus not simply on  mental health but also on emotional  well-being. Good emotional well-being  and mental health means having the capacity to build positive  relationships and to cope with the ups and downs of life; it means young people  being able to realise their potential and having the opportunity to develop  emotionally and socially. We need to consider the whole of young people&rsquo;s lives  and not just focus on particular disorders or treatments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are proven models. For example, the Mount Sinai Medical  Center in the United States  offers a service that is centred on  the young person: even if young people attend with a physical condition,  they are offered a full review of their mental-health needs. That results in  those needs being addressed quickly and successfully.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a need for both community-run mental-health  services and more specialist tier three medical units to integrate and triage  their provision. We have, at times, two tandem services: GPs refer to child and  family clinics; and social and community services use community-based  mental-health services. For example, community and voluntary organisations used  to be able to refer a young person straight to CAMHS. Now, however, the  pressure on the system is such that no new  referrals are being taken and the community services are having real difficulty in accessing services.  Children using triage need the right service at the right time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that the Minister has just taken up his post and I want to thank him for attending today&rsquo;s  debate. However, I am sure that he will feel the tragedy of the  situation affecting young people and recognise the need for urgent action.  Although the outworking of the Bamford Review will make a difference, its sheer  complexity and volume mean that we could lose sight of the urgent action that  is needed now. Since the Minister is here, I want to ask him some questions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does he agree that there is a need for the following  actions: an urgent review of the anti-depressant drugs that are prescribed to those under the age of 18 to ensure their  safety; the development of a regional service that draws on international best  practice for children and young people at risk of suicide; workforce training  and development for all staff in the health and personal social services and in schools and youth and community  work so that they can be a point of contact for young people at risk of suicide or with mental-health problems?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree  that there is a need to increase the resources available at community  level for early intervention prevention services? Will he agree to look at the  better integration of community and medical services? Will he ask the  Regulation Quality and Improvement  Authority to carry out a review of CAMHS provision at the Knockbracken Healthcare Park?  Will he immediately address the staff shortages that prevent the full functioning of the child and adolescent  inpatient unit at Knockbracken? Will he make funding available for the  development of a full range of services and ensure that it is ring-fenced so  that the funding cannot be used for other services?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also encourage the Minister to consider the development  of a children&rsquo;s task force for areas of high deprivation where children and  young people face severe problems. Organisations such Barnardo&rsquo;s have been  promoting that for some time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have asked the Minister several questions; I hope that if he cannot answer them today, he will read  Hansard tomorrow and get back to me on some of those issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are Members still to speak in this debate who have,  for a long time, championed the rights of children  and young people. I hope that they will support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I beg to move the following amendment: At end insert</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&nbsp;&ldquo;and provide an action plan with a timescale  for implementation.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My amendment calls for an action plan with a timescale and targets for implementation of the  proposals contained in the Bamford Review. Its purpose is to add  sharpness and focus to the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our community is emerging, slowly and painfully, from more  than three decades of intense civil strife. There has been a significant  fallout for our young people as a result of the killing of 3,700 people in our  conflict and the injuries and trauma suffered by more than 30,000 others.  Children and adolescents have either themselves been victims or have watched  our society being brutalised. A breakdown of law, order and family values has  occurred in many areas. We are reaping the whirlwind, and that price will  continue to be paid by the vulnerable in our society, and those vulnerable  young people who, even in a peaceful society, may find it difficult to get a  decent start in life.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Before I entered politics I was employed as a registered  nurse and midwife. I worked in the casualty department of the Mater Infirmorum   Hospital through most of  the Troubles. More recently, however, I worked  for the South and East Belfast Health and Social Services Trust. Its  headquarters are at Knockbracken   Healthcare Park,  which was formerly known as Purdysburn. That word still strikes a chill in the  heart of many people of my generation, who grew up with a feeling of stigmatisation about mental health. As  children, we were warned that we could be sent to Purdysburn.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bamford Review and other reports have, thankfully, shed  some light and fresh air on mental health and have helped to destigmatise it.  However, even in recent times, separate provision has not been available for  children and young people with mental-health issues. Many still have to share  wards with adults, and with psychiatric patients, often with far more serious  conditions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bamford Review made it clear that, because of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s higher levels of social and economic  deprivation, its civil strife and the higher prevalence of psychological  morbidity in adults, the incidence of mental-health disorders in children and  adolescents in Northern Ireland is greater than in the rest of the Unite<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; ">d Kingdom</span>. The Chief Medical Officer for Northern Ireland,  Dr Michael McBride, has reported that more than 20% of our young people suffer  significant mental-health problems before they reach 18 years of age.  That encompasses young people with eating disorders, substance and  alcohol abuse problems, and with developmental difficulties often associated  with mental-health issues. As Sue Ramsey said, it includes those at risk of  suicide and young people who have committed suicide.  We must explore the underlying factors in order to reduce and prevent any more of those awful tragedies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In recent years, there has been a huge increase in cases in  all of those areas, which underlines the urgent need to put an action plan in  place with a timescale and targets. The Bamford Review did an excellent job in  setting out the required actions. Now we must set aside the resources that will  make those actions a reality and in an achievable timescale. I am sure that  some Members know of the problems that are caused when no bed is available for  a young person suffering an acute mental-health crisis. He or she is either not  admitted to hospital at all, or is not admitted to the most appropriate  setting. It is never what is best for that young person.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the trusts are aware of  those problems, and more beds are becoming available.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure that the exact number of beds required has  ever been quantified, but it must be done. The level of provision needed will  become more apparent when other parts of  the strategy, including good mental-health promotion and early intervention within the community, are in place.  When that happens, it will be easier to quantify the exact number of acute beds  required.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">More importantly, as with healthcare in general, prevention  is better than cure. We must get to grips with and tackle the causes of  mental-health problems in young people. Early intervention, at a stage where  the impact of the illness on the young person may be less severe and where  there is a far better chance of early recovery, is necessary. The positive  health agenda must be tailored towards the needs of young people so that more  of them will never have to consider using and abusing alcohol and substances.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many in society are obsessed with celebrity, body image,  competitiveness and consumerism, with the aim of making some people a lot of  money. Many of those obsessions can impact badly on young people &mdash; who perhaps  do not have much self-confidence to begin with &mdash; lowering their self-esteem.  Parents, educators and anyone who is in contact with children need to spend  more time listening to them. That issue will feature in this afternoon&rsquo;s debate  on children who are looked after by the state.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bamford Review mentioned at length the need for professional staff and training in the  education sector, because schools have been found to have been very  effective settings for intervening in aggressive and acting-out behaviours and involving pupils in initiatives to promote  better behaviour. In order for schools to play an effective role, teachers need  greater access to training in the skills and  knowledge necessary to address the mental-health needs of young people,  including fostering good mental health in the classroom and knowing when pupils  need to be referred to more specialised staff.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Where appropriate, mental-health professionals should work  in schools, providing help to individual children who are beginning to show  signs of mental-health difficulties. Those difficulties sometimes arise because  young people are vulnerable, perhaps due to domestic violence, bullying,  parental alcohol and substance abuse, and family separation. Providing  well-delivered services can help young people to develop coping skills. That requires  the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the Department  of Education to work together.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The need for the training and development of the workforce that delivers mental-health services is  covered in detail in the Bamford Report. Qualities such as a positive  attitude and sensitivity must be developed. Although caring for young people  with mental-health problems can be very challenging, it is also very rewarding.  Good working conditions for staff are imperative,  as is appropriate, regular and updated training.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to refer to the rights of the child in relation to  the issue of mental health. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the  Child has been ratified by the UK  Government, and its principles and practices must be the basis of all our actions. The UN Convention gives children the right to the highest attainable  standard of mental-health care that is culturally and medically  appropriate and is provided in a safe environment. Mental-health provision  should not discriminate, but should always be in the best interests of the  child, and the child&rsquo;s view should be respected.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that the Minister is still getting to grips  with the most complex of all Government briefs, of which mental health is a  specialist area. I wish the Minister well in  his term of office, and all Members will wish to be supportive. After  responding to the motion, I hope that he will bring a detailed action plan and appropriate timescales before the Assembly in due  course.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I add my condolences to those already expressed to all families in Northern Ireland  who have suffered the tragedy of a suicide. Suicide knows no barriers, be they  of religion, colour or creed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Most Members agree that the entire area of mental-health  provision is abysmal. A root-and-branch reform to tackle the deficit of  provision across all areas of mental health, including for depression,  anorexia, potential suicide victims, self-harmers or children who are abused  and at risk, is required.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The key theme of the Bamford Report for children and  adolescents is the development of a holistic and integrated mental-health service for children and young people  that crosses organisational and institutional boundaries. Closer partnerships  and better working relationships will be vital if such a vision is to succeed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to take this opportunity to concentrate on the role that collaboration with the education sector  can play in child and adolescent mental health. The Bamford Review&rsquo;s  July 2006 report &mdash; &lsquo;A Vision of a Comprehensive Child and Adolescent Mental  Health Service&rsquo; &mdash; recognised the important  role of the education sector and its  interface with children and young people. It was recommended that the  Department of Education and the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety should aim for greater co-operation in planning and commissioning  services in mental health and education &mdash; even through the establishment of  firm interdepartmental links.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Schools have been found  to be very effective settings for  intervening in aggressive and acting-out behaviours, as was recognised  in the Audit Commission&rsquo;s report &lsquo;Misspent Youth&rsquo;. The crucial contribution  that could be made by people in the education sector &mdash; both in schools and in  youth services &mdash; must be appreciated. Partnerships with other agencies will  enhance the effectiveness of school-based interventions and are to be  encouraged. Practitioners in education need to have greater access to knowledge  and to training in the necessary skills to allow them to address the  mental-health needs of children and young people. Such skills will include the  fostering of positive mental health in the classroom and awareness of when it  is appropriate to refer someone on to more specialised staff.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another recommendation in the Bamford Report was that a  study of the mental-health needs of children in Northern Ireland should be  commissioned as soon as possible;  otherwise, we will not have the most reliable information for the  planning of services. The Hardiker model of four levels of need is used  extensively in the planning of children&rsquo;s services; the Bamford Review proposed  a similar four-tier model. An opportunity exists for health and social services  planners and commissioners to co-ordinate  their services much more effectively. That would encourage the  development of common language across the services in social care, education  and mental health.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It was suggested that the promotion of mental-health services, and the prevention of mental-health  problems, in the school setting should be developed across all schools  to include independent schools&rsquo; counselling services, the health-promoting  school and pastoral-care initiatives. There is a need for educational, health  and mental-health professionals to work in  schools to provide early assistance  for children who are beginning to show evidence of mental-health  difficulties. Independent schools&rsquo;  counselling services provide children and young people with a listening ear and someone to turn to in the school setting. Those services provide accessible  one-to-one support for vulnerable children and young people in coping  with a range of issues including domestic violence,  bullying, parental abuse and family separation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This topic is so vast and wide that five minutes is  insufficient to consider all the problems that we all acknowledge exist within  the mental-health structures. However, when the Committee for Health, Social  Services and Public Safety sits, I would like to think that it will undertake  an in-depth review of the outpourings of the Bamford Review and that it will  hear from the people delivering the services at the coalface about what they  think of the Bamford Review.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: When Members consider how to tackle and treat mental-health  problems, we can see that one of the biggest problems is found in society  itself; and when we remember that the answer to mental-health problems in the  Victorian age was to lock people away, and when we realise that there may be a  patient in Northern Ireland who has spent the past 38 years in an institution,  we begin to realise that the difficulties remain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The existing mindset is  one of the greatest challenges to attempts to change attitudes to mental  health.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those who were involved in the development of the Bamford  Review believe that it lays the foundation for future policy in Northern Ireland.  It is one of the most important policy papers to be produced during the last two decades on the treatment of children and  adolescents. The review recommends not only an aspirational framework,  but a practical set of guidelines that should govern how we assess the success  or failure of the treatment of young and  adolescent mental-health patients. The proposer of the motion painted a  vivid picture of the difficulties that are  experienced by families affected by teenage suicide, which makes one  realise that the time has come for  politicians to take this matter seriously and to do something about it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have undoubtedly inherited a legacy of neglect, but the  Bamford Review shows where we must travel. Now that we have assumed  responsibility for our own affairs, we must strive to make the Bamford Review a  reality, instead of an aspiration. The norm should be individualised,  comprehensive, inclusive services with minimum  restrictions, a family focus, early intervention, a guaranteed  transition between child and adult stages, and a case-management approach. Make  no mistake: that will take time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are major cultural requirements. A widespread understanding of mental disorder is required,  which must include an understanding of the differences among mental  problems, disorders and illnesses; the grades of severity and recurrence among  those states; what constitutes normal and non-normal behaviour; and the importance of environmental factors in the  treatment and diagnosis of problems.  Above all, we need understanding and  tolerance, and an open-minded and positive approach.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mental-health issues recently hit the headlines due to the Muckamore case, on which I do not wish to  dwell. However, that case taught us that there was a problem in the  system. Members must be vigilant and ensure that there are no more hidden  defects.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chief Medical Officer has estimated that one fifth of all young people suffer significant  mental-health problems by their eighteenth birthday. It has also been  estimated that 45,000 children and young people, aged five to 15, suffer from  moderate to severe mental problems, and that 340 of those people should be  hospitalised to some degree.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Of the young people suffering from mental-health problems,  38% are homeless. That brings a new dimension to the problem because history  and statistics have proven that young people who suffer from mental defects  experience a series of mental problems later in life. Furthermore, children with learning disabilities are more  vulnerable to the full range of mental disorders, and it is believed that one  in 10 children indulge in self-harm. It is sobering to think that one in six  people who were killed during the Troubles were under the age of 19. The time has come for Members to take this  matter seriously and do something about it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  As an Alliance Party representative on the all-party group on mental-health  issues, and as an ardent supporter of the recommendations contained in the  excellent Bamford Review, I support the motion and the amendment. Everything  that can be done to improve mental-health provision for children and adolescents in Northern Ireland must be a priority  for the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members have said, the 2006 Bamford Review contains many  recommendations. Paragraph 4.6 states:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Department of Education and DHSSPS should set up  an inter-departmental group to facilitate joined-up planning and commissioning  of services in mental health and education&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">Recommendation 2 states:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;A study of the mental health needs of children in Northern Ireland  should be commissioned as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">That recommendation is based on  paragraph 3.68, which states:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;One of the targets set in the CAMH policy statement  was that a commissioning strategy for delivering services based on identified  need, and meaningful and measurable objectives should be in place by 1 April  2000. While there has been some progress towards a commissioning strategy the  issue of properly identifying need was never addressed.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As has already been said, the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People (NICCY)  has highlighted the importance of the United Nations Convention on the Rights  of the Child, which has 54 articles and was ratified by the UK Government in  1991. Article 27, paragraph 1,  states:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;States Parties recognize the right of every child to  a standard of living adequate for the child&rsquo;s physical, mental, spiritual,  moral and social development.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Government are responsible for assisting  parents and other persons who have responsibility for children to implement  that right. Carmel Hanna referred to that issue in her contribution.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been noted that children who live in deprived areas  are very vulnerable. Save the Children launched the annual child poverty report for 2007, &lsquo;A 2020 Vision: Ending  Child Poverty in Northern    Ireland&rsquo;, in this Building today. It refers  to the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety&rsquo;s &lsquo;Investing for  Health&rsquo; 2006 update, which offers section 75 analysis of suicide and self-harm  in Northern Ireland.  There is much to be gained from reading that report.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members have  referred to the Bamford Review, and I cannot  praise it highly enough. Recommendations 5 and 15 are important on the  issue of child provision in mental-health issues. Recommendation 5 states:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Practitioners in  education must be given training in the necessary skills and knowledge to address children&rsquo;s and  young people&rsquo;s mental health needs, including fostering positive mental  health in the classroom, and referring to  more specialised staff when appropriate.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Recommendation 15 states:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Mental health promotion and prevention in the school  setting should be developed across all schools to include Independent School&rsquo;s  Counselling services, the health promoting school and pastoral care  initiatives.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members had the pleasure of debating the Bamford Review in  the Transitional Assembly. Every party agreed that, when we are in a position  to do so, we should implement the review. The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is still in the  Chamber, and I implore him to implement the review when he has the  opportunity to do so. That implementation will take some time, but we must make  a start and be seen to do that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland needs more professional staff and funding for good mental-health provision. For too  long, mental health has been the Cinderella of the Health Service, a fact that has been acknowledged by  everyone involved in mental-health issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I offer my sympathies to the proposer of the motion, Sue  Ramsey, who has experienced suicide in her area. Throughout Northern Ireland,  we are all affected. In my constituency of  Strangford, there has been a number of suicides.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Am giein ma&rsquo; bakin tae tha ammendement an aa&rsquo; unnerstaun that tha topick is  emoativ an taks in a wied range o&rsquo; issues an proablims.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Tha issue o&rsquo; &ldquo;inpatient caer&rdquo; is sumthin aa&rsquo; wush tae  haylicht especially as it hiss&rsquo; bin broucht tae my attentshun by my constituents twa mony tiems in shokin an sad  waes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">But nae metter aboot  tha different coverin o&rsquo; tha single proablim tha unnerlyin issue still  houls aa&rsquo; disturbinly saem soart o&rsquo; theem &ndash; an that is aa&rsquo; lack o&rsquo; suppoart.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion completely. This emotive topic spans a  wide range of issues and problems. I wish to highlight the issue of in-patient  care, because my constituents have brought  it to my attention in shocking and saddening ways too many times. No  matter how it is cloaked by the individual problems, the underlying issue  retains the disturbingly similar theme of a lack of vital support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to dwell upon  the issue of children with autism, as the lack of time allocated to this  debate prevents me from highlighting all the issues that I would like to. I am  familiar with the scenario of the care of one autistic boy. His parents do  everything for him &mdash; they wash him; dress him; cook for and feed him; they  clean, bath and toilet him; they amuse him; and they hug, kiss and love him. He depends on his parents for his every  need. When he is at school, they do the washing, ironing, cleaning,  shopping and try to find time to work in order to pay the bills. They love  their son with all that they have and all that they are, but, sadly, love is  not enough to get the family through the sheer exhaustion and the emotional and  mental strain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is up to the community and to us as elected  representatives to step up to the plate and help that boy and his parents. We  can do that by supporting them and offering them the best that our society can  to ensure that they do not reach the point of no return.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The major problem with the current system is simply that  there are not enough places available. That is an issue worth highlighting too.  It is estimated that one in 100 children has some degree of autism. That means  that more than one in 100 parents has the additional stress of caring for a  child who needs extra care and attention. Depending on the severity of the  disability, that care can range from helping with a few extra hours of homework  to doing everything for the child for the whole of his or her lifespan, which  is likely to be just as long and healthy as anyone else&rsquo;s.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For example, I know one family with an autistic son and two  young daughters. The mother, who gave up her job to care for the family as best  as she could, applied for respite care to enable her to take a break and spend  time with her other children. She was put on an emergency waiting list, but,  two years later, she still has not had a weekend off. For three hours a week, a  trained professional provides care for her son to allow her to spend time with  her daughters, but that is the sum of her relief.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">She has sought help from all the organisations and  charities, such as Home-Start, and they have tried to help. However, the crux  of the matter is that the volunteers are  not trained to deal with her troubled son. Autism is a severely misunderstood condition, and only trained  professionals with patience and understanding know how to deal with autistic  children. Even those who are trained can find the work a strain, due to the  unpredictable nature of the disability.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There will not be enough resources to deal with the  ever-increasing numbers of children suffering from autism. The Welsh Assembly has found that the number of children diagnosed with autism in Wales has  increased by 124%. I might table a question to the Minister concerning  the figures for Northern    Ireland, because I believe that there has  been an equal increase here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no long-term plan in place; there is insufficient  funding, and, therefore, there is no hope for the parents and the children. To  be forewarned is to be forearmed. The number of children with autism is rising,  and we sense the effect that that is having on society and on individuals. I  cited two examples of families in my area who are suffering. We must stand up  for those people and develop a plan so that we and the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety can do everything possible to help.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">These families are not  asking for much. They are not asking for more than they are entitled to.  We are being asked to give them only what  they need and what we can provide,  which is support. I therefore support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  Mr Deputy Speaker, I congratulate you on  your elevation to high office. I know that you are very capable of carrying out the duties of your  new post.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I share the concerns of  those who have already spoken in this debate. The current poor state of  the child and adolescent mental-health service is unacceptable in twenty-first  century Northern Ireland.  The lack of trained staff to run mental-health services, coupled with the lack  of child and adolescent inpatient beds, is appalling. I accept that no single  agency can deal with these problems on its own, but as a matter of urgency I  call on the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to meet with  the various agencies with an interest in this in a bid to resolve this crisis  while, at the same time, keeping within the recommendations of the Bamford  Review.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some months ago, I  attended a school in Dungannon for the education of mentally handicapped  children and adolescents. On my arrival, I met a young lady with triplets of  seven- or eight-months-old, one of whom was mentally handicapped. She handed me  the child, which I held in my arms. I knew  what the child required in terms of funding and support methods. Yet  when the child&rsquo;s mother asked me about funding and support, I could only state  what was currently on offer, and it was pitiful, to say the least, that I had  to tell her that there was little or no help available. I vowed that day that  if ever I got into a position where I could help in the area of mental health,  I would do my utmost.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This situation is untenable. We must never forget that we  are talking about human beings, and we are obliged to note that we, as elected  representatives, have the ability to help as the terms of reference of the  Bamford Review state:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to recognise, preserve, promote and enhance the  personal dignity of those with mental health needs&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At some time in their lives, one in four people will be  affected by mental illness, which is the equivalent of 27 Members out of the  108 in this House. That is a shocking statistic. Carers of those with  mental-health needs must not be forgotten &mdash; they continue to play a key role in  caring for those in our society with mental illness. Carers and their work are  often forgotten. If we are to solve these problems, carers should be afforded  the right to make an input, as they have the experience and understand what needs to be done. We must  provide immediate solutions that are imaginative, practical, even  radical, cutting right to the heart of the matter and meeting the needs of all  those with mental illness. This can only be  achieved with collaboration and co-operation with all relevant  stakeholders, from both inside and outside the health and social services  sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The solution must, in all ways and at all times, reflect  the needs of the children and adolescents with mental illness.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety  (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: It was said  earlier that this is a very complex  issue, and that is no exaggeration. First of all, I put on record that I  am committed to improving the mental-health services for children and  adolescents. It is essential that our children and young people receive  mental-health services that meet their needs, and that is why I intend to  implement the recommendations of the Bamford Review for children and young  people. Indeed, I accept all of those recommendations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members are aware,  the full report of the Bamford Review is due to be published this  summer. However, the section dealing with children and adolescents was  published last July, and some of its recommendations have already been implemented. It is clear that prevention will be the key element in improving services for  children and adolescents. Indeed, the Bamford Review revealed the  staggering statistic that more than 20% of young people could have significant  mental-health problems by their eighteenth birthday. It estimates that 45,000  children and adolescents in Northern    Ireland, aged between 5 and 15, could have a  moderate to severe mental-health disorder that requires intervention from  specialist child and adolescent mental-health services. The estimates also  suggest that around 340 children and adolescents need inpatient services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those statistics give some indication of the size of the  challenge that we face. Of course, mental health has been the Health Service&rsquo;s  Cinderella service since time immemorial; indeed, Bob Coulter talked about the  Victorian approach of locking people away in their hospital beds. However, we  have moved slowly away from that culture.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The statistics highlight the extent of the problem that our  young people face, and they also make clear the need for all of us to take  sustained and determined action. After all, children are our future, and if  people are our biggest asset, then children are of utmost importance. They are  our responsibility. We want to prevent young people from suffering as a result  of mental-ill health, and we want to promote good mental-health by providing  accessible and effective treatment services.  We can do that by developing a comprehensive and high-quality range of  services, from early intervention right  through to specialist inpatient treatment. If we have effective services  upstream when young people first face  mental-health problems, we can reduce the  risk of those young people&rsquo;s  developing more serious problems that require inpatient hospital  treatments at a later date.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members may be  aware that the post of director of mental  health and learning disability, the establishment of which was a key  recommendation of the Bamford Review and which was announced in March last  year, has now been advertised twice. Although interviews were held in March, we  have been unable to appoint anyone to the post. In order to avoid any further  delay, I have made the key decision to not advertise the post nationally and regionally again but to appoint  immediately a board of experts who  will advise ministerial colleagues and me about the implementation of  the Bamford Review. That board will fulfil the role of the director.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members are aware, mental health and learning  disabilities are two distinct streams, and this board can act as a champion for  both streams &mdash; a new mental health and learning disability board to give  greater impetus to the Bamford agenda. The Bamford Review will finally deliver  in full this summer. The role of the board will be to challenge my Department  and others who provide these vital services to some of our most vulnerable.  Until the post is filled, Bamford will not be driven forward seriously enough.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that that step  will go some way towards meeting  some of Carmel Hanna&rsquo;s concerns about implementing an action plan. The board  will drive the process and will challenge  my Department. Having a body of experts to advise me on mental-health  issues reflects the fact that we are making a priority of this issue, and it  shows clearly that it is a complex and diverse subject that needs urgent  attention.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The new arrangement will ensure that innovative thinking  and different perspectives will be brought to bear on many issues. I have asked  officials to let me have proposals on how we will put this in place, and I  expect to see that work completed quickly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is no secret that  there have been, and continue to be, difficulties in the local statutory  provision of specialist mental-health facilities for children and young people.  Sue Ramsey made the point that there are difficulties in accessing appropriate  treatment and that when inpatient treatment is necessary, the shortage of beds  has been a problem. Currently, there are 15 available beds for young people up  to and including the age of 13 in the child and family centre, and eight beds  in the interim unit at Knockbracken.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members know, there have been major problems at  Knockbracken, not least of which was that it took until 2006 to recruit a  replacement for the consultant who was suspended in 2004. At one stage, when  one unit was closed down as a result of that suspension and another had been  burned in an arson attack, there were no beds available for adolescents. That  major shortage of beds is being rectified, but not quickly enough. By the  summer, 12 additional beds will bring the total number available to 27.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the health  and social care trusts are taking steps to deal with recruitment  difficulties. Highly specialised skills are  required, and the trusts are striving to bring staff levels in the units  up to the necessary levels. It is often a question not of finding beds but of  sourcing the staff to man them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Progress is also being made on two new specialist  mental-health facilities at Forster   Green Hospital,  for which significant investment plans are in place. The one for adolescents,  costing around &pound;5 million, will replace the existing facilities and provide 18  beds. The second facility will replace the current child and family unit and  will have an important educational facility and a specialist psychiatric  hospital for children. It will also replace  an existing 15-bed unit, giving an anticipated total of 33 beds by 2009, which is well within the range  suggested in the Bamford report. However, the report also stated that the  number of beds should be reduced and that ways should be sought to deal with  mental health conditions outside the hospital environment, with inpatient care  as a last resort. The conclusion of the reassessment was that 33 beds would be  sufficient for the community service infrastructure, and that is the situation  as is stands. I accept that it is not wholly satisfactory, but the focus is on  early interventions to reach children with mental-health  problems at the earliest stage, and the recruitment of staff with  appropriate skills will be crucial in achieving that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No one can deny that mental-health services for children  and adolescents have suffered from chronic underinvestment. That must change.  Significant funds are being, and must continue to be, invested. New money has  come from the children and young people funding package, and another key factor  to come out of the Bamford Review was the establishment of crisis intervention  teams.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To some extent, that relates to the point that was made  about urgent intervention and action to prevent suicides. One such team is already in place in the Eastern Board  area and encompasses several skills. The first of the crisis intervention teams, which will have the ability to treat patients immediately or involve other  specialists as necessary, will be  operating by June 2007. It is hoped to  increase the number of teams to one per board in order to provide  immediate intervention, help and referrals.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those proposals do not provide all of the answers, but they  show that steps are being taken and that the situation is being addressed.  Crisis intervention teams will assist in providing appropriate, timely clinical  intervention for young people, with the aim  of preventing patients&rsquo; problems from developing into more serious  conditions. In some cases, they will remove the need for inpatient admissions.  Around &pound;500,000 is being channelled into  the crisis intervention teams for 2006-07, and a further &pound;1 million will  be invested in the following year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although there have been some difficulties in recruiting  staff, the boards have used in-year funding to improve other services to  children and young people with mental-health problems; for instance, waiting lists  have been addressed. Waiting lists are too long, but I am told that they have  been halved in the past two and a half years. At that time, over 1,000 young  people were awaiting a first appointment, but that number has been reduced by  half. The waiting lists remain too long and are unacceptable, but progress has  been made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Robinson mentioned the important role that schools have  in promoting mental-health services. Additional  money has been provided from the Department of Education, through the  children and young people&rsquo;s fund, to provide counselling support to pupils so  that problems are identified and dealt with as early as possible. Funding of &pound;750,000 was provided for 2006-07, and &pound;1&middot;8  million is being invested in 2007-08. That investment has enabled all  post-primary schools to have access to counselling. I share Members&rsquo; concerns about the need to do more to develop those  services, and I will ensure that those issues are urgently responded to  and treated as priorities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members know, the Bamford Review has a major resource  implication. Total funding for mental health in Northern Ireland is around &pound;175  million per annum. The Bamford Review conservatively estimated that that figure  needs to be doubled. The additional funding will not be granted in one year,  because the required staff skills are not available, but that is the level of  resource implication involved. However, we must make provision for those funds.  We are doing approximately half of what needs to be done, and our efforts need  to be literally doubled.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I accept the Bamford Review and its recommend-ations. I  share the concerns of the proposers of the motion, and of the amendment, and  the other Members who have spoken. I will seek to ensure that the Department  performs appropriately and shows urgency in  dealing with the issues that have been brought before the House. I have  stated some of the measures that are being brought forward, but there is still  much to do.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>: All parties in the Transitional Assembly welcomed the  publication and recommendations of the Bamford Review, and we all shared the  dismay of mental-health practitioners, sufferers and their carers at the  failure of direct-rule Ministers to give any additional financial resources to  implement the recommendations. I thank the Minister for attending the debate.  Such a show of support already shows the dividends of a devolved Assembly.  Across Northern Ireland,  there are high expectations that the devolved Assembly will listen to, and act  in the best interests of, the people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members talked about the conflict and its impact on  the mental health and well-being of our children  and young people, as did the Bamford Review. It is unfortunate that  neither the First Minister nor the Deputy First Minister was able to secure any  additional funding for a peace dividend to look at the emotional, psychological  and physical needs of our children and young people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has no difficulty with the content of the motion,  but we were concerned that, similar to the Bamford Review, it did not set out a  clear action plan with detailed objectives to be achieved within a reasonable  time frame. The Bamford Review on child and  adolescent mental health services contains a number of recommendations  that do not necessarily require additional funding, but rather new ways of  working.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We heard the Minister referring to the unfortunate failure to have the new director in place in  March 2007. However, I welcome his commitment to having a panel of  experts. My only plea is that they should be real and true advocates and not be  tied to a trust, Department or board for any source of funding &mdash; they should be  true advocates for the people who are suffering.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bamford Report sets out a four-tier approach to working  together, and we have heard many Members speaking about the need for  collaboration between the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Services and the Department of Education. Indeed, the Minister has also given a  commitment to having more coherent working  in his Department, as regards health and social services personnel, as well as interdepartmentally.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Levels of deprivation are much higher in Northern Ireland,  and there is also poverty. One Member mentioned the launch of the new report  from Save the Children, the fact that 100,000 children are living in poverty in  Northern Ireland  and the impact that that has on their mental, emotional and psychological  well-being. However, the report also refers to funding deficits, and the  Minister has said that we are only half way towards getting the funding that is  needed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members highlighted personal experiences and have  spoken well about the people they have known as friends, neighbours and  children who took their lives because of poor mental health and, perhaps, other  factors. Everyone in the Chamber can relate to someone who has taken his or her  life, and it is unfortunate that services were not there at the point of need,  and that not enough beds were available. I welcome  the fact that the Minister has said that additional beds will be made available. However, as he  rightly said, there will still not be nearly enough.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Specialist beds are required for different conditions.  Members talked about the particular needs of carers &mdash; for example, those who  care for people with autism and other learning disabilities. Although there is  a need for inpatient services and treatment  intervention, respite for carers is needed also. When the Minister is  looking at the provision of services, I trust that he will look across the  whole of Northern Ireland  and, in particular, to the region west of the Bann. Parents who may have other  children, and other caring responsibilities, should not have to trek across to Belfast on a regular  basis to visit their children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister outlined clearly a number of actions that he  is already taking. In fairness, and given that the Health Service is complex,  he does seem to be hitting the ground running, and I congratulate him.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, perhaps he will confirm that one of the key  recommendations of the Bamford Report was that a study of the mental-health needs of children in Northern Ireland should be commissioned. That is long overdue, and  indeed some work and a report were to have been completed by 2000. Planning to  meet needs must start from a baseline, and I ask the Minister to ensure that commissioning  that study will be one of the key actions he will take on board quickly.  I trust that he will report progress to the Assembly at the earliest  opportunity, and well within the year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms </strong><strong><span style="font-size:10.0pt; ">N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</span></strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am delighted to hear the Minister&rsquo;s remarks about  the Bamford Report, and that he accepts the report in its entirety. That is very welcome.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Every Member who spoke in the debate has pointed out the  lack of attention that has been given to services for children and young people. There has certainly been a lack  of coherent planning and investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our higher levels of deprivation have also been mentioned, and the legacy of 30 years of political  conflict on mental health and emotional well-being has not yet been  fully realised. Child and adolescent mental health services are wholly inadequate and have resulted in some of the  cases that Sue Ramsey mentioned earlier. The difficulty  is that young people and their families wait for months and sometimes  years for appropriate treatment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have learned that young people are now being transported  to England  for treatment, with no regard being given to the social disconnection and  distress that that causes them and their families.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the practical and technical difficulties that the Minister outlined about securing staff and  resources, the fact must not be  ignored that that is a flagrant abuse of the rights of children and  young people under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The Assembly must ensure that everything that can be done will be done. It must  invest heavily in mental health services for children and young people to  ensure that that culture does not continue.  Financial investment is needed, and many young people need  individualised care. Pathways will evolve through the integrated provision of  services that includes the Youth Justice Agency and other agencies from the  education, community and voluntary sectors.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I accept the points  that were raised by other Members, who acknowledged the role of the  education sector at the interface with children and young people. That has been  widely recognised. The Bamford Review recommends that the Department of  Education and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  should set up an interdepartmental group to facilitate and collaborate in that  field. That group must be established as soon as possible. The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety must contact the Minister of  Education on the matter forthwith.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much has been said in the debate, all of which is welcome.  Members are encouraged by the Minister&rsquo;s prioritisation of mental health for  all and, in particular, for children and young people. I support the motion and  the amendment. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, <span style="font-style:normal; ">That the  amendment be made</span>, put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses  concern at the current state of child and adolescent mental health services,  particularly the lack of child and adolescent in-patient beds and dearth of  trained staff to run these services; and further calls on the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety to take urgent action to address this  situation in keeping with the Bamford Review and provide an action plan with a  timescale for implementation.</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Care Matters Strategy</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has allowed  one and a half hours for the debate. The Member who proposes the motion will have 10 minutes to speak, with 10  minutes allowed for the winding-up speech. One amendment has been received and  is published on the Marshalled List. The Member who proposes the amendment will  have 10 minutes to speak, with five minutes allowed for the winding-up speech.  All other Members will have five minutes to speak.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls  upon the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to set out his  plans to improve the outcomes for children &ldquo;looked after&rdquo; by the state and for  the implementation and resourcing of the Care Matters Strategy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I applaud the  Business Committee for accepting this important motion. It gives the Assembly  the chance to throw a spotlight on a vulnerable and needy group of children,  particularly when Members consider the subject of the previous debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have no difficulty in accepting the amendment, and I want  to thank its proposers. I agree that the issues that affect children and young  people cut across several Departments. It is important that the Executive  prioritise those issues. That would send out a strong, clear message that  children and young people are important in the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is crucial that the  debate takes place in the Assembly because it allows locally elected  Members to deal with the issues that affect children and young people and to  take actions that will make a difference. I thank the Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety for his attendance. I hope that he is not  fatigued after attending three debates back to back. I hope that he will listen  to my questions and return to me with the answers if he does not have them  today.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Paul Goggins recently launched &lsquo;Care Matters in Northern Ireland  &mdash; A Bridge to a Better Future&rsquo;. I am conscious that the Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety is being asked to respond to a policy  document to which he had no input, but, based on his last speech, he will be  influential in determining its success or failure. I know that the Minister  shares my view that this issue demands to be prioritised as much as acute hospital services, trolley waits and  prescription charges, which we debated earlier.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Children who require state care are among the most  vulnerable in society, and, as evidenced in other places, their life chances  are not the same as those for children who have not been in care. Key  statistics that are recognised by the Department of Health Social Services and  Public Safety show that only one in 10 school leavers who have been in care  achieve five or more GCSEs at grade A to C, compared with three in five for  school leavers who have not been in care; children who have been in care are 10  times more likely to leave school without any qualifications; looked-after  children aged 10 and over are 10 times more likely to be cautioned or convicted  for a criminal offence; care leavers are six times more likely to be unemployed  than school leavers who have not been in care; and more than 25% of women who  have been in care become pregnant before their twentieth birthday.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, there is great cause for concern, and it is fair  to say that the current situation does not offer much hope for the 2,500  children who are currently in the care system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Research and consultation with young people who have  experienced care paints a picture of instability, insecurity and, often,  isolation. Frequent placement and school  moves, ever-changing professional input and a lack of support to deal  with the traumatic experiences of their childhoods have all been voiced as key  issues by that group of young people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is against that backdrop that my party welcomes the consultation paper, &lsquo;Care Matters in Northern Ireland  &ndash; A Bridge to a Better Future&rsquo;, that the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety published in March. It goes beyond the Westminster Green  Paper, &lsquo;Care Matters&rsquo;, and sets out a  challenging vision of how Members might improve the outcomes for  children in care and, more importantly, for those who are on the fringes of  needing care and their parents.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The document was  produced by various Government Departments  and has proposals that transcend children&rsquo;s pathways through the care  system. The proposals also dovetail with forthcoming legislation and policy on  adoption and with the Children (Leaving Care) Act (Northern Ireland) 2002, which was  passed by the previous Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The consultation document considers how family support measures for children on the edge of care  could be improved and makes radical proposals to restructure social services to facilitate early intervention,  therapeutic support and new ways to work with families. The document also makes interesting proposals for  specialist foster parents, with links to residential units, and for lead individuals to ensure improved health and  education outcomes for children in  care. For looked-after children, there are useful proposals that are  designed to ensure that they have the best opportunities while in care and  during outside activities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The document seeks to improve safeguards for looked-after  children through innovative proposals to reform the independent visitor role  and to ensure that the new health and social services trusts and trust boards  exercise corporate responsibility. That is particularly welcome. In addition,  there are proposals to enhance opportunities for children in school and further  education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that the document is subject to consultation  and that that will limit what the Minister can  say and the commitments that he can make. However, &lsquo;Care Matters in Northern Ireland  &ndash; A Bridge to a Better Future&rsquo; is innovative and challenging and has been well  received. Members will be glad to know that it is not controversial. Although  many of the proposals can be implemented without resources, others require  funding. I seek assurances from the Minister and wish to hear his Department&rsquo;s  thinking on how outcomes for those children will be taken forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Before doing that, I  wish to put down a marker about the funding of family and childcare  services in general. During the last debate, the Minister for Health, Social  Services and Public Safety said that the mental-health service was a Cinderella  service. I go further, and say that services for children and young people are  the Cinderella services of the Department. Therefore, I ask that the Minister  gives an assurance that the funding for childcare services will not be cut back  and that additional money will be provided.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For some time, it has  been documented and accepted that spending on family and childcare  services in Northern Ireland  has been low in comparison to the average figure in England.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Recently published figures from the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety for the year 2004-05 put average personal and  social services spending per capita at &pound;287 in the North, compared to &pound;402 in  England &mdash; a large gap that features year after year in previous comparisons.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy  Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The considerable investment in the children&rsquo;s fund and,  more lately, in the children and young people&rsquo;s funding package has been  extremely welcome, but we are seeking to implement policies such as Care  Matters from an unacceptably low baseline.  That matter has been recognised by the Children&rsquo;s Commissioner, and Sinn  F&eacute;in looks forward to receiving a copy of the research on funding of family and  children&rsquo;s services by the Department of Finance and Personnel and NICCY. Hopefully, that will underline the need for  investment in Care Matters and other  services to families and children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that work should begin on the  implementation of that agenda, particularly now that proposals do not require  funding? Will he seek to appoint a task force to advance those proposals?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the creation of five new super-trusts &mdash; one with  22,000 staff &mdash; will the Minister also assure the House that boards will  exercise their responsibility for corporate  parenting as a matter of priority? Is the Minister prepared to write to the chief executives and  chairpersons of the five new trusts to emphasise that point?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am conscious that I have only a few minutes. I have a  number of questions for the Minister, and I will write to him if need be.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister advise the Health Committee on  developments at the end of the consultation period at the earliest opportunity? Will he confirm that he intends to  ensure that the measures included in the family support strategy &mdash; which are  important because of their relevance to Care Matters &mdash; are funded from the  children and young people&rsquo;s funding package? Will the Minister confirm that the recently announced &pound;4 million for  family support will continue beyond 2007-08?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Care Matters consultation paper is silent on the issue  of funding. How will the Department resource the strategy, and what is its  estimation of the cost of the full  implementation of the proposal? Will the Minister offer a guarantee  that, within the Programme for Government and funding bids for his Department,  he will ensure that this strategy gets a high priority?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister showed great enthusiasm during his speech, but  the Assembly has formed similar strategies in the past. I thank the Minister  for his interest in this matter, and I will  listen carefully to his response. I hope that we will soon be able to demonstrate much-improved outcomes  for children and young people, particularly those  in care, and I hope that the consultation document and this debate act  as a bridge to a better future.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  beg to move the following amendment: Insert after &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;encourages the Northern Ireland Executive to make  the protection of vulnerable members of society one of its key  objectives, and&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been said that a society can be judged by how it  treats its most vulnerable. Going by Northern Ireland statistics, that  is not very well, particularly in relation to looked-after children. Positive  outcomes for that group have been unacceptably low. Protecting the most  vulnerable members of society should be a prime focus for the new Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some 9% of looked-after children of school age were  suspended from school in 2002-03, compared to 1&middot;7%  of the total school population of Northern Ireland. A further 1&middot;7% of school-age children were  expelled in 2002-03 &mdash; slightly higher than the figure for the same group in  England, which was 1&middot;1%, and much higher than the rate among the total school  population in Northern Ireland. Some 22% of the 1,263 school-age children who are looked after by local trusts in Northern Ireland at 30 September 2003 had a statement of special  educational needs, compared with 27% of the same group in England, and 4% of the total school population  in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proportion of care-leavers achieving five or more GCSEs  at grades A to C compares very badly at 11% with that of all Northern Ireland  school-leavers, 59% of whom attain such grades.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Care-leavers in Northern Ireland are in general 10  times more likely than school-leavers to leave care without gaining any  qualifications. Indeed, 51% of all care-leavers  left care without gaining any qualifications, compared to 5% of all Northern Ireland  school-leavers. Only 11% of young people left care having gained five or more  GCSEs at grades A to C, and a further 26% left  with one to four GCSEs, grades A to C, in 2002-03.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some 57% of the care-leavers whose economic activities were  known were involved in education, training or employment. That compares poorly  to the figure of 91% for all 16-18 year olds in Northern Ireland. Ten per cent of  the 986 looked-after children aged 10 and over in Northern Ireland were  cautioned or convicted in 2002 and 2003, compared to 10% of looked-after  children in England and 1% of all children in Northern Ireland. Of those who  were convicted, nearly 66% &mdash; almost two thirds &mdash; were boys.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The &lsquo;Care Matters&rsquo; strategy is an innovative and  far-reaching document that goes beyond its English equivalent. The estimated  costs of implementing its recommendations are in the region of &pound;30 million to  &pound;40 million over three years. That seems to be an enormous sum, but it must be weighed against improving  children&rsquo;s lives and achieving better outcomes where reducing pregnancies and  improving mental health and social functioning are concerned. It is argued that  many of the proposals will not require any funding; rather, political will and  leadership from the DHSSPS and other Government bodies will be necessary. Given  that the Department has not committed to resourcing the strategy, I do not  understand why it has included it in its bids. I look forward to hearing what  the Minister has to say about the subject.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Members who moved the motion. I can speak on the subject with some  personal knowledge, as I am a registered foster carer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the enormity of the situation, few people have a good  understanding of it. There are 2,436 looked-after children, 53% of whom have  been looked after for more than three years. Administrators of social services  must ask the key question: what is best for the children? We should all should  identify with that. However, I question a system that keeps children in care  for many years without their being adopted to make them a permanent part of a  family.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Most children are  fortunate enough to have significant adults in their lives: parents,  family members and teachers. All act as mentors and role models, and,  occasionally, advocates. Not every child is fortunate enough to develop those  relationships, but every child in care should be facilitated so that they can  have that type of mentor. Not only will that person offer befriending, support  and advice to young people, he or she will do so from a position of  independence from the care system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that social services in England and Wales have a duty to provide an  independent visitor for every child in care who has had little contact with  their birth parents. Those visitors are often volunteers who offer a  befriending service for children who have infrequent contact with their  parents. The visitors&rsquo; role is set out in The Children (Northern Ireland)  Order 1995 and regulations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The potential to develop that role goes beyond children&rsquo;s  contact with their parents. Children could be provided with an independent  source of advice and encouragement, and, where a child wishes, advocacy.  Research on children in care has shown how much they value the role of the independent  visitor. It is vital that all children experience stability and permanence in their family. Those factors facilitate positive  attachments and resilience and provide the basis for a transition to  independent living and adulthood.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Most children are provided with a stable family life by the  family into which they are born. However, we need to be proactive in supporting  children without immediate family or wider  networks by finding families to provide consistent care for them. Where  children cannot be adequately cared for, it is imperative that the authorities  move swiftly to restore their sense of permanence, security and normality by  giving them an alternative family environment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Thankfully, for many children care is a positive  experience. Foster carers and staff in residential units devote a lot of energy  and commitment to the children whom they look after. However, we know that some  children in care have a different experience. Sadly, too many find themselves  in placements that do not meet their needs. In 2002-03, over 20% of all  children who had been looked after for more  than a year had changed placement at least once. Fourteen per cent had  changed placement only once, 3% twice, and 4% three times or more. We know that the lack of permanence and  stability in the lives of children and young people in care can  contribute to poor educational attainment, low-self esteem, and disruptive and challenging behaviour, leading some of  them into conflict with the law.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In Government documents, we often see pleasant phrases such as &ldquo;child centred planning  approaches&rdquo; or:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;tools such as lifestyles planning, mapping and  pathways&rdquo; .</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let me be clear: none of those things can compare with the  real love and stability of a permanent home and family. Many children remain in  care throughout their childhood up until the age of 17 or 18, at which stage  they need to become self-reliant. I make a plea for Government officials to  become more proactive.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  welcome this strategy. It proposes many radical changes that are long overdue.  The strategy sets out a comprehensive and holistic package of proposals  addressing the problems that children in care in Northern Ireland may suffer from.  We have many children who are not in school, who have mental health problems,  who have alcohol or drug problems, or who are teenage parents or young  offenders. Put simply, that is unacceptable and needs to change.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The strategy has sound principles: family support, partnership  and a multidisciplinary approach. The underpinning vision of the strategy is to  reduce the number of children and young people in care by 20% and to improve  outcomes for young people in care, so that we at least double the proportion of  care-leavers who are in employment, education or training at age 19. Yet, while targets are important, we must  remember that sometimes a care placement is the best place for certain  children at certain points in their lives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland, there is a lack of high-quality  foster and residential carers &mdash; that is not to take away from the excellent  carers that we do have, but we need to encourage more people to take on this  demanding but extremely worthwhile role. Being a carer is a very challenging task and it is something that requires  support. Proper, up-to-date training needs to be provided for carers &mdash;  training in communication, in managing bad behaviour  and, indeed, in encouraging and nurturing the young people and showing them affection. Improvements in training  for residential carers and in the general standards of care homes are long  overdue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is important research on the value of kinship and  keeping siblings together, but, again, the proper support, training, financial  support and monitoring need to be in place.  The strategy outlines the importance of care plans for children who are  in care. I believe that the role and purpose of the care plans need to be  clarified and made more user-friendly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the children are involved. The issue  of advocacy has already been mentioned and it is certainly addressed in the  consultation document as well. A good example of children&rsquo;s advocacy, VOYPIC &mdash;  the voice of young people in care &mdash; is mentioned. That should be developed  further.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Questions of implementation and resourcing are rightly  highlighted in the motion, and they need to be addressed to bring this strategy  forward. At all times the child&rsquo;s needs must be put first, and confidentiality for the child is paramount. Many social care  professionals working on the ground with children in care have expressed their concerns that confidentiality of  the child&rsquo;s private life is essential if their trust is to be retained.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The strategy also emphasises the need for specialist  training for professionals in the field. Social care workers, health  professionals and professionals in the education and library boards require  proper training in how to deal confidentially with the complex needs of  children in care.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A key message in the  Care Matters strategy is early intervention. That is particularly  important for children who are at the edge of care. Early intervention can pay  off. Sometimes the resources will have to be redirected to preventative  services so that social care provision can focus on this rather than crisis  management.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Education is also addressed in the strategy. Health is  mentioned too, although I would like there to have been more focus on this,  especially on mental health. I am very  supportive of the objectives of the strategy; namely, to improve the  outcomes for children in care &mdash; children who are the most vulnerable in our  society. Lastly, evidence suggests that insufficient joined-up working has caused some of the barriers to improvements  across relevant authorities &mdash; both  statutory and voluntary. There now exists an opportunity for a fresh  start.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Care Matters strategy, which aims to improve outcomes for  children, is a vitally important part of what this Government is about. If the  Government exist to do anything for people in our society, it must be to  protect and defend the weakest and most vulnerable members of that society.  Therefore, it is absolutely imperative that these measures are adopted and  taken forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The whole process needs to be much more streamlined. For  example, the average time from care to an adoption order was three years and 10  months during 2003-04; a wholly unacceptable delay in a child&rsquo;s life.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much of the Government policy actually works against, and  prevents, the spirit of the idea of placing children permanently with families  as early in their lives as possible. Many children in care are moved in excess  of 12 times in the first six years of their lives. There needs to be an  immediate overhaul, not only of the social services procedure but of the legal  process, to streamline bureaucracy and red tape in order to place these young  children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I know from my discussions with my Friend and party colleague, the new Minister, how vitally  important he accepts his role to be in this respect. He wants to get in  and actually break this cycle of school expulsions, low academic achievement,  unemployment, unplanned pregnancy and low self-esteem; and to replace  hopelessness, and in some cases real individual human tragedy, with a sense of  hope.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I have no difficulty in supporting the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  It could be said that there is a general assumption that when children are  taken into care, their lives are back on track and that they have, in a way,  been rescued. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is only the  beginning of the story.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my own constituency,  it is evident that in the case of older children, the same problematic behaviour displayed  in their natural home is still very  prominent in their care facility &mdash;  be it a statutory place of care or a foster home.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is easier to assume that there could be something of a  strain within them that naturally gives rise to their bad behaviour,  non-compliance and their generally obvious  talent for antisocial behaviour. However, the sad fact is that long before these children reached  the clutches of our social services, many of them lived a life of fear  in an environment filled with disrespect, poverty and general misguidance.  Others arrived there, perhaps, through poor parental health or marital  problems. They are simply visitors to the system and manage to leave relatively  unscathed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Surely the main aim of our care system should be to attempt  to repair whatever damage has been done and help instil the care and respect  that these children have been denied, in order to help redirect their lives and  nurture a positive experience while they are in care. Unfortunately, this is  not the case in many instances, and the experience becomes one that is fraught  with difficulties, misconceptions and general failure &mdash; failure by those  charged with the caring role to care in the true sense of the word. The stigma  attached to being in care can be a huge barrier to a child&rsquo;s well-being and  self-image.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to do more to improve the very heart and soul of  care. The effects of the review of public administration (RPA) &mdash; which could  for a time destabilise and structurally challenge many statutory bodies charged with delivering the very core of  looked-after services &mdash; will have a huge impact on how those  improvements to care can be achieved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many looked-after  children&rsquo;s lives have been marked by uncertainty and disrespect, and  many have been largely ignored, with their  feelings and opinions undervalued for years. Is it any wonder that they  do not know how to communicate with  anything other than defensiveness? Their  entire mental and physical being must be convinced that they have worth and that, more importantly,  someone cares enough to allow them to  establish a firm foundation that they can build upon to form an approach  to adulthood that will benefit them and  those around them. In a fast-changing world, we need long-term solutions  &mdash; not quick fixes and then a hop, skip and  jump onto the next casualty of life.  Positive, sustained and valuable  support after the rescue is vital.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The transition from  childhood to adulthood is a rocky road for those making the journey with  the support of their family. So, a child in the care system needs to get  information and advice such as that education is important and parenthood is no  bed of roses. The latter is a hard and thankless task in many instances. Good  mental and physical health is essential and the wisdom to know when to ask for  help is vital, something that the young people themselves identified. They want  to know when the time is right for them to ask for help. Those are only a few  of life&rsquo;s lessons that every child needs to learn &ndash; and learn before he finds  himself sitting in the middle of all the difficulties trying hard to climb back  out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many of our young people leaving, or who have just left,  the care system find themselves in those situations almost immediately. Teenage  parenthood is the most common scenario for those either in care or just leaving  it. It is my fervent hope, as a mother and a grandmother, that the pending  strategy will make a difference to the lives of those thousands either in the  system or teetering on the edge of it. Furthermore, I hope that the Minister  charged with the responsibility of Health, Social Services and Public Safety will  take the opportunity to ensure that it is  properly implemented in conjunction with all the relevant statutory  bodies so that it will be effective in real time and not effective in one area  and totally non-existent in others. A holistic approach is our only hope to  give vital help to those who need it and to show them that this will not be a  piecemeal approach but a real and honest attempt to give them back their  self-respect, while teaching them how to live a safe, peaceful and happier life  than, perhaps, they were used to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Minister, I wish you well in the job that you have  undertaken. It will not be an easy one. I hope that you will see that this strategy is one that will be very effective  for the good of all our young people.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim mo bhu&iacute;ochas leat as  an deis labhartha a thabhairt domh ar an cheist th&aacute;bhachtach seo na bp&aacute;ist&iacute; at&aacute;  faoi ch&uacute;ram altramais. &Oacute;s rud &eacute; gurb &eacute; seo an ch&eacute;ad uair domh ag labhairt agus  t&uacute; f&eacute;in sa Chathaoir, d&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas leat as ucht do cheapach&aacute;in chuig  ard-oifig LeasCheann Comhairle agus gu&iacute;m gach rath ort sa todhcha&iacute;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; suim ar leith agam sa cheist seo ar dh&aacute; &aacute;bhar: sa ch&eacute;ad  dul s&iacute;os, is m&uacute;inteoir scoile m&eacute;; agus sa dara c&aacute;s, is tuismitheoir altramais  m&eacute;. Ar an d&aacute; &aacute;bhar sin, t&aacute; suim ar leith agam sa cheist seo.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have a special  interest in this issue, as I am a teacher and a registered foster carer.  Looked-after children are among the most vulnerable pupils in the education  system, as other Members have said, and they need, deserve and have the right to the best possible education that  our system can provide.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately our education system has not served those  children well, and there is much room for improvement. I support the view that  our approach to the education of looked-after children must be firmly child centered, and that home, school, social  services and out-of-school activities should work in a co-ordinated way  to ensure the maximum emotional, physical and intellectual growth of those  young people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that many looked-after children are doing  extremely well in the education system, and I welcome that very much. However, I am deeply concerned that at the other end of the scale there are young people  who feel, and, indeed, are, alienated from the education system. It is  also a cause for concern that looked-after children are more likely to underachieve  and underperform, and are disproportionately represented in statistics for  expulsion, suspension and poor attendance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the key elements in supporting looked-after children  is ensuring that they have permanence in home and school placement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The fostering achievement scheme, which is unique in the UK, has  benefited from the children and young people&rsquo;s fund. The scheme has been  effective in supporting young people in ways that enhance their educational development, improve their  self-confidence and esteem, and help them in tackling basic difficulties  in literacy and numeracy. It is important  that the scheme should be expanded to include younger children and young  people leaving care.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I referred to permanence  earlier, and the system should endeavour  to ensure that young people have permanence in the future. Where  appropriate, fostering should become adoption, as was mentioned by Mary  Bradley.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The fostering achievement scheme has helped to empower foster carers to become educational  advocates for the children in their care. Statistics show that many  foster carers are, like myself, in the 40 to 60 age range &mdash; and I will not  reveal to which end of the scale I am closest. Many foster carers are no longer  au fait with the changes in the education  system since they attended school. The teaching of the basics in  education has changed so much, and fosters  carers must be kept abreast of those  changes if they are to support fully the children. They must be made  aware of curriculum changes at primary and post-primary level if they are to be  the strongest possible advocates for the education of children in their care.  If foster carers are familiar with the education system, they will know better  what they can do to help and support those children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When foster carers are supported to engage with schools as  strong advocates for their children, as other parents do, the children can only  benefit.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I hope that in future, the fostering and achievement scheme will be expanded as  I have outlined, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have been very lenient on time, as this is a very serious  subject.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: It is only right  that children should be a key priority for the Executive. That was touched on  in the previous debate. People are our greatest asset, and children are a key  part of that. My Department has special responsibility for 2,500 children in care and 1,600 children on the child  protection register. I am particularly aware, therefore, of the duty  that we have to meet the needs of children and young people, many of whom also  have difficulties or mental health problems.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have a statutory responsibility to children and young  people through our laws, and also through our commitments to international  standards such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Our  special responsibility to children in care requires that we should strive to  provide the best possible care. Our expectations for them should be the same as  they are for our own children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to see young people sitting at the heart of the  Executive&rsquo;s wider programmes to tackle the problems faced by the most  vulnerable groups in our society, including  the children, young people and families whose needs the Care Matters  strategy is designed to meet.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Outcomes for children in care are often poor in comparison  to their peers. Sue Ramsey said that they are one of the most vulnerable groups  in society; she has never spoken a truer word. Such young people, who often do  not have their mothers and fathers to defend them or speak for them and do not  have their wider family group to look after them, are the most vulnerable among  the vulnerable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Common problems include poor educational attainment,  conflict with the law, high likelihood of being the victim of a crime, low  self-esteem, poor job prospects, greater risk of mental health problems,  uncertainty about the future and numerous placements in foster care or children&rsquo;s homes. Recently, one agency told me about an eight-year-old who had had 41  placements in his short life. The instability that that creates for a  child is horrendous.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to develop new approaches in order to dramatically  improve the lives and outcomes of this particularly vulnerable group. An  imminent joint report will highlight the fact that children&rsquo;s services in Northern Ireland have been underfunded,  historically, in comparison with Great Britain.  That issue will inform this debate, and I call on all Members to support  me in ensuring that the disparity in funding is addressed as a matter of  urgency. We need to provide necessary and sustained investment, right across  Government, to support Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s most vulnerable children and  families.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Through Care Matters we have a unique opportunity to tackle  these issues at every level. The document outlines a radical new approach to  developing and enhancing services with a view to improving the lives of  looked-after children. This is the start of a process that will significantly  improve services for children in care. I will do all that I can to ensure that  we deliver the best possible services for vulnerable children and young people  in Northern Ireland.  The Care Matters strategy provides us with a very positive starting point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are three key pillars of Care Matters: first, to prevent children from coming into care by  improving family support services;  secondly, to improve the quality of life in the residential care or  foster care setting; and, thirdly, to prepare children to leave care. One of  the problems that we have seen is that children leave care at 18. The average  age for children leaving home in Northern Ireland is 22, but this  most vulnerable group are on their own at 18.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is one example of  the problems that the strategy must  address. It will make a real difference to all children in care, who are  entitled to the same opportunities in life as children with parents.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The strategy sets out a number of ambitious goals,  including reducing the number of children and young people in care by 20% from  around 2,500 to 2,000, and increasing the proportion of care leavers who are in  education, employment or training at age 19 to at least 80%. Again, the numbers are tragically low in that area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the Care Matters strategy was launched in March it  received widespread support and endorsement from key local stakeholders,  including Barnardo&rsquo;s, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to  Children (NSPCC) and Children in Northern Ireland (CiNI). By working  in partnership with such groups, we can deliver a strategy that will work and  that will, ultimately, improve the lives of children in care.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposals are centred on six main areas: strengthening  support to families and children at risk of being taken into care while  ensuring that children are properly protected; ensuring that children who come  into care are in the right placement and have stable placements, be that in  foster care or children&rsquo;s homes; ensuring that the new trusts have the  necessary arrangements in place to act as corporate parents for children in  care; improving education opportunities for children in care; providing  children in care with opportunities to take part in activities outside school  and care; and strengthening support to young people leaving care, as they make  the transition to adulthood.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sue Ramsey was assiduous in asking me questions, but she  will have to put them in writing because I caught only a few of them. Some &pound;4  million has been set aside for family support, but that is for 2007-08 only,  and further funding will have to be bid for as part of the comprehensive  spending review process in order to mainstream the funding beyond March 2008.  The comprehensive spending review provides us with opportunities under a  three-year budget and Programme for Government, but a commitment has to be  included in the spending review otherwise the opportunity will be lost.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was asked about corporate parenting, and that is included  in the six key areas identified in the proposals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was also asked about the adoption strategy, &lsquo;Adopting the  Future&rsquo;. It has been consulted upon and new legislation will be brought  forward. Funding is needed to improve the adoption services, including  post-adoption support services. The new adoption strategy will make it easier to place prospective adoptees with  adopters more quickly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are some of the points that were raised, but I did  not catch all of them. Members will have to write to me with any other questions, and I will happily reply or talk  to them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Care Matters strategy is very much the start of the process. It is an excellent illustration of  departmental collaboration. This is  not just a matter for the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety; it concerns other  Departments, too. It involves the Department of Education and the Department  for Employment and Learning, working closely with staff in the trusts, the  education service, careers service and further and higher education  establishments to improve outcomes for children in care.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The document has been published for consultation to start  discussions on issues that affect children in care. As part of this  consultation process, we are arranging, in partnership with the voluntary  sector, specific events targeted at children and young people to ensure that we  maximise their opportunity to have their say. It is not simply a matter of  adults discussing the future of children in care; it is vital that we listen to  and learn from their experiences. When we have considered all the views of the  stakeholders, we will be able to finalise this important policy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was asked about the funding implications of the Care  Matters strategy. As with all funding matters, funding for the strategy will be  considered by the Department and a bid will  be submitted to the Executive as part of the Programme for Government  and comprehensive spending review considerations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The holistic approach outlined in the document requires the  support of a number of Departments, and I hope that I will be able to enjoy the  full support of my colleagues in taking it forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have listened with interest to the views expressed here  today. The Care Matters strategy contains proposals designed to deliver  long-term fundamental reform of services for children in care, and it is  essential that we get it right. They are one of the most vulnerable groups in  society and they have been sadly neglected over generations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dealing with their problems, and the issues and challenges  involved, is vital. If that does not happen then the cycle will be  self-perpetuating. That will be tragic because every instance represents one  young life &mdash; and every single life is precious. That is why the Care Matters  strategy is so important.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I am happy to give the winding-up speech on the amendment. Bringing the motion  and the amendment together will cement what we are all here to achieve for the  people we represent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Statistics on children who are coming out of care are very  scary. Those young people, who are in care through no fault of their own, are  six times more likely to experience a teenage pregnancy; 10 times more likely  to leave education with no qualifications, and are less likely to carry on to  full-time education than other children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The questions are: why are those awful statistics happening  in what is supposed to be a modern country; why are children leaving care at  the age of 18 to go on the dole and not into training or employment; why are  they less likely to involve themselves in community activities such as sport  and drama, and how can the failures that have been permitted for so long be  justified? The answer to the final question is that those failures cannot be  justified.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Changes can be made through taking small yet significant  steps, and it is up to Members to begin the process by ensuring that the  reforms set out in the Care Matters strategy are implemented fully and as soon  as possible. We must at least double the number  of children in care who carry on to higher education. They are just as  capable as other children, given the opportunity, but they have not had the  same encouragement as those from more suitable and satisfactory home lives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Considering that up to 10% of children in care have had 10  different social workers during their time in care, it is easy to see how any  encouragement to stay at school carries little weight with them. Those children  have not had the chance to bond with, or develop a respect for, the person who has been working with them before  that person has been moved on. There must be continuity of care to enable  workers to get to know the children and gain their respect so that in  conversations about the future, each child feels that the person they are  talking to understands their capabilities, whether it be attending university  or doing a plumbing course. Such encouragement would form a large part in  getting past the mentality of worthlessness  that is, unfortunately, so prevalent to those in care at present.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Up to 40% of children are in inappropriate care &mdash; that must  change as a matter of urgency. In addition, a large part of the problem is that  children leave care at the age of 18, and, as the Minister said, other children  normally remain at home until the age of 22 and are encouraged to do the right  thing, to get that job and perhaps, promotion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that children coming out of care are left to get  on with their lives at the age of 18 cannot continue &mdash; a future-care programme  must be established. I welcome that the  Minister has responded positively, and Members will be monitoring his  progress on the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Care Matters  strategy is worthy because it means that steps will be taken to ensure  that the statistics highlighted will never  again be seen in Northern Ireland and that funding will ensure that  there is a high level of accountability throughout the system. Members must  remember that these are not simply statistics, they represent the lives of the  children of our Province who have done nothing wrong and who deserve a better  start to their adult lives than the current abandonment that they are faced  with at present.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed team must be asked to: track the progress of  looked-after children in education; deal with all referrals of looked-after  children with regard to concerns about attendance; prepare, maintain and  monitor the implementation of the personal education plan for each looked-after  child; liaise with the child&rsquo;s school and provide training for social services,  foster carers, staff in residential settings and school staff.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Training and support must be developed for foster carers,  whom I admire. They deserve credit for what they do, and training and materials  must be there to help equip them. The benefits of training must be actively  marketed. Foster carers and key workers need more training in child  development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members have  spoken of the need for everyone to work together. A child&rsquo;s personalised  education plan must include input from foster carers and key workers as well as  the assigned member of the looked-after children team. The policy of extending  alternative education placements beyond the compulsory school-leaving age,  particularly for young people in care, should be considered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Care Matters offers a comprehensive package for improving  outcomes for children in care. It will not be easy for the Assembly, but we  must take the first tentative steps towards ensuring that improvements in those  children&rsquo;s daily lives actually take place.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. As we have heard, Care Matters  sets out a framework in which we can adapt and enhance the rights of children  in care or on the verge of going into care. Care Matters is an excellent  framework for action, and though we all have some reservations &mdash; I particularly  share those outlined by Sue Ramsey &mdash; we want Care Matters to be a live strategy  with clear, time-bound, costed actions as soon as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As cited in the 2006  children&rsquo;s strategy by the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy  First Minister, the Assembly has committed  itself to the overarching goals that children and young people should be  healthy, have opportunities to learn and achieve, and live in safety and with  stability. They should have experience of economic and environmental well-being  and live in a society that respects their rights.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sadly, as we have heard, for too many children this is not  the case. Only today Save the Children has launched  a report, which says that 100,000 children are living in poverty in the  North. It is important that we give children and young people the support and  care that they need to reach their full potential. To hear of one child being  placed 41 times is nothing short of horrendous. Children and young people in  care are being looked after by the state; they must want for nothing. Those  children deserve the best-quality care, delivered by highly trained  professionals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There should be no equivocation about this. There should be no corner-cutting or arguments about  budgets. As Sue Ramsey and other  Members have said, the Care Matters strategy has been passed to the  Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety, and we ask him to  fast-track the implementation of its recommendations. As has already  been said, that will require cross-departmental actions, as well as investment.  We will raise these and some other issues with the relevant Departments and with businesses both North and  South. We need the assistance of  agencies such as the Children&rsquo;s Law Centre and other youth justice organisations  in order to implement the Care Matters strategy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must ensure that not  just some, but all the children of  the nation are cherished equally. I support the motion and the  amendment. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Question</em>, That the amendment be made, <em>put and  agreed to</em>.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly  encourages the Northern Ireland Executive to make the protection of vulnerable  members of society one of its key  objectives, and calls upon the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety to set out his plans to improve the outcomes for children &ldquo;looked  after&rdquo; by the state and for the implementation and resourcing of the Care  Matters Strategy.</p>
