              earnáileach i mBaile Átha Cliath Dé Céadaoin 27 Feabhra 2002.
              Bhí gnóthaí a bhain le cur chun cinn shábháilteacht bia agus
              le comhoibriú ar cheisteanna sláinte faoi chaibidil ag an
              chruinniú.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ndiaidh domh féin agus don Uasal James
              Leslie, Aire sóisearach in Oifig an Chéad-Aire agus an
              LeasChéad-Aire, bheith ainmnithe ag an Chéad-Aire agus ag an

              le chéile den cheathrú huair mar chruinniú den Earnáil
              Sábháilteachta Bia agus den Earnáil Sláinte. Bhí an tUasal

              James Leslie, á thabhairt ar a shon chomh maith.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fuair an Chomhairle tuarascáil chuimsitheach
              ar an dul chun cinn i riarachán agus in obair an Bhoird um Chur
              Chun Cinn Sábháilteachta Bia.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thug an Chomhairle dá haire dul chun cinn an

              á chur faoi bhráid na Comhairle lena cheadú ag an chéad

              Sábháilteachta Bia don bhliain 1999-2000. Thug an Chomhairle dá

              naisc idir saotharlanna a fhorbairt agus comhaltachtaí taighde a
              dhámhachtain. Cheadaigh an Chomhairle go gceapfaí beirt bhall
              bhreise ar an Choiste Chomhairleach Eolaíochta agus go nglacfaí
              leis na scálaí leasaithe tuarastail don chéad ghrúpa de 20
              ball foirne a fostaíodh.</p>

              dul chun cinn i ngach ceann de na cúig réimse comhoibrithe san
              earnáil sláinte. I measc na dtosaíochtaí a aimsíodh le
              haghaidh comhoibriú bhí seirbhísí taismí agus éigeandála,
              pleanáil le haghaidh olléigeandálaí, comhoibriú ar threalamh
              ardteicneolaíochta, taighde ar ailse, agus cur chun cinn sláinte.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sa réimse seirbhísí taismí agus
              éigeandálaí, thacaigh an Chomhairle leis an chomhoibriú

              mhaoirsiú ag Grúpa na Seirbhísí Ospidéal Réigiúnach Thuaidh/Theas.
              Thug an Chomhairle dá haire fosta an comhoibriú ar conas
              seirbhísí trasphlandála orgán a fhorbairt ar bhonn
              uile-oileáin; tá sé beartaithe ag na feidhmeannaigh faoi seach
              eolas a mhalartú le linn dóibh seirbhísí duán a
              athbhreithniú sa Tuaisceart agus sa Deisceart.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sa réimse pleanáil le haghaidh
              olléigeandálaí thacaigh an Chomhairle leis an dul chun cinn go
              dtí seo i bhforbairt clár de chúrsaí pleanála trasteorann le
              haghaidh éigeandálaí, freagairtí comhpháirteacha ar thaismí
              bóthair agus an dul chun cinn i gcuid nithe eile. Thacaigh an
              Chomhairle fosta leis na réimsí breise oibre a d’aimsigh
              meithleacha a bhí ag obair ar nithe eile ar nós prótacail

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maidir le comhoibriú i ngnóthaí

              scéim iniúchta fisice radaiteiripe Thuaidh/Theas le comhoibriú
              a chur chun cinn idir ionaid radaiteiripe sa Tuaisceart agus sa
              Deisceart. Thug an Chomhairle dá haire fosta go bhfuiltear ag
              forbairt creata ar bhonn leanúnach le measúnú a dhéanamh ar
              fheidhmiú tomagrafaíochta astaithe posatrón ar bhonn
              uile-oileáin agus go bhfuil ceardlann/seimineár faoi na
              forbairtí is déanaí san ardteicneolaíocht á heagrú ag an
              ghrúpa comhpháirteach um theicneolaíocht sláinte.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thug an Chomhairle dá haire go bhfuiltear ag
              leanúint den chomhoibriú sa taighde ar ailse mar chuid den
              chomhaontú trípháirteach a chuimsíonn an Institiúid
              Náisiúnta Ailse sna Stáit Aontaithe Mheiriceá agus na Ranna
              Sláinte sa Tuaisceart agus sa Deisceart. Thug an Chomhairle dá
              haire go háirithe an obair atá ar siúl ag grúpa na gclárlann
              comhthaighde agus é ag leagan amach tosaíochtaí le haghaidh
              taighde comhoibritheach agus ag caighdeánú bhailiú sonraí.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I dtaca le cur chun cinn sláinte, thug an
              Chomhairle dá haire an dul chun cinn go dtí seo i dtionscnaimh
              éagsúla a ceapadh leis an tsláinte a chur chun cinn. Orthu sin
              bhí meastóireacht ar an fheachtas faoi aigéad fólach,
              tionscnaimh in éadan chaitheamh tobac, tionscnamh faoi chothú,
              agus tionscnamh uile-oileáin le sláinte san áit oibre a
              fhorbairt.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">D’aontaigh an Chomhairle go mbeadh an chéad
              chruinniú eile san fhoirm earnáileach seo aici sa Tuaisceart i
              mí an Mheithimh 2002.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">D’aontaigh an Chomhairle ar théacs na
              teachtaireachta a eisíodh i ndiaidh an chruinnithe. Cuireadh
              cóip den teachtaireacht i Leabharlann an Tionóil.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to report to the Assembly on the meeting
              of the North/South Ministerial Council held in sectoral format in
              Dublin on Wednesday 27 February 2002. The meeting considered
              matters relating to food safety promotion and co-operation on
              health issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following nomination by the First Minister and
              the Deputy First Minister, Mr James Leslie, junior Minister in the
              Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, and I
              attended the fourth meeting of the Council in the food safety and
              health sectors. Mr Micheál Martin, the Minister responsible for
              the Department of Health and Children, and his colleague Dr Thomas
              Moffatt, Minister of State with responsibility for food safety and
              older people in the Department, represented the Irish Government.
              This statement has been approved by Mr James Leslie and is also
              made on his behalf.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council received a comprehensive progress
              report on the administration and work of the Food Safety Promotion
              Board (FSPB). The Council noted the board’s progress on the
              preparation of a three-year multi-annual plan, which will be
              submitted for approval to the next Council meeting in June, and
              the FSPB’s annual report and accounts for 1999-2000.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council also noted progress in several
              other areas, including the development of laboratory linkages and
              the awarding of research fellowships. It approved the appointment
              of an additional two members to the scientific advisory committee
              and revised remuneration scales for the initial tranche of 20
              staff.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council received a presentation from
              officials in the Department of Health and Children on the
              development of the health strategy, ‘Quality and Fairness – A
              Health System for You’, which was launched last November.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council received further reports on
              progress made in each of the five areas of co-operation in health.
              The priorities identified for co-operation include accident and
              emergency services, planning for major emergencies,
              high-technology equipment, cancer research and health promotion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to accident and emergency services,
              the Council endorsed the continuing cross-border hospital
              co-operation overseen by the North/South regional hospital
              services group. It also noted co-operation on assessing the
              potential for the development of organ transplantation services on
              an all-Ireland basis, and that respective officials plan to
              exchange information during the reviews of renal services, North
              and South.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council endorsed the progress to date on
              the development of a programme of cross-border emergency planning
              courses, joint responses to road traffic accidents and several
              other matters. It also endorsed further areas of work identified
              by the working groups on issues such as communication protocols.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to co-operation on high technology,
              it approved a proposal to establish a North/South radiotherapy
              physics audit scheme to develop collaboration between the
              respective radiotherapy centres. It also noted that a framework
              for assessing the operation of positron emission tomography on an
              all-island basis is still being developed and that a joint
              workshop seminar on emerging high- technology development is being
              organised by the joint health technology group.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted ongoing co-operation on
              cancer research as part of the tripartite agreement, which
              includes the National Cancer Institute in the USA and the Health
              Departments, North and South. In particular, it also noted the
              work carried out by the joint research registries group on the
              setting out of priorities for collaborative research and the
              standardisation of data collection.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to health promotion, the Council
              noted progress to date on a range of health promotion initiatives,
              including the evaluation of the folic acid campaign, anti-smoking
              initiatives, nutrition and the development of an all-island
              workplace health initiative.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed that its next meeting in
              these sectoral formats would take place in the North in June 2002.
              It agreed the text of the communiqué issued following the
              meeting, and a copy of that has been placed in the Library.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety (Dr Hendron): </b>I welcome the
              Minister’s positive statement. I was particularly interested to
              hear about the co-operation on accident and emergency and cancer
              services. The Committee’s recent report on cancer services in
              Northern Ireland highlighted the need for further investment. The
              co-operation on cancer research under the tripartite agreement<b>
              with Dublin, Belfast and Washington is important for attracting
              the best cancer specialists and maintaining </b>the world-leading
              cancer research currently being undertaken in Belfast. The
              co-operation between the ambulance<b> services is welcome, and the
              Assembly will have a debate on the Ambulance Service later today.</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the framework for assessing the
              operation of positron emission tomography (PET) on an all-Ireland
              basis? The Minister played a significant role in getting high
              technology into the Royal Victoria Hospital, although it will take
              some time to establish.</p>
              <b>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his welcome to the
              statement, which strikes a positive note on ongoing work. The
              framework for assessing the operation of PET technology on an
              all-island basis is in development. People are familiar with CAT
              (computer-assisted testing) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
              scans. PET technology is a major new development in medical
              imaging, and I want to see everyone benefiting from advances in
              modern technology, particularly imaging. I am content that the
              joint health technology group should examine the feasibility of
              PET technology. The development of PET clinical scanning services
              is a highly appropriate area for North/South co-operation.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister tell the House what precise
              mutual benefit there is in the development of an all-island
              workplace health initiative? It is not clear to me what that would
              be.</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that the Member’s Colleague Sir Reg
              Empey expressed his willingness to have an all- island initiative,
              he will be able to give the Member even more detail on the matter
              than I can.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to health promotion, it has been
              found that considerable savings can be made in economies of scale
              in ventures such as the folic acid public awareness campaign and
              other television campaigns. Rather than reinventing the wheel in
              two different parts of the island, we can co-operate by using work
              that has already been developed in one area and, therefore, share
              the cost. One area bears the cost of developing the awareness
              campaigns, and the other contributes to, or pays for, the cost of
              television advertising. That has been useful. In progressing such
              work, some people may be further forward than others. That allows
              us to learn about, and share, best practice. All those aspects
              will be progressed in the discussions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, Members will be aware that
              consideration is being given to the appointment of dedicated
              programme managers for the Health Promotion Agency in the North
              and the Health Promotion Unit in the South. That will progress the
              work programme on an all-island basis. The work being done here by
              the ministerial group on public health, and the work being
              undertaken by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment
              on the occupational health forum, will feed into the
              considerations on the work being undertaken on workplace health on
              an all-island basis.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I too
              welcome the Minister’s statement. I wish to return to a point
              made by the Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety. Given that cancer services were
              debated in the House last week, and that today the situation
              facing the Ambulance Service will be debated, can the Minister
              tell the House how those two areas of co-operation are being
              developed? In addition, can the Minister update the House on the
              validation of qualifications for health professionals on the
              island, which was also the subject of a debate in the House?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If I do not answer all the Member’s questions
              now, I will write to her.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to cancer services, the Department
              has established links with the National Cancer Institute in the
              United States and the Department of Health and Children in Dublin
              to create a cancer consortium. The North/South Ministerial Council
              allows for ministerial oversight of the work that is being
              progressed through those arrangements. The arrangements afford
              world-class links to our research community, and the enthusiastic
              involvement of the National Cancer Institute is in part a response
              to the quality of the research that is already being carried out
              here. Through the consortium, the research and development office
              here has secured two jointly funded three-year epidemiology
              fellowships, which are linked to the Belfast and Southern cancer
              registries.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The close co-operation and collaboration of the
              registries will, for the first time, make data available on the
              incidence of cancer throughout the island of Ireland. The
              consortium is also fostering an exchange programme among the three
              partners, as well as a major clinical trials initiative. That will
              enable cancer patients throughout the island of Ireland to
              participate in clinical trials. The consortium also allows us to
              take part in international conferences. One such conference will
              take place in the Royal Victoria Hospital in October 2002.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The feasibility study on the all-island
              helicopter service has been jointly commissioned, and a report is
              expected in June 2002.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Work is also being undertaken on the response
              to road traffic accidents. That will include work on ambulance and
              hospital services in border areas to ensure maximum co-operation
              to the benefit of all patients in those areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am afraid I have forgotten the final point.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome co-operation in all areas of food
              safety and health. The Minister may have already answered my
              question about accident and emergency services. Members have
              mentioned the provision of an all-Ireland air ambulance, and the
              Minister has just mentioned it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the excellent co-operation and
              businesslike manner in which the North/South meetings have taken
              place be able to continue, given the unnecessary, offensive and
              stupid remarks about our cross-border neighbours made by David
              Trimble at the weekend?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not clear that the second question related
              much to the Minister’s statement, but the Minister may wish to
              respond to the first question.</p>

              costs and benefits of an all-Ireland helicopter emergency medical
              service (HEMS) was placed in national newspapers, North and South,
              during the week ending 26 January 2002. Fifteen tenders have been
              received, and they will be evaluated. The aim is for the
              evaluation exercise to start in mid-March, and it will be
              completed by the end of June 2002.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The North/South Ministerial Council has
              overcome barriers and difficulties to date, and I am sure that it

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That the Second Stage of the Health and
              Personal Social Services Bill (NIA 6/01) be agreed.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The aim of this short Bill is twofold. First,
              it will provide for nursing care to be free in all settings by
              extending free nursing care to people in nursing homes. This
              important step will, with the Assembly’s consent, make the
              funding of long-term care fairer.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From October 2002, nursing home residents will
              be treated in the same way as those who are cared for in their own
              homes. Any nursing care that they require will be provided
              according to need and free at the point of delivery, not on the
              basis of ability to pay.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the Bill will enable the
              establishment of a new local body — the Northern Ireland
              Practice and Education Council for Nursing and Midwifery (NIPEC)
              — to support the professional development of nursing and
              midwifery. Over 20,000 registered nurses and an estimated 5,000
              support staff play a vital role in the delivery of health and
              social care to people here. They work in a wide variety of roles
              and care settings, including the voluntary and independent
              sectors. The aim of the profession, working in a constantly
              changing healthcare environment, is to strive to provide
              consistent, high-quality care that is updated and developed for
              the benefit of patients and service users. To achieve this goal,
              it is essential to have structures in place that support the
              profession, particularly in the key areas of best practice,
              continuing education and lifelong learning, and excellence in
              performance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the debate on care for the elderly on 27
              February 2001, I provided an overview of how England, Wales and
              Scotland had separately responded to the report of the Royal
              Commission on Long Term Care for the Elderly, and I gave an
              indication of my intentions in this regard. More recently, in the
              debate on 21 January 2002 on care in the community, I was able to
              report progress on a range of significant initiatives that I have
              taken over the past year. I remarked on the interim findings of
              the community care review, on work undertaken by my Department on
              carers, and on the imminent introduction of legislation to help
              support carers better.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also anticipated the legislation that would
              be needed to transfer residents with income support preserved
              rights to care management by health and personal social services
              in April 2002, together with the resources to fund their care.
              Furthermore, next month I will introduce a three- month disregard
              on the value of a resident’s former home when he or she
              permanently enters a care home. I referred to this proposal in the
              debate on 27 February 2001. These changes to the charging rules
              for residential and nursing home care are evidence of my
              commitment to making long-term care for older people more
              responsive to individual circumstances and fairer for anyone who
              needs continuing help and support from health and personal social
              services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health and social services were given priority
              in the Budget statement of Monday 3 December 2001 on the Executive’s
              revised allocation proposals for 2002-03. This will enable the
              Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to tackle
              some of the current serious problems in the community and hospital
              sectors. Additional funding will be allocated to community care in
              the next financial year. In particular, £4·5 million will be
              provided for the introduction of free nursing care from October
              2002, subject to the successful passage of the Bill.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is estimated that there are approximately
              2,000 residents currently paying the full cost, or most of the
              cost, of nursing home care. Those residents will benefit initially
              from the introduction of free nursing care. In order to qualify,
              residents will be required to have an appropriate assessment of
              their nursing care needs. The assessment process will be fair and
              easy to understand, and will involve the minimum of bureaucracy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I asked the chief nursing officer to set up a
              group to advise me on an appropriate assessment process. This
              group of health professionals is involved in the development of an
              assessment tool, which will be ready by October 2002. The
              development process will include the preparation of associated
              guidance for, and the training of, nurse assessors to carry out
              assessments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the measures required to provide
              free nursing care, the Bill will provide that the cost of time
              spent by a registered nurse in giving nursing care to residents of
              care homes will not be subject to charges for that care. Nursing
              care, for this purpose, is tightly defined as</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;any services provided by a [registered]
              nurse … and involving —</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a) the provision of care, or</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b) the planning, supervision or delegation of
              the provision of care,</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">other than services which … do not need to be
              provided by a nurse so registered&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, from next October the cost of
              nursing care will be removed from the nursing home residents means
              test. The means test will then apply only to personal care costs
              and accommodation costs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Members resolved, at the end of the debate
              on care for the elderly on 27 February 2001, that the Executive
              should implement the recommendations of the Royal Commission on
              Long Term Care for the Elderly in full, they laid particular
              emphasis on the provision of free personal care.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I brought the Assembly’s resolution to the
              attention of the Executive on 3 May 2001. The Executive decided
              that an interdepartmental group should be established to examine
              the costs and implications of introducing free personal care here,
              drawing on the findings of the Scottish care development group.
              That interdepartmental group has been established, and its work is
              continuing. It is to report its findings to the Executive by the
              end of June 2002. The Executive will then consider if free
              personal care is affordable and if it should be implemented here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now turn to the proposed creation of the
              Northern Ireland Practice and Education Council for Nursing and
              Midwifery (NIPEC). Although individual organisations that deliver
              healthcare will support the development of their own nursing and
              midwifery staff, the creation of the new body will facilitate a
              much needed mechanism to develop consistency in the standards for
              achieving best practice, education and performance in nursing and
              midwifery. The new local body will also be able to support the
              work of the new four-country nursing and midwifery regulatory body
              — the Nursing and Midwifery Council — and will work locally on
              its behalf.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, NIPEC will work alongside other
              local professional bodies to take forward multi-professional
              initiatives. In the development of the proposals for the
              establishment of NIPEC, a consultation paper was issued in August
              2000 to a wide range of individuals, groups and organisations.
              Responses to the consultation, and subsequent meetings held with a
              range of stakeholders, indicated broad support for the proposals,
              particularly from the profession locally.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The establishment of the new body is an
              important step forward for the largest group of staff within
              health and social services. NIPEC will make a significant
              contribution to the development of nursing and midwifery,
              ultimately improving the quality of care provided for patients in
              hospitals and for service users in the community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill provides for a body corporate to be
              known as the Northern Ireland Practice and Education Council for
              Nursing and Midwifery, which shall have the duty to promote high
              standards of practice among nurses and midwives and in their
              education and training. It shall also promote the professional
              development of nurses and midwives. A schedule to the Bill
              provides for the proper governance and control of the new body.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will have points to raise, and I will
              try to answer as many as I can when winding up the debate. If I
              cannot respond to a particular matter today, I will write to the
              Member concerned.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety (Dr&nbsp;Hendron): </b>I welcome
              the introduction of the Health and Personal Social Services Bill.
              The Bill has two provisions, the first of which covers free
              nursing care, as the Minister stated. The other provision covers
              the establishment of the Northern Ireland Practice and Education
              Council for Nursing and Midwifery (NIPEC).</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have learnt that the Bill will provide for
              free nursing care for elderly people who live in nursing homes.
              The measure will cost approximately £9 million each year. The
              introduction of the measure has been deferred to the end of
              October 2002 due to lack of money in the Department’s budget
              allocation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Currently the cost of nursing care for
              residents of a nursing home is included in the cost of their place
              in that home. If they are treated as residents of a nursing home,
              they may have to pay for their care. If the community nursing
              service treats them in their own home, or if they are treated in
              hospital, their care will be supplied free. That raises the
              question of equity of treatment, an aspect that the Minister has
              sought to address in the Bill. Residents of nursing homes who are
              in need of care and their families will welcome the revision.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety will wish to explore the provision during its
              deliberations in the Committee Stage. Members will consider how it
              compares with similar action being taken in England, Scotland and
              Wales.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other provision contained in the Bill
              establishes NIPEC. I welcome any measure that supports the
              effective professional development of nurses, midwives and health
              visitors, and improves the quality of care provided to patients by
              those professionals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I am concerned that the proposal will
              create a new non-departmental public body in addition to the
              Nursing and Midwifery Council, due to come into existence in
              April. Members of the Committee for Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety will be interested to hear from the Department on
              the rationale for the new body. The Committee looks forward to
              considering the provisions of the Bill during the Committee Stage.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will try to be as brief as possible — even
              briefer than the Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Bill. I also welcome the
              opportunity that the Committee will have to discuss it in greater
              detail. However, I have one or two concerns about the issues,
              which I hope will be addressed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although every Member of the Assembly welcomes
              free nursing care, there were concerns some months ago regarding
              homes in England. Some of them were abusing free nursing care and
              were taking part of the money. It was not being properly
              distributed and was not, therefore, going directly to the people
              who needed it. Although I am not suggesting that that would happen
              in homes in Northern Ireland, I have some concerns. What action
              does the Department intend to take to ensure that that problem
              does not arise here?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Free nursing care for the elderly is welcome.
              However, there are major concerns that nursing homes are grossly
              underfunded. I am aware that an extra £3·5 million is being
              provided for nursing homes in this year’s Budget. However, that
              must run alongside free nursing care. It is all right to provide
              free nursing care, but if nursing homes across the Province are
              closing, that is a matter of grave concern. What is the Department’s
              long-term strategy for dealing with the gross underfunding of
              nursing homes? I welcome the Bill, and I look forward to examining
              it closely in the Committee.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Like
              other Members, I will also attempt to be brief. I welcome the
              vision of the Bill and the commitment of the Minister. I commend
              the Minister for taking the Assembly’s arguments back to the
              Executive on the need to introduce free nursing care. Members are
              aware that that is a start. I appeal to the Minister to take the
              argument to the Executive that there is a need to look at the
              provision of free personal care for the elderly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to sound negative. A start has
              been made, and we are on the right road. I also welcome the idea
              of setting up the new body for nurses and midwives. However, I,
              like the Committee Chairperson, look forward to the detailed
              scrutiny of the Bill by the Committee. I commend the Bill to the
              Assembly.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the Minister’s statement. Free
              nursing care for the elderly is an issue that I am familiar with,
              and I have wanted to see it brought to a successful conclusion.
              Some time ago, Mr Nigel Dodds and I brought the issue to the Floor
              of the House. We had the unanimous support of the Assembly at that
              time. This morning’s statement represents real progress. It is a
              positive aspect of having a local Administration and a local
              Minister to make decisions. No doubt the Assembly will have to
              study the ins and outs of the provision in detail.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the fact that a group has been
              set up to examine the issue of free personal care. That issue has
              been another area of concern, given the division between nursing
              care and personal care. I am delighted to hear the Minister say
              that the group has been set up. She has had more success in
              setting up a cross-party group than I have had. I wish her good
              luck, and more power to her elbow. I hope that when the group
              reports to the Executive in June, the Executive will be receptive
              and see the need for free personal care along with nursing care.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a big subject. The Assembly must do
              what it can. It has the opportunity to look after Northern Ireland’s
              elderly people, who have been crying out for a long time. That is
              just one aspect of the issue. There are many others. I fully
              support the Bill and look forward to a successful conclusion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Members for the interest that they have
              shown in the debate on the Bill. I will deal with a couple of the
              points that they have raised.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no overall increase in the number of
              non- departmental public bodies (NDPBs) within my Department.
              Although the Northern Ireland Practice and Education Council for
              Nursing and Midwifery (NIPEC) is to be established as an NDPB, an
              existing one, the National Board for Nursing, Midwifery and Health
              Visiting for Northern Ireland, is to be stood down on
              31&nbsp;March&nbsp;2002. Therefore, there will be no overall
              increase in the number of NDPBs associated with nursing and
              midwifery. I am sure that, as the Chairperson of the Committee for
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety said, they will want to
              pursue that point further at Committee Stage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NIPEC’s role is to promote the development of
              nursing and midwifery in the areas of best practice, post-
              registration education and performance. With regard to best
              practice and practice development, NIPEC will gather information
              on evidence-based best practice, review how it can best be applied
              and disseminate details to health and social care commissioners
              and providers. That will help to enhance the standards of nursing
              and midwifery care of patients throughout the service and to
              develop consistently high standards of care of patients and other
              service users.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NIPEC will be involved in quality assuring the
              standard of nursing and midwifery education. It will contribute to
              ensuring that nurses and midwives are appropriately trained before
              they treat and care for patients. NIPEC will also be able to
              assist organisations to improve the performance of nursing and
              midwifery teams and the quality of nursing care of patients in
              general. It will be a source of advice and will be able to assist
              organisations in that area directly. By supporting the development
              of the nursing and midwifery professions, NIPEC will help to
              improve the care provided to service users and the wider
              community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On free nursing care, I note the points raised
              by Mr Berry about the difficulties facing nursing homes. Indeed,
              as he said, that is why I put extra money in the Budget proposals
              to address that. However, that is a subject for another day and
              not specifically related to this legislation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey and Mr McCarthy mentioned free
              personal care. My Department has previously estimated the annual
              cost of providing free personal care for people in nursing and
              residential care homes here to be around £25 million. However,
              the interdepartmental group on personal care, which will advise on
              the costs and implications of providing free personal care, is
              expected to refine that estimate as part of its work. The group
              expects to report its findings to the Executive by the end of June
              this year and will seek to take full advantage of work that has
              already been done on free personal care in Scotland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If I have not fully covered any area that has
              been raised in the debate, I will write to the Members involved. I
              thank Members for their interest in the debate.</p>

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to be able to raise what is an
              important issue not just for people in rural border areas, such as
              my constituency, but right across Northern Ireland. The motion was
              laid before the Business Committee in October 2001, so there is no
              particular significance in its timing.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate that the Minister has initiated a
              consultation exercise on her plans to implement a newly- revised
              Ambulance Service. I want to take the opportunity to impress upon
              her the urgency of proper resources, organisation and support for
              the service. People’s lives and welfare are at stake, and the
              service is currently in complete disarray.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I preface my next remarks with the hope that no
              one thinks that I am criticising in any way the personnel at the
              coalface who provide ambulance cover and care services for
              patients. It is remarkable that they manage to sustain the service
              given so many organisational and administrative failings across
              four board areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The context of the motion is simple. The old
              target for responding to emergency incidents was inside 21
              minutes. I live in Crossmaglen, and it is impossible to get there
              from Daisy Hill Hospital in that time. I know men and women who
              have driven emergency vehicles and tried their damnedest to get to
              road traffic accidents or cardiac and other emergencies in the
              required time, but it is physically impossible. That goes for a
              large part of my Newry and Armagh constituency, from the Ballsmill
              area through Glasdrummond to Creggan, Crossmaglen, round to
              Cullyhanna and on bad days even to Newtownhamilton. There are
              between 10,000 and 15,000 people who are permanently outside the
              safe response time for accident and emergency vehicles. I am sure
              that the situation is the same in the Augher/Clogher valley and in
              parts of Fermanagh and the Glens of Antrim. Until recently, it
              applied to substantial parts of the Mournes area. Many people are,
              therefore, without the basic emergency medical cover recommended
              by the old Operational Research Consultants standards, and those
              people will be even further disadvantaged by the strategic review
              of the Ambulance Service and the new implementation strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resources will be discussed later in the
              debate. However, although they are important, resources are not
              the key issue. The strategic review of the Ambulance Service
              published in 2000 recommended that 50% of all 999 calls could be
              reached in under eight minutes. That could be achieved by
              improving the availability of accident and emergency ambulances,
              and no additional resources were required.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is what this is all about. Currently the
              service is so poorly organised and strapped by bureaucracy that
              even with existing resources the necessary service and response
              times are not achieved. The general public is probably not aware
              that the Ambulance Service in Northern Ireland is not classified
              as an emergency service, and neither is it treated or funded as
              such. Were the Fire Authority to ask for money to provide a
              service or the police to ask for money for training or new
              personnel or whatever, it would come from central funding, and
              there would be no quibbling. That funding is ring-fenced.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ambulance Service does not work that way.
              It has no single budget or single source of finance. It must sell
              the boards the number of miles travelled, the numbers of incidents
              dealt with and journeys made. It is impossible to manage a service
              in that way. If a core budget is not guaranteed year-on-year, and
              administered by a central authority, staff cannot be properly
              trained, the estate cannot be properly managed, and the fleet
              cannot be properly developed. If I ask the Minister to take any
              action as a result of this debate, it will be to look at the
              funding arrangements for the Ambulance Service and to put it on a
              par with the other emergency services, so that it can prepare,
              plan and manage the service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now make a plea for my own area. The original
              strategy published in 2000 recommended that an additional 20
              ambulance centres be established. In the Minister’s revised
              implementation programme, that figure was reduced to nine, in
              addition to the two that have already been developed. That will
              leave a substantial part of the North of Ireland without the
              necessary cover, and it will continue to leave substantial parts
              of areas such as south Armagh beyond the eight-minute response
              times. Sections of the community in Fermanagh, Armagh, Antrim and
              Down will be left outside safe response times for the foreseeable
              future. Surely that is not what the Minister or the Department
              intends. It is certainly not what communities need or want.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why was no meeting held anywhere in Newry,
              Armagh or south Armagh as part of the consultation exercise? Why,
              at the meeting held in Banbridge, was there no mention of any
              additional ambulance centres for the broad swathe of land around
              the border?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This process has been ongoing since the review
              of ambulance services was commissioned by John McFall in October
              1998. The review was published in 2000, and the implementation
              document was then produced. That document is out for consultation
              at the moment. Ambulance services exist to respond to immediate
              life-threatening situations. If parts of the problem can be
              clearly identified and solved before the review is finished, I ask
              the Minister to do that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are problems with the fleet, and I ask
              the Minister to renew her bids for money to upgrade it. There are
              also problems with the dispatch and communication systems. Until
              the review is complete, will the Minister ensure that all
              software, hardware and technology is properly tested in a Northern
              Ireland context? England had months of poorly recorded or missed
              999-calls. I hope that the preparatory work has begun, but I do
              not see many signs of that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ambulance staff and paramedics are misused. We
              must address a system that allows highly trained people with
              well-equipped ambulances to provide, for want of a better term, a
              taxi service. People must be brought to day-care and outpatient
              services, but the resources of the ambulance and accident and
              emergency services should not be drained by a job that others
              could do.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In going through some papers for today’s
              debate, I was shocked to realise that there is no guarantee of a
              trained paramedic in any ambulance dispatched. It is shocking that
              our accident and emergency services might dispatch an ambulance
              without a paramedic to a road traffic accident or to someone with
              an ectopic pregnancy or someone having a heart attack. We must
              address that urgently before we deal with anything else.</p>

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Ba
              mhaith liom tacaíocht a thabhairt do rún John Fee agus cúpla
              pointe eile a chur san áireamh fosta.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend John Fee on tabling the motion, and I
              would like to add to it. I attest to the experiences of people
              living in rural areas, such as County Armagh, which Mr Fee also
              outlined. I am aware of the particular difficulties experienced by
              people living in areas of pronounced rurality such as County
              Tyrone, south Derry and County Fermanagh with regard to ambulance
              provision. They often have to make their way to hospital in
              private vehicles or neighbours’ vehicles. People living in rural
              areas such as Cranagh on the Tyrone/Derry border also share that
              fear and anxiety when trying to access essential health services,
              and, unfortunately, the response times are not being met.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I share concerns about the downward revision of
              the targets set by the Department and the Minister. Everyone would
              like to see improved response times and improvements in survival
              rates, and that is at the heart of the overall ambulance review.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In tabling the amendment, my Colleague, Ms
              Ramsey, and I wish to draw attention to the most fundamental issue
              of all — resources. We are highlighting the link between
              Ambulance Service improvement and the adequate provision of
              resources. The Minister has often stated publicly that it will be
              a long haul to remedy past funding failures. There is a recognised
              lack of capacity in the Health Service. We must put that capacity
              back into the service and, specifically, into the Ambulance
              Service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need a commitment to long-term planning
              arrangements. Last night, the key message from the chief
              executive, Mr Lindsey, and the chairman, Mr Bradley, of the
              Western Health and Social Services Board was that there is a need
              for certainty about future funding levels.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I welcome the Minister of Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety’s presence today, I would also like
              to have seen Mr P Robinson attend. In order to have joined- up
              government, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public
              Safety, the Department for Regional Development and other
              Departments must work closely together. Rurality and poor roads
              infrastructure go hand in hand — they are virtually synonymous.
              The combined efforts of Executive Ministers are required to
              address that problem, and I hope that Mr Robinson will join those
              Ministers in making the case for greater funding and for greater
              emphasis to be placed on improving rural roads infrastructure.
              Those issues are central to the overall problem that has been
              highlighted in the motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To achieve more effective and efficient
              ambulance provision, cross-border co-operation must be
              strengthened — in fact, the border must simply disappear. People
              living in parts of the North can access hospitals in Sligo and
              Cavan more easily than they can access hospitals in a more
              northerly location. Therefore, while I agree with virtually all of
              Mr Fee’s sentiments, I would like the Executive to match that
              vision with resources.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety (Dr&nbsp;Hendron): </b>I welcome
              the opportunity to participate in this debate. The pressures faced
              by the Ambulance Service in meeting<b> its responses times are of
              vital importance to all Members, their families and their
              constituents.</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every person in need of an emergency ambulance
              should expect equity of access to ambulance services. That means a
              speedy response time and proper equipment.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The improvement of service provision is of
              fundamental importance to my Committee. The Committee will have
              failed to do its job if it does not seek answers when a public
              body such as the Ambulance Service falls short of its key targets.
              I stress the admiration that my Committee and I have for the staff
              of the Ambulance Service, who do an incredibly difficult job
              extremely well with limited resources.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Health Committee has considered the
              pressures faced by the Ambulance Service on many occasions. Most
              recently, Members examined the implementation plans of the
              Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for its
              strategic review of the Ambulance Service, ‘Mapping the Road to
              Change: A Strategic Review of the Northern Ireland Ambulance
              Service’, which sets out a phased programme of improvements to
              ensure that response time targets can be met in the future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Committee Members also met recently with the
              chairperson and chief executive of the Northern Ireland Ambulance
              Service to discuss concerns about the ability of the Ambulance
              Service to meet, at the very least, the standards set for England,
              Scotland, and Wales. We should strive to meet not only the
              standards set in these islands but the best international
              standards. The public deserves no less.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard that the Ambulance Service is not
              meeting its response time targets. Only 50% of calls are responded
              to within the eight-minute target time in the Eastern Board and
              Western Board areas, and the performance rate for the Northern
              Board and Southern Board areas is that only 46% of all calls are
              met within eight minutes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within those figures, there is considerable
              variability of performance across local government district areas.
              The problem affects rural areas hardest, especially remote areas.
              This problem was recognised by the Minister and her Department
              when she undertook the strategic review of ambulance services. The
              Committee welcomes the Minister’s proposals to improve response
              times, and it will monitor their implementation to ensure that the
              Department acts without delay to improve services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fundamental to the problems facing the
              Ambulance Service are the resources needed to do the job. The lack
              of adequate resources affects the number of ambulances and crews
              available and their ability to meet the response targets. Only two
              thirds of the emergency ambulance fleet have paramedics on board.
              The public should expect a paramedic on every emergency ambulance.
              Funding also affects areas such as training, communications and
              morale.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it is not only about extra resources;
              it is also about the efficient use of existing resources. One
              example is the need for improved co-ordination of emergency
              ambulance services across the four health boards. The emergency
              co-ordination centre at Knockbracken Healthcare Park in Belfast
              handles work for the Eastern Board and the Northern Board. The
              centre should be used as a template for a regional emergency co-
              ordination centre, which would help the service to use its
              resources more effectively to meet targets.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Funding comparisons have pointed to a
              significant difference in the money available per head of
              population. Northern Ireland receives £14·50 per head, Scotland,
              £20 per head, and Wales, £22 per head. That difference must be
              redressed. The Minister’s most recent bid, for £6·2 million to
              resource the implementation of the strategic review of the
              Ambulance Service in 2002-03, failed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The emergency Ambulance Service is a
              cornerstone of the Health Service, and the public needs to be
              reassured that lives are not being put at risk due to the
              inadequate funding of this service. The service needs an adequate
              level of resources if it is to meet the performance standards, and
              the Health Committee will give its full support to the Minister in
              her efforts to obtain a fair proportion of funding for the Health
              Service and for ambulance services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">UNISON has sent a paper to all Members, and I
              want to highlight one point that is made in it:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;There remains no awareness in the
              implementation document of an understanding of how poverty-related
              health and TSN issues need to be incorporated in targeting
              resources towards individual districts or groups of districts.
              This is particularly relevant when local government boundaries are
              under review in the review of public administration.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have made my final point on several
              occasions. Having been involved in primary care as a GP for many
              years, during all sorts of troubles, I have never known any
              ambulance driver to hold back in an emergency situation, no matter
              how much violence there was on the streets. I have great
              admiration for them.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Robert Coulter:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and commend Mr Fee for
              moving it at this time. For far too long the Ambulance Service has
              been regarded merely as patient transport and not as an emergency
              service, but the time has come when we must look on the Ambulance
              Service as a pre-hospital healthcare service. It will be an
              essential part of the review of acute hospitals. It is a
              healthcare provider that makes life better for patients in many
              different ways.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Emergency care can be influenced heavily in the
              pre-hospital phase. There is great talk about the &quot;golden
              hour&quot;, but it is coming down to the &quot;golden
              half-hour&quot;. In England and Wales it has been recommended that
              the time from when a call is received until the patient is at the
              door of an accident and emergency department should not exceed 30
              minutes. According to the equality impact assessment of the
              Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, published
              in November 2001, the performance figures from some local
              government districts are: Carrickfergus 14%; Banbridge 18%;
              Limavady 30%; Moyle 33%; North Down 30%. And so it goes on. Is 14%
              an acceptable figure? I do not think so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Standardisation of performance is necessary,
              taking rural and urban areas into account. It is easy to set times
              and to accept that the Ambulance Service is clinically meaningful.
              However, we must ask ourselves whether those times are
              operationally achievable. If they are not, we must ask ourselves
              how we can make them operationally achievable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Modern technology is available. Have our
              ambulances been fitted with automatic vehicle location? It is easy
              to send ambulances to different locations, but if an ambulance is
              answering a call that is not an emergency and then has to be
              diverted to an emergency call, surely it makes sense that it
              should be fitted with an automatic vehicle location system.
              Satellite direction to homes is another absolute must for the
              future. How much time is lost because ambulances cannot find the
              exact location of an accident or a home where there has been a
              cardiac arrest?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that digital radio will be installed
              in ambulances. As Mr Fee said, there are many radio black spots in
              our country, but in order to have an ambulance service that can
              achieve the set times, there must be total coverage. That point is
              important. However, any equipment for ambulances should be
              properly tested in a Northern Ireland context before it is
              purchased.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for her response, which I
              received this morning, to my question on stretcher beds. Many of
              the stretchers in ambulances are unacceptable, and it will cost a
              tremendous amount of money to replace them. Therefore, it is
              imperative that all equipment in ambulances should be properly
              tested before it is installed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also ask the Minister to take on board the
              difference between the retirement age of Fire Service personnel
              and ambulance personnel. The work of an ambulance crew can be
              heavy and stressful. Many ambulance personnel, when they reach the
              age of 63 or 64, find the work extremely heavy. They are unable to
              carry out the work as they should because their backs are being
              strained and so forth. In the Fire Service, one can retire at an
              earlier age.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to repeat many of the points that
              have already been made. Suffice it to say that the annual report
              of the Ambulance Service is correct when it states that this is a
              matter of life and death. Therefore, priority must be given to
              ensuring that the Ambulance Service is the best in the United
              Kingdom.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion in the name of Mr John Fee
              and welcome the fact that the motion has been tabled. It is an
              important matter that must be debated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health Committee members met the chief
              executive of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service several weeks
              ago. Indeed, the Committee meets regularly with Ambulance Service
              staff, who highlight the problems that they face. The motion
              outlines not only the pressures that they are under but also the
              response times in rural areas. The Ambulance Service is under
              immense pressure at times.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within the Health Service as a whole, we are
              back once again to the issue of resources. Much of the document
              ‘Mapping the Road to Change: A Strategic Review of the Northern
              Ireland Ambulance Service’ outlines the need for more funding
              and more resources. We must zoom in closely on those issues. The
              Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety referred to the funding comparison per capita, where
              Northern Ireland is the lowest, followed by Scotland and Wales. I
              trust that the Department will take that issue on board, because
              it must be addressed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Robert Coulter raised the issue of the
              impact of acute hospital reorganisation. All those aspects and
              issues are most important, so that we get the Ambulance Service
              right not only for the needs of the people who will use the
              service but for the needs of the staff who are currently under
              immense pressure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Delegations from the Ambulance Service have
              repeatedly made it clear to us that the funding allocation was
              totally inadequate to meet the needs of staff training, fleet
              replacement and prioritising investment within the service.
              Another major issue that was brought before us was the
              communications system, which also needs investment. When Committee
              members met departmental officials, we were glad to learn that,
              under the Executive programme funds, allocations have been
              provided for two key Ambulance Service developments in 2002-03.
              One of those relates to the introduction of digital trunk radio to
              improve communications between the Ambulance Service control,
              ambulances and hospitals.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr J Wilson] in the Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An important issue for the Department to take
              on board is the possibility of examining the amalgamation of the
              Fire Service and the Ambulance Service. When the Committee met the
              chief executive of the Ambulance Service and his colleagues, it
              was stated that there was a need for a joint approach in relation
              to the communications of those two important emergency services.
              One needs to work with the other. The Department must examine the
              possible amalgamation of those services, in addition to the
              amalgamation of the communication services. That would help both
              organisations, and it would also help to address the emergency
              needs in our community. That would also help with the
              implementation of a rapid response scheme that would provide for
              faster responses to emergencies, particularly in rural areas.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In introducing this motion, Mr Fee outlined the
              needs of rural communities and the concerns and problems
              associated with response times. The amalgamation of communication
              services could be addressed to deal with that problem. Staffing
              and staff training were also outlined.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Violent attacks on Ambulance Service staff is
              one of the biggest issues that the service has had to face
              recently. Rev Robert Coulter referred to the retirement age of 65.
              Many staff have to work 12-hour shifts, coping with manual
              handling and stressful situations. The retirement age in the Fire
              Service is 55. Eight per cent of sickness absence in the Ambulance
              Service relates to exhaustion, back trouble, stress, violence and
              age-related problems. The Committee has been told by departmental
              officials that those issues will be taken on board. Those
              important staffing issues must be addressed immediately. A person
              of 65 years of age who has to deal with equipment in an ambulance
              can be under severe pressure, and the sickness rate proves that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The level and extent of training must be
              improved. There is a shortage of paramedics, and an ongoing
              training programme for new staff and a refresher course for
              existing staff must be addressed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will be strongly opposed to attacks on
              Ambulance Service staff, and all staff who work in the Health
              Service and the public sector. It is sickening to think that the
              people who need the service are at risk because of those attacks
              on staff that make the response times impossible to meet. Like
              other Members, I condemn the attacks on Ambulance Service staff.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Committee met the Department it learnt
              that money was being provided to deal with the raising of
              awareness in schools. The Committee was glad to learn that a pilot
              community education programme has been funded through the
              Department to raise awareness. Education programmes in schools
              will address the importance of the Ambulance Service and its work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Fire Service has an education programme in
              schools to highlight the importance and the need for that
              emergency service. About a month ago, concern was expressed to the
              Committee that there was no such programme available in the
              Ambulance Service. Members were glad to learn from the Department
              that that issue is being addressed, and we trust that it will have
              a positive outcome for the betterment not only of the Ambulance
              Service but also the whole community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fortunately, those attacks have stopped, and we
              trust that we will not hear of any more attacks on the Ambulance
              Service, the police, the Fire Service or any other people in the
              community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Response times in rural areas are another major
              problem, and other Members have highlighted the issue well.
              Unfortunately, Northern Ireland is falling behind Great Britain in
              basic standards of service provision, fleet maintenance and
              training. That is due to a lack of funding, and it will affect our
              ability to meet the standards for response times to emergency
              calls. Our constituents deserve better, and the Ambulance Service
              deserves better. The service is working under extreme pressure due
              to a lack of funding, and the Department must address that issue
              not only for the sake of our constituents but also for Ambulance
              Service staff. We commend the staff of the Ambulance Service for
              working under such extreme pressures. We must represent them to
              the best of our ability. I trust that all the issues mentioned
              will be taken on board and that action will be taken on many of
              the concerns that have been raised. I support the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of the Alliance Party, I want to put
              on record our thanks and appreciation to all members of the
              Ambulance Service who have served the entire community through
              years of murder and mayhem and who have been in the forefront of
              picking up the pieces, whether as a result of bombing, shooting,
              car accidents or other incidents. They have done, and continue to
              do, a superb job. As Mr Berry said, we hope that the recent and
              ongoing assaults on the Ambulance Service will cease immediately
              so that staff can get on with what they have been trained to do.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that by having a debate on the Ambulance
              Service we will contribute to the overall well-being of everyone
              in the community and see co-operation between all those involved
              in the Ambulance Service. We are grateful for Mr Fee’s motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The emphasis is on rural areas such as the
              Strangford constituency, which I represent. As I understand it,
              the eastern division is classified as rural and, therefore, must
              meet the performance standards for a rural area. The acute
              hospital services review recommends that there should be a
              significant increase in investment in the Ambulance Service. The
              Minister has endorsed detailed plans to secure improvements to the
              availability and quality of the Ambulance Service throughout
              Northern Ireland. We wish her every success in her endeavours.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall highlight some figures that emphasise
              the need to introduce a medical priority despatch system.
              Presently, calls to the Ambulance Service are not prioritised.
              Prioritisation has been introduced in all ambulance services in
              England, but not in Northern Ireland. The Alliance Party endorses
              its implementation here, starting with a pilot in the Eastern
              Health and Social Services Board area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The targets in England for non-prioritised
              calls are the same as for Northern Ireland. Within each board
              area, 50% of all emergency calls must be answered within eight
              minutes. In the Eastern Health and Social Services Board area, 95%
              of all emergency calls must be answered within 18 minutes, and
              within 21 minutes in the other three board areas. The two regions
              compare similarly. Our four health and social services boards are
              not the best, but they are not the worst. In handling over 35,000
              emergency calls, the Eastern Health and Social Services Board
              responded to 62·7% of those within eight minutes and 96·9%
              within the 18 minutes to 21 minutes target.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order that the implementation proposals can
              improve response time, the new medical priority despatch system
              must be introduced. I appeal to the Minister and her Department to
              launch a public awareness campaign to emphasise the equality
              implications for patients in the new patient care services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategic review implementation proposals
              go further than the exercise in England by establishing targets
              for local government districts. That decision is to be welcomed,
              and it will provide more detailed and honest figures and
              evaluations of performances. The Alliance Party supports any
              proposals that can get an ambulance to where it is needed in as
              short a time as possible and hopes that additional accident and
              emergency vehicles and crews will operate in outlying rural areas
              such as Saintfield, Killyleagh and Portaferry. Portaferry is at
              the tip of the Ards Peninsula, and anything that will reduce
              precious time in an emergency must be provided. I appeal to the
              Minister to ensure that those proposals are implemented as soon as
              possible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was pleased to hear the Minister say this
              morning that progress is being made on the all-Ireland air
              ambulance service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Boyd:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to place on record my personal
              appreciation, and that of my party Colleagues, to the Northern
              Ireland Ambulance Service for its dedication and professionalism
              in serving the entire community with impartiality and displaying
              great courage over many years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is appalling that there are those in society
              who are prepared to attack ambulance staff and other members of
              the emergency services as they carry out their duties. The attacks
              must stop, and the courts must deal adequately with those who are
              guilty of such disgraceful attacks. There are an alarming number
              of attacks on ambulance staff and other staff inside and outside
              hospitals. This escalating problem must be effectively addressed.
              In 2000-01 reported incidents of violence against ambulance staff
              totalled 71, in comparison with 43 in the previous year. It is
              vital that the general public supports the Ambulance Service and
              helps to eradicate the attacks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The speed of response of ambulances to accident
              and emergency situations is critical at the time of a call and at
              attendance at the scene. There is concern, however, that some
              response targets are not being achieved. In the financial year
              2000-01 two of the four health board areas — the Northern Board
              with 47% and the Southern Board with 42% — did not achieve the
              50% target for accident and emergency ambulances to arrive at the
              scene in eight minutes. It is vital that, in emergencies,
              intervention and treatment for life-threatening conditions such as
              cardiac arrest begin as quickly as possible after the onset of the
              arrest. The targets of 95% of accident and emergency ambulances
              reaching the scene in 18 minutes for urban areas and 21 minutes
              for rural areas were not achieved in three of the four health
              board areas in 2000-01: the Northern Board with 94%, the Southern
              Board with 92% and the Western Board with 94%.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were over 71,000 emergency calls in
              2000-01, and the responses that were not achieved within the
              performance standard amount to several hundred in some areas. The
              times for each ambulance station over the quarter ending 31
              December 2001 for response at the scene in eight minutes have a
              wide variance. In the Eastern Board area, the highest response
              rate is Ardoyne station at 71%, and the lowest is Downpatrick at
              35%. In the Western Board, the highest response rate is
              Altnagelvin station at 59%, and the lowest is Castlederg at 37%.
              The Northern Board also has a large variance. The highest response
              rate is Antrim at 58%, and the lowest is Ballymoney at 32%. In the
              Southern Board, the highest response rate is Newry station at 53%,
              and the lowest is Craigavon at 30%.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that some response times must be
              improved and greater consistency achieved, particularly in rural
              areas. The necessary resources must be made available, and
              measures must be put in place to achieve the required improvements
              in response times as a priority.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned that, despite unanimous support
              from the district council — and I wear two hats for this — for
              the provision of an ambulance outstation on the Ards Peninsula,
              there have not been any plans for one under the current Health
              Minister or in the current Ambulance Service proposals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are here today to discuss rural needs in
              relation to ambulance provision. The Northern Ireland Ambulance
              Service recently held a public meeting in the Strangford Arms
              Hotel in Newtownards to outline its proposals for the Province as
              a whole and for the Ards Borough Council area in particular. The
              Ambulance Service has been seriously underfunded over the years,
              and we were given dramatic figures at that meeting. We spend only
              £14 per person, as much as £10 less than Scotland and Wales.
              When compared with the Northern Ireland Fire Authority, the
              figures were even more dramatic.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government, and the Department, must take
              steps to provide the funding that the hard-pressed Ambulance
              Service is desperate for. For 12 years Ards Borough Council has
              pressed hard for an outstation on the Ards Peninsula. It knows the
              needs and tries to reflect them. That commitment, and the need
              itself, has grown as the population has increased. The roads of
              the Ards Peninsula are, by nature, twisty and narrow, and the
              population is predominantly rural and widely spread. In the
              summer, the population grows by as many as 20,000 people, so it
              takes even longer to get to an accident on the lower Ards
              Peninsula, and that could result in a dramatic increase in the
              number of deaths.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems that the major reasons for the
              inability of the Ambulance Service to upgrade and provide better
              and more efficient services are money and manpower. As the problem
              continues and the Ambulance Service in the Province falls further
              behind, it could well be time to consider some short-term
              assistance. There is an organisation called ProParamedics, which
              is a professional, experienced group that is willing and able to
              assist. It has trained and expert staff, who already assist at a
              number of venues in the Province. It has come into being because
              the Ambulance Service and St John Ambulance — a voluntary group
              — have not been able to assist due to financial and manpower
              restrictions. Staff resources are already being squeezed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I request that ProParamedics be fully
              considered if substantial manpower and funding are not made
              available immediately. It says that it can offer a service at a
              much better and competitive rate and be there within the
              prescribed time to meet all emergencies. It is available. Even if
              full training took place today for Ambulance Service personnel,
              they might not be ready to take up their posts right away.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Problems are further exacerbated because
              ambulances are able to take only one injured person to hospital at
              a time; in serious accidents the numbers of ambulances needed
              increase greatly. The pressure is on the Ambulance Service, and a
              fair and positive response for outstations or rapid-response units
              must take place — not, as we have been told, at a predetermined
              location; there has to be a full and fair look at the entire
              Province.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call on the Minister and the Ambulance
              Service to create a rapid-response centre and outstation on the
              Ards Peninsula, which has already been justified by its needs. The
              outstation or rapid-response method could work effectively for the
              peninsula, perhaps working out of the health centre in Kircubbin.
              Again, I put that forward as a suggestion. It would be a clear and
              direct way of trying to help. There is a centre there that could
              be made available, and it could well be the outstation or
              rapid-response centre for the peninsula.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is, therefore, disappointing that the
              commitment we sought from the Ambulance Service for the outstation
              has not been forthcoming. Perhaps the Minister can confirm that no
              decisions have been made, that nothing is predetermined, and that
              the outstation for the Ards Peninsula is still in the running. The
              Department said that there would be three pilot schemes for the
              Province but suggested that other places would probably be chosen.
              On three occasions it mentioned three places: the Sperrins, the
              Glens of Antrim and Fermanagh. I am not saying that any of those
              locations should not get the outstations, but the Ards Peninsula
              needs one more than most.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The outstation is crucial for people there. It
              is imperative to ensure a shorter response time for accidents and
              injuries, and I implore the Ambulance Service and the Department
              to review the situation and ensure that there is a pilot scheme
              for the Ards Peninsula. So far they have failed to deliver any
              sort of assurance to elected representatives. There is still time,
              and opportunity, to ensure that the Ards Peninsula gets its much
              needed and long overdue ambulance provision. Time, effort and need
              demand it.</p>

              leor daoine gortaithe agus breoite le sábháil gach bliain.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Fee for bringing this matter to the
              House. I have listened with interest to the views expressed and
              welcome the opportunity that the debate has provided to consider
              the problems facing the Ambulance Service, which is an integral
              and important part of health and personal social services, as has
              been stated in the debate. Efficient and effective ambulance
              provision is essential if the lives of many injured and sick
              people are to be saved each year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key performance measure for the Ambulance
              Service is its ability to meet clearly defined response standards.
              The current targets for the service are to respond within eight
              minutes to 50% of all emergency calls, to respond to 95% of all
              emergency calls within 18 minutes in the Eastern Board area and
              within 21 minutes in all other board areas. As has been made clear
              these standards are met only in the Eastern and Western Board
              areas, and within them there is considerable variation in
              performance. It is no coincidence that the areas in which the
              Ambulance Service fails to meet current response targets are
              mainly, though not exclusively, rural areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The implementation plan and the strategic
              review of the Ambulance Service contain a series of measures to
              reduce the differentials between urban and rural areas, to improve
              overall response times and to improve the quality of responses by
              the provision of enhanced staff training. The plan sets out
              clearly the need for fundamental investment in the service if it
              is to make these improvements, and it is specific on what is
              required and the likely costs. Several Members took up that point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there has been, and continues to be,
              significant investment in the Ambulance Service — over the last
              three years, over 100 new vehicles have been put on the road.
              Significant investment has been made in new equipment and in the
              training and development of staff.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the recommendations of the
              implementation plan is that there should be additional response
              points for accident and emergency ambulances to enable the
              travelling time to incidents to be reduced. Four additional
              response points are on stream, and more are planned.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recommendation of the strategic review for
              20 more locations was not supported by any statistical
              information. The issue is revised and revisited in the proposed
              implementation plan, based on computer-modelling of locations and
              response times. I can confirm that 11 additional locations are
              proposed and that consultation meetings have already identified
              alternative locations based on local knowledge.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also pleased to confirm that, as well as
              additional resources for the coming year, an additional £300,000
              will be made available next year to begin the medical priority
              despatch system — a protocol which will help ambulance control
              staff to determine whether an incident is life-threatening and
              thus use existing resources more effectively; to improve the
              24-hour on-call arrangements for responses to major incidents; to
              put in place measures to address problems with attacks on
              ambulance staff, including a trial programme to help prepare crews
              to deal with potentially violent situations; and a pilot community
              education programme for children and young people. That is on top
              of the additional £1 million already available to the Ambulance
              Service for 2002-03 for training and developing paramedics and
              other staff.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have also secured a total of £3·2 million
              for digital trunk radio systems and rapid responder schemes,
              £1·1 million of which will be available to the Ambulance Service
              in 2002-03. The introduction of digital trunk radio provides for
              clearer and more secure communications between ambulance control
              staff and the other emergency services and will have many benefits
              in relation to the quality and timing of responses to emergency
              calls.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In that respect, I noted the points that Mr
              Berry made about closer communication systems and working
              together. Recent discussions and work have focused on closer
              co-operation between the Fire Service and the Ambulance Service.
              That is one of the reasons why the two services were put into the
              same Department — the Department of Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety — when the new arrangements were made.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note with some regret that Mr Berry kept
              talking about what he had heard from departmental officials when
              he was quoting the responses that I had given to him face to face,
              when I met with him and his Committee colleagues in order to
              discuss budget proposals. Given that I had the professionalism to
              provide those responses, I hope that after this morning he will
              remember that they came from me.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rapid responder schemes will have a
              particularly important role in improving the response in rural
              areas. There will be four rapid responder four-wheel drive
              vehicles — one in each of the board areas — each driven by a
              paramedic. Those vehicles will be situated in areas where the
              response times are particularly poor because of rural isolation or
              poor road networks. In addition, plans have been developed for
              pilot first responder schemes in rural areas, under the remit of
              the North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC). Those schemes will
              train people from the community in basic life-saving skills, so
              that they can provide support in the vital minutes that it takes
              for an ambulance to arrive on the scene.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I have concentrated on speed of
              response, which is of obvious significance, simply improving
              response times will not improve clinical outcomes for patients.
              Increasingly, the focus has been turning towards the quality of
              care that Ambulance Service personnel provide before a patient
              arrives at hospital. Recommendations in that area include
              improvements in training and development and the introduction of
              clinical audit procedures and systems. Ambulance Service is
              continually examining ways to improve the quality of service that
              it delivers. Over the past three years I have been able to make
              over £3 million available for Ambulance Service modernisation. I
              have also secured over £3 million with which to improve Ambulance
              Service communications and to pilot rapid-responder schemes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The provision of those measures — the
              additional ambulance locations, the rapid-responder schemes, the
              introduction of first-responder schemes and the strategic
              deployment of ambulances — as identified in the implementation
              plan, are measures specifically designed to improve response times
              in rural areas. However, the extent to which various measures can
              be initiated — including the provision of paramedics — depends
              largely on the availability of the additional resources. The
              Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety has already mentioned that my most recent bid was
              not met. However, I assure Members that, as they requested this
              morning, I will continue to bid for resources for that important
              aspect of my Department’s services. The issue of roads was
              raised this morning. However, it is not within my remit and is a
              matter for the Minister for Regional Development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public consultation meetings took place in
              locations with the poorest response times in each board area. As
              part of the consultation process departmental officials offered to
              meet with any group wishing to air their views in that way.
              Several meetings have taken place in response to such requests.
              Those are continuing, even though the formal end of the
              consultation period was 15 February 2002. A request from Newry and
              Mourne Health and Social Services Trust was made at the end of
              last week. Arrangements are currently being made for that meeting.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the question about ambulances
              being used as a taxi service, the strategic review report
              highlighted the inappropriate use of accident and emergency
              (A&amp;E) vehicles in the transport of patients to and from
              hospital appointments. The proposed separation of the management
              of A&amp;E and patient care services (PCS) and further investment
              in the A&amp;E and PCS fleets will ensure that A&amp;E vehicles
              will not be diverted away from emergency calls.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ambulance Service is also aware of the need
              to make the public aware of what the medical priority despatch
              system will be, and it will introduce a public awareness
              programme. The Department will provide appropriate support to
              ensure that public concerns about the medical priority despatch
              system are addressed effectively.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bob Coulter mentioned the retirement age for
              Ambulance Service personnel. That is not locally negotiated but is
              carried out in England as part of the normal negotiations on pay
              and conditions of service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Violence against ambulance staff is of great
              concern to us all. The Ambulance Service has been in discussions
              with staff-side representatives about the measures it could take
              to minimise the risk to ambulance crews. I will meet
              representatives from UNISON to discuss that issue in the near
              future. In the meantime, my officials and Ambulance Service
              management are looking at initiatives to better protect staff and
              preclude further attacks, such as more robust windscreens in
              vehicles and community education projects, which I mentioned
              earlier.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Direct comparisons with response times of other
              ambulance services are not possible. The performance of GB
              services is measured on the basis of emergency calls categorised
              by level of urgency, and GB ambulance services are required to
              respond to 75% of life-threatening — or category A — calls
              within eight minutes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recognition of the Ambulance Service as an
              emergency service was mentioned. Ambulance services are provided
              to ensure that people who are ill can access health services under
              the provision of the Health and Personal Social Services (Northern
              Ireland) Order 1972. The accident and emergency ambulance service
              is generally perceived as an emergency service, but my officials
              are investigating what benefits, if any, would result from
              formally recognising it as such.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards regional funding, the proposed new
              commissioning arrangements are intended to result in a
              co-ordinated, corporate approach to the development of the
              Ambulance Service. Health and social services boards currently
              negotiate with the ambulance trust individually. The new model is
              based on a single commissioning group, including representatives
              from the four health and social services boards. Through that
              group, new service developments will be agreed on a regional
              basis.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Important though the recent and planned
              investments are, as is the work that we have taken forward to
              date, they fall short of the full implementation plan. There is a
              significant additional cost to implementing all measures proposed
              in the plan. For example, to achieve a 50% response rate to all
              emergency calls in all board areas within eight minutes will
              require a recurrent minimum allocation for ambulance services of
              £3 million a year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To meet other more ambitious response time
              targets, additional funding of £8 million a year would be
              required for the first two years, with a minimum of £5 million a
              year thereafter. That is against a background of a limited
              departmental budget and the continuing pressures across the whole
              spectrum of health and personal social services. Therefore the
              speed at which improvements can be achieved will depend on the
              level of additional funding available. The Chairperson of the
              Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety referred
              to the fate of bids that I made this year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Responses to the consultation on the
              implementation of the strategic review are being collated and
              evaluated. I will, in due course, feed the key messages from that
              back to Members. However, on the basis of the consultation so far,
              people clearly have genuine concerns about the need to improve the
              Ambulance Service, and response times in particular. In that
              respect, I welcome today’s debate on those issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Significant investment in additional ambulances
              and crews is required to improve response times. I have sought
              every opportunity to provide additional funds for the Ambulance
              Service and will continue to do so. Indeed, I will continue to
              press and to take every opportunity to try to secure and provide
              additional funds for this vital service. I recognise that, even in
              these times of pressure on services overall, the Ambulance Service
              must be seen as a key element in providing effective and equitable
              healthcare for everyone.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I
              too commend Mr John Fee for moving this motion, and I will add to
              the reasons outlined by my Colleague, Barry McElduff, for moving
              an amendment to it. I also take the opportunity to commend and
              thank the Ambulance Service staff for their years of hard work and
              dedication and to point out that the level of attacks on staff has
              increased and must stop. The Committee for Health, Social Services
              and Public Safety discussed the matter last week.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate was mature and informed and covered
              the issues faced by the Ambulance Service. I agree with John Fee
              that the ring-fencing of money must be examined and that the
              Ambulance Service cannot develop without a proper budget and
              funding, and I will come back to that later. The basis of the
              amendment is that many of the services in the Department of
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety cannot operate without
              long-term strategic funding.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the many Members who referred to
              the poor response time in rural areas. We must compare that with
              the time taken to respond in urban areas. With regard to a
              joined-up, collective approach, I commend the Minister for
              Regional Development for his presence throughout most of the
              debate. I hope that he and his officials will read Hansard closely
              and take note of what has been said about the roads
              infrastructure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Health Service has been underfunded for
              years. Sadly, it has reached a stage where money is scarce and
              different parts of the sector are fighting each other for it. That
              must be examined. The need for £57 million to build a new cancer
              centre was discussed as recently as 5 March. Earlier today we
              spoke of additional money for free care of the elderly. We have
              talked recently about money needed for children’s services,
              community care, the acute sector, the Fire Service and the
              Ambulance Service. One is no more important than the other, but
              the list is endless, and I apologise if anything has been missed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health was made a priority in the Programme for
              Government, and that fact must be addressed. The Executive have
              said that they will deal with health as a priority, and it must be
              impressed upon them that proper long-term funding is necessary. It
              is sad that lives are at risk if the Executive do not commit
              resources to resolving the matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for her attendance at the
              debate and for the statement she made earlier regarding North/
              South co-operation. The all-island accident and emergency service
              mentioned earlier today is an example of that. That service would
              improve the situation in the border counties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the point about the
              infrastructure, the Department for Regional Development appealed
              to the goodwill of farmers concerning the gritting of roads. That
              collective approach and response solved some of the problems.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Chairperson of the Committee
              for Health, Social Services and Public Safety that it is important
              for the Ambulance Service to meet response times. It is pointless
              to specify such times if the will to meet them is not there, but
              its absence is again linked to underfunding.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Joe Hendron that the Committee
              welcomes the Minister’s proposals to improve response times. As
              he says, health boards must co-operate to improve the response
              times of ambulances. He also pointed out that the Minister had
              made a bid for £6·2 million for the Ambulance Service. That bid
              was not approved by the Executive. Again, I must ask whether that
              demonstrates that health is a priority for the Executive, because
              it does not seem so to me.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Bob Coulter that the Ambulance
              Service is sometimes seen as a personal bus service or patient
              transport service. I also agree that we must consider the
              retirement age for ambulance personnel and take on board the
              Minister’s comments. The Committee must look at that closely,
              because it is decided and negotiated in England.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paul Berry mentioned the need for more funding
              and resources. As a fellow member of the Committee for Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety, I support him. We are all aware
              of the lack of funding for the service, and we should not have to
              decide to fund certain provisions to the exclusion of others. Like
              Paul Berry, I welcome the Minister’s announcement of the
              setting-up of the education scheme to tackle the ongoing attacks
              on Ambulance Service personnel.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Minister that the Ambulance
              Service is an important part of the remit of the Department of
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety. She said that in most
              cases, the Ambulance Service fails to meet its targets in rural
              areas. The problem must be tackled urgently. The Minister
              highlighted the additional investment, which resulted in around
              100 new vehicles and new equipment. Some £300,000 has been
              allocated to the dispatch system. I welcome that as a positive
              step forward, but I do not think that it is enough, even taking on
              board the constraints with which the Minister is faced. Everyone
              who has taken part in this debate has shown that there is a
              problem of underfunding.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank John Fee for ensuring that the motion
              reached the Floor of the House. I am pleased that there is general
              agreement that adequate funding is crucial to improving, not only
              ambulance response time, but the service as a whole. I hope that
              all parties will continue to support the Minister in her efforts
              to obtain adequate funding for the service.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Fee:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for taking time to come
              here today and for her fairly comprehensive overview of what is
              happening in the Ambulance Service. I also thank Members for
              taking part in the debate. We are all singing from the same hymn
              sheet, so I will not go over all the details that have been
              discussed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister talked about providing equitable
              healthcare for the whole community. That is basically what the
              debate is all about. Under various pieces of legislation we have
              made it illegal to discriminate on the grounds of age, gender,
              political or religious views, disability or sexual orientation. We
              should probably have written into the legislation that there must
              also be equity between rural and urban dwellers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I tried to make that point to a senior
              health board official, he insultingly and facetiously said that he
              supposed that I wanted an acute hospital in every village in south
              Armagh. My response is not publishable. However, the thrust of it
              was that I did not, but that if we could not have acute services
              on everyone’s doorsteps, we would have to rely on the people who
              provide the ambulance, GP and primary care services in those
              communities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my area, certain acute services have been
              removed from Daisy Hill Hospital and some hospital services have
              been closed in Armagh. GP out-of-hours schemes have been created
              that have reduced the number of GPs available at weekends and
              evenings. These schemes rely on the Ambulance Service as a
              back-up. In that context, the Executive as a whole must make the
              Ambulance Service a priority.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also for that reason that my Colleagues
              and I will not oppose the amendment — if it gets the Executive’s
              attention, so much the better.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a remarkable urgency about this,
              because a great deal of consultation is necessary, and the
              proposals and the implementation strategy must be tested against
              various models. Nonetheless, this issue should have priority over
              all others.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has said that this issue will be
              examined. As with the Fire Service and the Police Service, the
              Ambulance Service should be a discrete, stand-alone centrally
              funded emergency service, and the sooner we achieve that the
              better. I thank the Minister and Members for their attendance and
              comments.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for
              being able to have this debate today. I also want to thank the
              Minister in advance for his patience and for being here to listen
              to what is an important issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Exactly one year ago this month, a young woman,
              Orla Hewitt, lost her life in a horrific accident on the Belfast
              to Bangor road. It was a Friday evening. She was driving home from
              work on her own, and she was hit by a lorry crossing the
              carriageway. Her life was not the only one devastated that day.
              Her four-year-old daughter was left without a mother, and her
              parents, her partner, her family and her friends all have to
              suffer the terrible consequences of this for the rest of their
              lives. I had the privilege of knowing Orla, and this debate is by
              way of paying tribute to her and her family and all the other
              families who have lost loved ones in tragic circumstances on our
              roads. I want to do more than pay tribute. I want to use the
              mandate that I have been given to press for positive change to
              reduce the terrible toll of death and destruction on the roads.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate is about the Belfast to Bangor road,
              believed to be one of the most dangerous roads in the country. It
              is said that people are taking their lives in their hands when
              they use this road, and the figures I have gleaned recently bear
              this out — they are nothing short of shocking. Ten people have
              been killed on this 10-to-11-mile stretch of road over the past
              three years — yes, 10 people on this small stretch of road over
              the past three years. If those people had died as a result of
              paramilitary activity, there would be uproar. However, this is a
              different type of terror that stalks us, and it is just as
              shocking, just as horrific and just as devastating for the
              families of the victims. Some might argue that, given the high
              volume of traffic on this road — and the statistics show that
              something in the region of 39,000 vehicles per day use it, which
              certainly is high — relatively speaking, the number of
              fatalities is low. However, everyone will agree that one death is
              one too many.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The figures for the period 1998-99 to 2000-01
              show that 270 people were injured on the Belfast to Bangor road,
              of whom 42 were seriously injured. Serious injuries can include
              brain damage, loss of limbs and other horrific outcomes that
              statistics cannot possibly describe. Over a three-year period 270
              people were injured, that is, 90 people injured on this short
              stretch of road each year. I am sure the Minister and everyone
              will agree that this is totally unacceptable. The cost, in terms
              of human tragedy, is far too great to calculate, and the Minister
              has heard me on many occasions referring to the cost to the
              economy of the casualties and deaths from road accidents. However,
              if those calculations are correct with regard to emergency
              services, healthcare, loss of income and productivity, the cost of
              those killed or seriously injured on the A2 since 1998 must surely
              go into tens of millions of pounds. That is why I cannot accept as
              justification the excuse that traffic-calming engineering works to
              slow down the speed of traffic are too costly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I paint a bleak picture. However, on the
              positive side, it does not have to be that way, because we have
              the power to change the situation. That is why a debate of this
              nature is valuable. The Assembly can channel the anger and
              frustration of families, road safety groups, local councillors who
              have campaigned for years for something to be done, road users who
              are sick and tired of facing those dangers daily, and the
              emergency services who have to witness and deal with those tragic
              events into a positive outcome. Devolved government gives us the
              power to do something. The road is dangerous; it must be made
              safe.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In preparation for the debate, I spoke to many
              people who are closely involved — the police, road safety
              campaigners, people who live and work in the area and people who
              use the road regularly. There is general agreement that one of the
              most dangerous parts of the road is the stretch between
              Ballyrobert — which is at the Crawfordsburn turn-off — and the
              entrance to Holywood.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The road is best described as a dual
              carriageway without the safeguards. It is a four-lane highway with
              nothing separating the traffic. Many Members have used that road
              on many occasions and are aware of the dangers. The lanes are far
              too narrow. The speed limit is 50 miles per hour, and a car can
              stop dead in the outside lane to turn right, whether it is going
              to or coming from Belfast.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is sheer madness to allow that to continue;
              therefore, I am proposing several actions to make the road safe.
              First, a central crash barrier should be built to separate the
              lanes of traffic and to prevent people from turning right off the
              main highway. Secondly, the speed limit should be reduced to at
              least 40 miles per hour on the stretch between Ballyrobert and the
              outskirts of Holywood. Currently, the route runs down from a dual
              carriageway with a central reservation and a speed limit of 60
              miles per hour into a road with a speed limit of 50 miles per hour
              and absolutely no safeguards between the oncoming flows of
              traffic.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There should also be more rigorous enforcement
              of the speed limits along the road. For example, new ideas and new
              legislation should be examined to allow fines to be used to pay
              for enforcement projects. I will go into that issue in more detail
              later. Better signage is also needed, and I suggest the use of the
              speed-reducing strips that are on many dual carriageways to reduce
              cars’ speeds as they come to an intersection. Those measures
              would be valuable in reducing the speed of traffic on the road.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that excessive speed is a
              major killer on the Bangor to Belfast Road. It is treated as a
              speedway, which is why new ways of policing speed limits must be
              examined. There is such a thing as a &quot;netting- off&quot;
              scheme, where revenue from fines is used to pay the cost of, for
              example, new high-tech speed camera schemes. That should be
              seriously considered, even as a pilot project, for this stretch of
              road. Apparently, the project has worked successfully in
              Nottinghamshire. We should try to adopt the best practice
              exemplified elsewhere in the United Kingdom, in these islands and
              in continental Europe.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many other dangerous points along the
              stretch of road, including the Rathgael junction on the outskirts
              of Bangor and the Croft Road junction at Holywood. Parking also
              poses problems. There are no parking restrictions whatsoever, or
              occasionally there is a double yellow line. A red line warning
              that parked cars will be towed away would be a valuable
              introduction. Time does not permit me to detail other aspects of
              that issue. I want to give other Colleagues a chance to speak
              their minds on the issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have spoken about the actions that can be
              taken to reduce the number of people killed and seriously injured
              on the road. In my call to the Minister for progress, I am also
              sounding a serious warning. A time will come — and it already
              has come in the United States — when families of victims test
              through the courts whether the authorities have done enough to
              protect road users. We must be conscious of that. The time has
              come for an end to buck-passing between Departments; they must now
              augment the strategy and resources for road safety. Much more
              money is needed for road safety, whether for use by the Department
              of the Environment, the Department for Regional Development or the
              Police Service’s Traffic Branch. The time has come for action,
              and I am not just talking about the Bangor to Belfast road; I am
              talking about roads throughout the Province.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I spoke to a police inspector who said that
              there must be sea change in the culture that accepts that
              accidents are inevitable. No level of deaths on the roads is
              acceptable. Zero tolerance is imperative. The time has come for
              action so that no more families must bring flowers to the Bangor
              to Belfast road. I rest my case.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Ms Morrice for bringing the debate to
              the House. This is an opportunity to discuss a serious problem in
              north Down. The Bangor to Belfast road has been in its present
              configuration for about 40 years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I went to school in the area, and I can recall
              walking about a mile along that road to church on Sundays. At that
              stage it was a heavily used road, and it has remained in much the
              same state and configuration since then, with some modifications.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Traffic flow on the road has increased
              dramatically over the years. The ‘Family of Settlements’
              document shows that Bangor has had a 20% increase in its
              population in the past 20 years, and since a majority of people in
              north Down work outside the area — many of them in Belfast —
              the traffic flow along that road has increased dramatically.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The road is dangerous. There are four lanes —
              two each way — closing at what can be a combined speed of 120
              miles per hour. Although there is a 50 miles per hour speed limit
              on the road, most drivers tend to travel about 60 miles per hour
              and some even faster than that. There are high speeds and high
              volumes of traffic on a road designed 40 years ago for a much
              lower volume of traffic. Ms Morrice has already described one of
              the main difficulties on the road. On the stretch of road between
              Cultra and Craigavad there are a series of right turns, and some
              of those arrive as a surprise to the unwary driver because they
              have just driven over the brow of a hill. Unless drivers know the
              road, they can suddenly find that the traffic in front of them in
              the outside lane has stopped dead. Drivers try to cut in, and that
              leads to accidents.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Action of some sort must be taken to do away
              with the threat to life described by Ms Morrice. Some years ago I
              saw a plan for a new motorway on the Craigantlet side in the hills
              parallel to the road. The difficulty is that the price of land in
              Northern Ireland is so high that there is no possibility that the
              Department would be able to buy the land, let alone afford the
              money to build a motorway. There was another cunning plan to build
              a parallel motorway on the lough shore side. However, the cost of
              those motorways is clearly prohibitive, and it is unlikely that
              they will be built.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What can we do? One solution is to reduce the
              volume of cars. Colleagues in the House will be aware of the
              regional development strategy and of the regional transportation
              strategy currently being developed by the Department for Regional
              Development. They will also know from previous speeches made in
              the House that the Bangor railway line is being relaid and that it
              is to be hoped that there will be new trains on that line next
              year as a flagship for the way ahead in public transport. That
              will allow the Department to encourage commuters to leave their
              cars in a park-and-ride and travel to and from Belfast by train.
              If all goes well, that should reduce substantially the volume of
              traffic on the road. However, that will not do away with the
              problem.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice identified various actions, and I
              agree with most of them. Right turns must be banned, and that is
              something that can be done fairly easily. Some thought would have
              to be given as to how people who live on the opposite side of the
              road get home. One option would be to construct one or two new
              crossover bridges. That would be expensive, but traffic volume
              will increase in the future — although that could be reduced by
              public transport — so we must start looking 10 years ahead and
              construct those bridges to allow people to get back over the
              carriageway and have access to their homes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The idea of an Armco barrier is attractive on
              the fast sections of the road, and provided that there are
              crossover areas, that could be managed. Clearly it is not suitable
              where people travelling away from Belfast need to get to the
              Craigantlet side. They must be able to get into their houses
              somehow. So that is perhaps a combination and a development of
              possible solutions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may be possible to introduce rush-hour speed
              limits. Experiments on the M25, where 60 miles per hour speed
              limits were introduced, showed that traffic travelling at a
              constant pace produced a much larger volume of traffic going
              safely through a given point at a particular time. There may be a
              case for introducing some form of rush-hour speed limit.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I oppose Ms Morrice’s contention that there
              should be low speed limits at all times on the Bangor to Belfast
              road. During the day, when there is a much lower volume of
              traffic, it would be unfair to interfere too much with the rights
              of the motorist to drive at a normal and sensible speed, provided
              that the right-turn risks are taken away. That would not be as
              much of a problem in such circumstances. Actions must be taken
              that would lead to a suitable compromise so that there is not too
              much interference during the day, but that deal with problems at
              difficult times.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the Minister to re-examine the problems
              on the Bangor to Belfast road. Action must be taken now, because
              the projections and the problems will get worse unless there is a
              plan to deal with them.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall speak briefly on the motion for two
              reasons. First, as a frequent user of the Bangor to Belfast road,
              I know the problems associated with it and the volume of traffic
              that it carries. Secondly, in the enforced absence of my party
              Colleague Mrs Eileen Bell, a Member for the constituency in which
              the road lies, we would not wish the voice of Alliance to go
              unheard by default.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Coming from the Ards Peninsula, I hope that I
              can be forgiven for comparing roads in my area with the Bangor to
              Belfast road and for saying, as gently as I can, that some people
              do not know when they are well off. The Bangor to Belfast road has
              been a major problem for many years. It was a problem in the days
              when the volume of traffic was but a small fraction of the present
              cavalry charge. Experts have often considered the problem, and
              alterations have been carried out as a result of their studies.
              The camber has been improved on some of the more dangerous bends.
              The road was widened slightly where it was possible to do so. A
              section of dual carriageway was built at the Bangor end of the
              road. However, the problems persist.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are too many cars for too narrow a road.
              Speeding seems to be the norm, and unfortunately serious accidents
              are inevitable. Widening the road is not possible where it is most
              needed, and no amount of campaigning will overcome that fact. The
              entire Northern Ireland block grant would be needed to compensate
              the adjoining landowners for eating into their front gardens,
              never mind the cost of the construction. The Alliance Party would
              support any agreed solutions that would make road safety a
              priority in order to cut down on fatalities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the matter is being examined from the
              wrong angle. Should we not try to reduce the volume of traffic
              instead of trying to accommodate it? Should we not try to improve
              driving standards and to cut down speeding on the Bangor to
              Belfast road? Ms Morrice spoke about that issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that the Minister for Regional
              Development is with us today. I am sure that he will listen to
              what I have to say on this issue. Modest investment in the A20
              from Portaferry to Newtownards would improve road safety on that
              road. The experts tell us, however, that many people in a similar
              situation will give up the use of their cars if they are provided
              with an acceptable, reliable and dependable form of public
              transport. We should seek to have improved bus and rail services
              that the public could have more confidence in, and which would
              surely stop many drivers from killing themselves and, indeed,
              killing or injuring others, through excessive speeding and lack of
              attention when using this very busy road.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Safer driving and a lighter volume of traffic
              would benefit everyone, and those goals are attainable. On behalf
              of my Colleague Eileen Bell, I fully support every effort being
              made by the Minister and the Department for Regional Development
              to provide a good safe passageway on this road, thereby saving
              lives.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Boyd:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I am not a Member for the North Down
              constituency, I would like to make a few points, because I travel
              along the road regularly, having relatives in Bangor.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The dangers of the Belfast to Bangor road are
              well known. Many people use the road to travel to the north Down
              coast, which is a popular area for day trips, especially at Easter
              and during the summer months. However, the road is, sadly, only
              one of many in Northern Ireland that has accident black spots and
              many fatalities. My sympathy goes out to all those who have lost
              loved ones on our roads. However, in listening to the debate and
              what has been said about greater use of public transport, I think
              that there is some hypocrisy, given that most Assembly Members use
              cars. I take the point, but traffic volumes will not decrease —
              if anything, they will increase.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, the Patten Report on policing
              has had a detrimental effect on policing resources. Recently,
              there have been reports that the police traffic branch for the
              Greater Belfast area, which includes the Belfast to Bangor road,
              will be cut back. This decimation of police traffic branch
              resources will, sadly, almost certainly result in more accidents
              on the Belfast to Bangor road and on many other roads. Driving
              standards will deteriorate on all roads throughout Northern
              Ireland due to a lack of on-the-ground policing. We need adequate
              policing resources to police our roads properly and to catch those
              drivers who are intent on careless and reckless behaviour, and who
              endanger not only themselves and their passengers but also all
              road users.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The penalties for motoring offences are
              hopelessly inadequate, particularly for those who are guilty of
              causing death or serious injury. Several constituents who have
              lost loved ones have contacted me in the past few years, and I am
              sure that most Members have come into contact with relatives who
              have lost loved ones as a result of careless or reckless driving.
              Their pain is then compounded when those who are guilty of causing
              the deaths receive totally inadequate sentences. In some cases
              they receive only suspended sentences. Sentences must be tougher,
              and magistrates must be provided with the necessary legislation to
              deal with such offenders.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposer of the motion, Ms Morrice, is
              quite right in saying that the speed limit is too high on
              stretches of this road. However, the speed limit must be enforced
              to reduce the speed. The greatest deterrent is to have a visible
              police traffic branch presence on the road. I have travelled on
              the Belfast to Bangor road about six times in the past couple of
              months and, through no fault of the police, I have yet to see a
              police vehicle sitting by the roadside. Unfortunately, there will
              be more accidents and fatalities on that road, and elsewhere,
              unless more resources are put into the police traffic branch,
              rather than reducing its resources.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I congratulate the Member for North
              Down, Ms Morrice, in securing an Adjournment debate on this
              subject. I thank her for raising the matter and for bringing it
              before the Assembly. It is a matter of considerable importance in
              its specific content and in the general issue that it raises.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise to Ms Morrice, as my Colleague
              Sammy Wilson indicated that he would like to take part in the
              debate. I regret to inform the House that his mother passed away
              at lunchtime today. I am sure the House would like me to convey
              its condolences and sympathy to him and his family.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure the House that road safety is one of
              my Department’s top priorities. I am fully committed, along with
              the Roads Service and other agencies, to doing all that I can to
              reduce the number of people killed and injured on our roads. I
              assure the House that I take the views expressed seriously, as
              well as the suggestions that have been made. I will give an
              initial response to some of those issues; however, the Department
              will have to look at some of them, particularly at a technical
              level. I hope, in due course, to respond more fully to Members who
              have raised specific points.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was aware that the timing of today’s debate
              was significant to the Member for North Down, Ms Morrice, as it is
              almost a year since her friend was tragically killed in an
              accident on the Belfast to Bangor road. I extend my condolences to
              the family and to Ms Morrice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was somewhat disappointed by the Member’s
              speech. It lacked one important ingredient: recognition that there
              are causes of accidents that have nothing to do with roads or the
              conditions thereof. That was rectified in the speeches of Mr
              McCarthy and Mr Boyd. I want to place on record, although I shall
              not comment on it as the matter is sub judice, that someone will
              be appearing in court as a result of the case that was the spur to
              Ms Morrice raising the issue, and there will be an attempt to
              prosecute for driving without due care and attention.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a different number for fatalities,
              although that is not the key issue — it depends on where one
              believes the Belfast to Bangor road starts and ends. However, of
              the six fatalities that I am aware of in the three years mentioned
              by the hon Member, every one was the fault of the driver of a
              vehicle. Inattention, diverted attention, excessive speed and
              driving without care are causing the accidents. People, not roads,
              cause accidents. That was missing from the hon Member’s speech.
              She said that &quot;we have the power to change the
              situation&quot; — if the &quot;we&quot; is the community as a
              whole, I agree, because it ultimately comes down to the people
              behind the wheel as to whether we can change it and the impact
              that we can have.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Taking the advice of the Member for North Down,
              Mr McFarland, I will speed up at this stage to place on record
              what the Roads Service has done on the Belfast to Bangor road. It
              is a main arterial route into Belfast, and it has a two-way
              traffic flow of almost 40,000 vehicles per day in some sections.
              Therefore, it is an important trunk road and commuter route.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Safety along that route is of particular
              concern. Therefore, the Roads Service has been active in carrying
              out several schemes, specifically directed at improving road
              safety, over the last year or so. I hope the House will allow me
              to outline some of these schemes, indicating the work undertaken.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, high friction surfacing has been applied
              to almost all the signal-controlled junctions along the route,
              including the Sullivan Place and Shore Road junctions in Holywood,
              Tillysburn and, most recently, the Ballysallagh Road junction near
              Bangor. High level cantilever traffic signals were replaced, and
              additional signal heads on high poles have been provided at Cultra
              Station Road and Station Road, Craigavad. Safety improvements to
              prevent right- turning accidents have been undertaken at two
              junctions on the dual carriageway between Holywood and Belfast.
              Significant lengths of cycle track have been provided from
              Tillysburn to Holywood and from Ballygilbert to Springhill, near
              Bangor. We have resurfaced one and a half miles from Cootehall
              Road to Springhill, which has improved the skidding resistance of
              the road surface.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The urban traffic control system has been
              extended to cover 10 signalised junctions on the A2. The system
              continuously monitors the traffic signals for faults 24 hours a
              day, seven days a week. Maximum efficiency is ensured by altering
              the traffic signal timings to cater for the variety of traffic
              flows throughout the day. We have installed closed-circuit
              television cameras to monitor traffic flows at three additional
              junctions. The timings of traffic signals at Seahill junction were
              altered to create gaps in the traffic flow for the benefit of
              residents turning right at the nearby Larch Hill junction.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In January last year, we installed speed camera
              traffic signs along the entire route to support the police
              campaign of an increased level of speed enforcement on the road,
              in a bid to reduce the level of accidents.</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was interested in the Minister’s remark
              that it is people, not roads, who cause accidents. He went on to
              list a host of actions carried out to make roads safer. Will the
              Minister not agree that safer roads can prevent accidents?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are steps that we can take and have
              taken, to control people’s behaviour and how they drive. I will
              address the specific issues raised by the hon Member. I also want
              to talk about some further safety improvements in the pipeline.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Roads Service officials have been developing a
              solution to the road accident problems at the junction of Rathgael
              Road and Old Belfast Road. That junction has the worst history of
              road accidents on the A2. The Roads Service has commissioned
              consultants to undertake a traffic study on the A2 Bangor ring
              road, Rathgael Road and Balloo Road. As a result of that study,
              junction improvements including the installation of traffic
              signals will be carried out in the forthcoming financial year, at
              a cost of £200,000. Roads Service also plans to resurface a
              section of road between Whinney Hill and Ballygrainey Road in the
              year 2002-03, at a cost of £600,000. That will contribute to road
              safety by maintaining good skidding resistance on the road
              surface.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the longer term, as Members will be aware,
              my Department is developing a regional transportation strategy.
              Safety is one of the strategy’s five key objectives, with an
              estimated outcome of a reduction in accidents of 5% from the
              current level. During the discussion on the regional
              transportation strategy, the Member who tabled the Adjournment
              debate today missed the point that without the intervention
              contained in the strategy, accident rates would be expected to
              rise by 14% over the current level by the year 2012. We are
              planning for a reduction under the strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The outworking of the regional transportation
              strategy will be through transport plans that will make more
              specific proposals for the actions illustrated in the strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bangor corridor is being dealt with through
              the preparation of the Belfast Metropolitan Transport Plan. That
              work involves the consideration of transport corridors, including
              the Belfast to Bangor route. Investigations will be carried out,
              using a multi-modal-study approach and the resultant
              recommendations will include measures for improving public
              transport and the road network in the Greater Belfast area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a truism in the Member from Strangford’s
              comments about paying more attention to getting people off the
              roads and into other modes of transport, rather than having to
              deal with the impact of greater traffic flows. The Belfast to
              Bangor route seems to be ideally placed for that, in light of the
              investment that is being made on the railway. There is a new
              station; new track is being laid; and new trains are coming onto
              that line. Undoubtedly, that improved service should attract
              people to use an alternative mode of transport. I hope that the
              Member will encourage her constituents to do so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The basic argument that I have advanced is that
              the Department has provided a new, completely modernised station.
              I was there about a week ago. The Department is currently
              providing new track, and I hope that that will be completed soon.
              It has already set the contract for 23 new trains. I do not think
              that anyone could have expected the Department to progress so far
              in the short space of time since devolution.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not an immediate solution. However, if
              the hon Member wants an immediate solution, she has not provided
              any to the House today. The proposals that she has put forward
              will take even longer than what I have suggested.</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How long will it take to change the speed limit
              to 40 miles per hour?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order, order.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not a case of simply throwing out a
              suggestion and believing that, automatically, because the figures
              on a pole along the Belfast to Bangor road are changed, that will
              make a difference to the behaviour of drivers. A reduction of the
              speed limit would not necessarily mean that there would be any
              driver improvement. By and large, drivers who cause accidents are
              not the ones who obey the speed limit restrictions on roads.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the proposed measures will be used to
              inform the statutory process — to develop the Belfast
              metropolitan area plan, which is being led by the Department of
              the Environment. The draft area plan is due for publication at the
              end of the year. I hope that I have demonstrated the Department’s
              promotion of improvements on the Belfast to Bangor road,
              particularly over the past year or so. I assure Members that I
              will continue to give high priority to road safety engineering in
              the future, on that route and on others, as far as is practical
              and affordable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to deal with some of the specific issues
              that were raised during the debate. Ms Morrice made reference to
              erecting what she described as a &quot;crash barrier&quot; —
              which, I believe, departmental officials refer to as a
              &quot;central safety fence&quot;. She may not be aware that any
              type of central safety fence or barrier must be set back from
              passing traffic by a certain minimum distance. The width of the
              barrier, together with the minimum distance required on both
              sides, amounts to a significant part of the central reserve —
              normally an absolute minimum of two metres.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That would require the removal of one of the
              four existing lanes, which would result in a catastrophic loss of
              capacity and severe congestion. Alternatively, the carriageway
              could be widened by the width of one lane, but reference has been
              made to the likely cost and disruption that would be caused by the
              acquisition process.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What about the cost of the deaths?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the hon Lady would allow me to address the
              issue, I could then deal with the other matters that follow from
              it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apart from the cost, and the disruption that it
              will cause to her constituents in that area, the installation of a
              safety fence will impede private access along that part of the
              route. Unlike modern dual carriageways, there is insufficient
              space in which to do a U-turn at the next available public road
              junction.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.45pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even if we were to contribute to the cost
              involved, using such a proposal to resolve some of the issues
              would give rise to a further safety hazard at another point along
              the road. Road engineers and safety experts must take account of
              the overall capacity of the road and the likely result of any
              measures they take.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Right turns were mentioned. One of the hon Lady’s
              Colleagues has been exercised about a right turn into the Culloden
              Hotel. My officials were willing to accompany her to speak to the
              hotel proprietors about the issue. From the Department’s point
              of view, having no right turn would encourage people to use the
              traffic lights a little further down the road. My officials are
              still willing to talk about it, but the hotel owners will have a
              strong view on it. If a right turn were banned, the hotel owners
              would appeal against it. The issue is not as simple as it might
              first appear.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A new road was suggested, and the cost
              difficulties of such a road were discussed. We are dealing with
              the regional transportation strategy and the area plans.
              Ultimately, the Assembly would have to fund such a route. If we
              looked for a track for such a road in the Craigavad/ Cultra area,
              there might be an objection or two, thereby prolonging the
              process. I hope that the rail network would have new trains
              running by the time that process would be completed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having given an off-the-cuff response to many
              of the issues that the hon Lady raised, I will consider them in
              more detail. I sympathise with the need to control speed. My
              personal belief is that it is an issue of enforcement. I told her
              Assembly Colleague so when she and my Colleague, the Member for
              South Belfast, discussed the Saintfield Road area with me.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One permanent speed camera will do more to
              reduce speed than many rumble strips and other features that my
              Department could implement. Ultimately, whether people feel that
              they can get away with breaking the speed limit determines how
              hard their foot goes on the pedal. I must agree with the Member
              for South Antrim that enforcement becomes a key issue. As a result
              of political exercises, the police do not have the manpower to put
              a car on the road to slow traffic on the Belfast to Bangor road,
              or on any other roads around the country.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have driven many times in other parts of the
              United Kingdom. One difference in areas where there are great
              problems in enforcing speed limits, is that there are constant
              reminders of speed limits that drivers cannot ignore. Drivers may
              look at the road in front and not see the signs beside them, but
              large circles on the road reinforce the speed limit. I have asked
              my Department to consider that measure. While I think such
              measures might be useful in reinforcing the message, road and
              safety engineers might have other reasons to suggest that they are
              not advantageous and might do violence to the overall principle of
              road safety.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House would be doing a grave disservice to
              the people of Northern Ireland, particularly those touched by
              tragedy of road accidents, if it perpetuated the myth that road
              accidents can be eliminated only by better roads. Any road safety
              professional, whether among traffic police, road safety educators,
              the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) or
              highway safety engineers, will say that the best way of cutting
              accident numbers is for each road user — particularly drivers
              — to take a personal responsibility for using roads safely. Road
              users can do that by keeping to an appropriate speed, driving with
              due care and attention, using seat belts and following the adage
              &quot;Don’t drink and drive&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, my Department will do what it can to
              improve the sites where there are accident clusters and where
              steps can be taken to control drivers. It is right to do that, but
              it is not realistic to expect that highway engineering alone is
              the answer to the scourge of road accidents.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I am sure that the House will
              join me in supporting the police, who must enforce the road
              traffic laws, and in exhorting all road users to take personal
              responsibility for road safety.</p>
