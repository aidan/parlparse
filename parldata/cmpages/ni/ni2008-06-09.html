		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. The legislative framework that brought about  the establish&shy;ment and restoration of the House &mdash; the Good Friday Agreement and  the St Andrews legislation &mdash; requires that  there should be equality for all peoples in the North of Ireland. Given the  recent comments by Mrs Robinson, does the Speaker consider that the matter  should be referred to the Standards &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member should take her seat. The Member is out of order, and she  knows it &mdash; that is not a valid point of order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Speaker. Given the public statements that were made during  the past week with reference to the approach that the First Minister may take  to the discharge of his duties on equality and good relations, particularly  where the gay and lesbian community in Northern Ireland is concerned, has he  sought an opportunity to address the House to clarify his position and that of  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That is not a valid point of order.</p>

		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Referral of a Ministerial Decision to the Executive  Committee:<br>
	        Environmental Protection  Agency</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I inform Members that on Monday 2 June, I received a valid petition to refer a  ministerial decision to the Executive Committee under section 28B of the  Northern Ireland Act 1998. The petition related to the decision by the Minister  of the Environment not to establish an independent environmental protection agency,  as notified to the Assembly on Tuesday 27 May. Having consulted with the  parties &mdash; in accordance with the Act and with Standing Order 27A &mdash; I have  certified that the Minister&rsquo;s decision relates to a matter of public  importance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On Wednesday 4 June I referred the decision to the  Executive Committee for consideration, by way of a letter to the First Minister  and deputy First Minister. When I am notified of the Executive Committee&rsquo;s  decision, I will announce it to the Assembly at the earliest opportunity.</p>

		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Suspension of Standing Orders</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have been advised that the Minister of the Environment, Mrs Arlene Foster,  will move the motion on behalf of the Executive.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That Standing Orders 10(2) to 10(4) inclusive be suspended  for 9 June 2008.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before we proceed to the Question, I remind Members that the motion requires  cross-community support.</p>

		    <p class="H4StageHeading">British-Irish Council: &nbsp;Social Inclusion Meeting</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure that he  wishes to make a statement regarding the outcome of the British-Irish Council  social inclusion meeting.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr Poots)</strong>: The third ministerial meeting of the  British-Irish Council (BIC) social inclusion group was hosted by the Welsh  Assembly Government in the Senedd, Cardiff  on 20 May 2008. The meeting focused on the challenges presented by child  poverty &mdash; particularly the issue of lone parents &mdash; in the eight member  Administrations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The British-Irish Council was established under the  agreement that was reached in the multi-party negotiations in Belfast in 1998, and it provides a forum for  its members to exchange information, discuss, consult and use best endeavours  to reach agreement on co-operation on matters of mutual interest, within the  competence of relevant member Administrations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The meeting was chaired by Dr Brian Gibbons AM, the Welsh  Assembly Government&rsquo;s Minister for Social Justice and Local Government. The  British Government were represented by the Rt Hon Stephen Timms, the Minister  of State for Employment and Welfare Reform; the Irish Government were  represented by Mr Gerry Mangan, the director of the Office for Social  Inclusion; and the Scottish Government were represented by Mr Stewart Maxwell  MSP, Minister for Communities and Sport. Minister Murphy and I attended on  behalf of the Northern Ireland Executive; the Isle of Man was represented by Mr  Dudley Butt MLC, the political member for the social services division of the  DHSS; Jersey was represented by Senator Paul Routier, the Minister for Social  Security; and Guernsey was represented by Mr Al Brouard, the deputy Minister of  the Social Security Department.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We discussed the recent developments on social inclusion in  the Administrations and focused, particularly, on issues relating to child  poverty. The group had an interesting discussion on the projects that were con&shy;tributing  most to progress in that area, and it reviewed the successful work that is  being carried out by the BIC&rsquo;s social inclusion group on child poverty &mdash; with a  focus on lone parents, since that theme was chosen in 2006.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ministers noted the range of definitions that are used  in that field and the comparison of statistics across the BIC region. We also  acknowledged the findings of the literature; a review of the existing evidence  based on tackling child poverty, particularly among lone-parent households; and  the key challenges met by member Administrations. Furthermore, we commended the  examples of good practice in tackling such challenges.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We considered the merits of each of the four potential new  areas of interest to be taken forward by the BIC social inclusion group: older  people in long-term care; homelessness and affordable housing; the voluntary  and community sector; and migrant workers. We agreed that the work over the  coming year will focus on the contribution of the voluntary and community  sector in promoting social inclusion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The work carried out by the officials will continue to seek  to strengthen and consolidate the ongoing co-operation and exchange of  information experienced in best practice between member Administrations. The  National Assembly for Wales  presented a paper on child poverty. The Ministers welcomed and noted that the  next ministerial meeting will take place in Scotland; and further details are  to be confirmed.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McElduff)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an r&aacute;iteas seo agus gabhaim  bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My question emanates more from my involvement in the  Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister than  it does my chairmanship of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure. As part  of the OFMDFM Committee&rsquo;s inquiry into child poverty, the Committee has been  examining the relevant issues.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">OFMDFM furnished us a copy of the report last week. Will  the Minister say what action the Executive plan to take to ensure that the  report leads to improve&shy;ments in policies and actions to tackle child poverty,  including, for example, joint initiatives with other Administrations? We  welcome the report and statement, but where is the action plan for the Executive?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Executive remain committed to dealing with,  and tackling, the issues. We will continue to work with other Administrations  in the British Isles. The Department for  Social Development (DSD) will take the lead in developing our plans for  tackling poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  (OFMDFM) also has a key role to play. It has a unit that is dedicated full-time  to the issue of child poverty. Therefore, the Executive will make the case to  the Assembly for adequate support, funding and recognition, and they will do so  through the Department for Social Development and OFMDFM.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  At its launch in November 2006, &lsquo;Lifetime Opportunities: Government&rsquo;s  Anti-Poverty and Social Inclusion Strategy for Northern Ireland&rsquo; set a target of  halving child poverty by 2010-11, and its complete eradication by 2020. Will  the Minister state whether those targets are being met and remain achievable?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Those targets remain achievable across the UK. I am  interested in a proposal that the UK Government are considering. That  proposal is to guarantee that anyone who is coming off benefits and going into  employment receive at least &pound;50 a week more than they did while on benefits.  That would assist a considerable number of people living on benefits.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement, and for its focus on the eradication of  child poverty. The statement said that the voluntary and community sector would  be looking to eradicate poverty and promote social inclusion. Given budgetary  constraints, and how other funding is being diverted towards meeting the  challenge of the Olympics, how does the Minister intend to support the  voluntary and community sector?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On the subject of social inclusion, will the Minister  comment on what has been said by his DUP colleague, Mrs Robinson, on the  lesbian and gay community? Her comments further isolate that community.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I deplore Mrs Kelly&rsquo;s attempt to introduce a  matter that has no relevance to the issue under discussion. The Member&rsquo;s  behaviour demonstrates how little interest she has in social inclusion, child  poverty and the voluntary sector.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Other regions in the United   Kingdom, the Republic  of Ireland, the Channel Islands and  the Isle of Man look to Northern    Ireland for its voluntary-sector expertise,  which has been built up over many years, mainly through European funding.  Reduced financial support from Europe means  that the voluntary sector faces challenges. The Government will try to help  where we can, but many projects must become self-sustainable or face being  discontinued, because the funding just does not exist.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Members are reminded that this is an opportunity to ask questions on the  Minister&rsquo;s statement.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Older people and their long-term care are  among various issues on the work programme. Bearing in mind that the Executive  have failed by totally excluding free personal care from the Programme for  Government, will the Minister, through the BIC &mdash; and particularly the Scottish  Executive &mdash; get free personal care for older people in Northern Ireland back on  to the agenda?</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Member will be glad to know that I raised  the issue of elderly people, especially the difficulties that they currently  face, given their static budgets and the rising costs of living &mdash; in  particular, the rising cost of home heating and food. It was agreed that, as  part of the review that is being conducted on the voluntary and community  sector, we will consider how that sector can contribute to the well-being of  older people.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. I am delighted to note the four new  areas that the Council will consider in the future. Given that my colleague  Kieran McCarthy has just asked about the Council&rsquo;s role in its deliberations on  older people, I want to raise the growing problem in Northern Ireland &mdash; and right  across the United Kingdom and these islands &mdash;regarding migrant workers &mdash; that  is, the role of migrant workers, the conditions under which they work and their  housing problems. Will the Minister specify whether the issue of migrant  workers, and the problems that assail those persons, will be considered by the  Council in the future?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The issue of migrant workers is one of the  topics that was considered for the next discussion group. Unfortunately, only  one topic could be chosen, and, on this occasion, the voluntary and community  sector was selected. We recognise that migrant workers in Northern Ireland and Great Britain comprise a  significant population. That brings its own problems, which we need to deal  with and be aware of to ensure that immigrants can expect a reasonable quality  of life and standard of living.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I also thank the Minister for his statement, and I realise that he is speaking  in his capacity as a member of the Executive and respresenting the Office of  the First Minister and deputy First Minister. Will the Minister state what  information has been exchanged among representatives of the United Kingdom  Government, the Scottish Government and the National Assembly for Wales that we  could beneficially use given that the Committee for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister is currently conducting an inquiry into  child poverty? Next week, the Committee will present a report on that inquiry  to the House, and any available information would be very handy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During the Minister&rsquo;s statement, he mentioned the fact that  the National Assembly for Wales  presented a paper on child poverty in its Administration. Will the Minister  indicate what targets that Assembly has set, whether they are rigid and, if so,  whether they are achievable?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister referred to the future work programme and help  for those of a certain age, as well as the issues of homelessness and  affordable housing. Will he state when those issues will be presented to the Assembly  and to the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister, through the British-Irish Council?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: There are common problems and challenges in all  Admin&shy;istrations. We must explore such issues, and, in order to align policy  and delivery, we share information and report on issues such as access to  affordable childcare, in-work poverty, partnership and joint working with local  government and other stakeholders. Study visits and good practice have been  valuable to officials, and there are some successful, innovative interventions  that OFMDFM, as well as other Departments, can examine more closely and  possibly implement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Other Administrations have also been learning from us. For  example, initiatives such as the work being conducted on benefit uptake by the  Department for Social Development are being shared with the Scottish  Government. An anti-poverty strategy is currently being reviewed by Ministers  before it is circulated to the Executive. In the development of that strategy,  Northern Ireland Departments can examine successful projects from other  jurisdictions and consider what may be appropriate for us to implement. When we  are determining the way forward, we will, of course, take account of the  recommendations in the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister&rsquo;s report.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That ends questions to the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure. The House can  take its ease for a few minutes as we await the arrival of the Minister for  Regional Development.</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="5"></a>Regional Development Strategy</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister for Regional Development that he  wishes to make a statement on the regional development strategy.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. I apologise for being slightly late.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My statement marks the start of our review of the regional  development strategy (RDS). I want the review to be an inclusive one which will  hear, and benefit from, a wide range of views and options.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we have differing views from time to time, we are  united by our stewardship of the North, and we have a responsibility to our  children to step back from the day-to-day management of Government and consider  what we want for the North in the longer term. What sort of place do we want  our children to inherit, and how many people will live here? How do we help to  grow our economy? Where do we want our children to live, work and play? What do  we mean by regional balance, and how can we work towards it? How should we  respond to climate change? How can we obtain the most benefit from investment  in our infrastructure? How do we position ourselves in a North/South,  east-west, European and world context? Finally, how do we better respond to the  speed of change around us?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those questions take us beyond the time frame of our  Programme for Government, so a long-term vision, within which all our actions  can fit, is required. A vision without clear direction on how to achieve it is  not worth the paper it is written on. Our vision must include clear and  strategic direction on how it can be achieved by numerous small steps now and  in future years. That is the role of the regional development strategy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My Executive colleagues and I have discussed and agreed the  need for a fundamental review of the regional development strategy. The new  strategy will be different: it will be relevant to key stakeholders and  flexible enough to deal with changing circumstances, yet robust enough for  decision-making; it will set priorities and list a selected number of key  infrastructure projects that are essential for economic growth; it will take  account of, and be relevant to, structures and functions that emerge from the  review of public administration; and it will take account of the many changes  that are happening around us.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The speed of change is what strikes me: standing still is  not an option. We must embrace change and be part of influencing and guiding  our future. Ours is a growing population: population projections show growth  greater than had previously been expected. By 2012, we will have a population  of over 1&middot;8 million in the North, and it is possible that it could exceed 2  million by 2030. However, where people choose to live is changing. Years ago,  many people fled Belfast  due to fear that was caused by intimidation and violence. Between 1995 and  2005, the population of Belfast  fell by almost 25,000 to 268,000 &mdash; a drop of more than 7%. In that period, all  other council areas experienced population increase.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For a time, Belfast  was one of the greatest cities in these islands, and it should be our goal to  make it great again. The success of the North depends on that. A strong Belfast is not a threat  to other areas. For many years, we have argued over the allocation of funding  to Belfast at  the expense of other areas. There is an imbalance in the infrastructure between  east and west, which I am addressing through investment in roads and rail.  However, we must get away from the narrow sectional debates and look broadly at  our region. We must examine how our cities, towns, villages and countryside  areas support and interlink with each other, and how they are all important.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We need a discussion about what regional balance means and  about how we unlock our potential to grow as a region.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the different political perspectives, that may be a  difficult issue for us to tackle. However, it is an issue that we cannot, and  should not, duck. I am determined to lead the debate, and, in doing so, will  set the tone for a mature debate that is evidence driven and that will benefit  the people of the North.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The original regional development strategy recognised the  role of Derry &mdash; the regional capital of the north-west, a city with over 90,000  people, which sits on a magnificent setting on the banks of the Foyle, and  which has a rich and long history &mdash; for the first time. I want to develop that  even further.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have endorsed the cross-border work in the  north-west and have recognised the linkages between Donegal, Derry,  Limavady and Strabane. Joint investment by both Governments in the airport, in  the road that links the north-west to Dublin,  and in dualling the road from Derry to beyond  Dungiven are but some of the projects that link the north-west better with the  island as a whole. How can we maximise the potential of those projects? How can  we attract more investment to the north-west? Those are just some of the issues  that the review of the regional development strategy will consider.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the south-east, the city of Newry has seen amazingly strong growth in  recent years. Ideally sitting, as it does, between the two main cities on the  island &mdash; Dublin and Belfast &mdash; it has benefited from that economic  corridor. Like Derry, it is developing its cross-border linkages with Louth and  Dundalk, recognising the potential of working  together. Again, I want to explore how we can support and develop the further  growth of Newry and its surrounding area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Stretching north from Newry, places such as Banbridge,  Craigavon, Dungannon, Cookstown and Magherafelt have experienced strong  population and economic growth in recent years. Together, those council areas  have experienced a population growth of more than 9%, which is well above the  regional rate. The strong growth of that band, which runs through the middle of  the region, brings with it new issues about the delivery of services and  infrastructure.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Further west, Omagh has also performed strongly. The  development of the A5 and A4 will open up new opportunities for Tyrone and  Fermanagh. My role is to ensure that we maximise the potential of that  investment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In speaking about the different areas, there is always the  risk of offending some people by leaving out their area. The people in the  areas that I highlighted are no more important than people anywhere else. One  aspect that makes this land so special is our settlement patterns: we have  strong links to land and to place, and a more dispersed settlement pattern than  other areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">While that is what makes us so special, it brings with it  challenges. It makes us heavily dependent on the car. Year by year, more and  more cars are driven on our roads. Between 1992 and 2006, the number of cars  increased by 80%. There are now 800,000 cars on our roads; more journeys are  made within the region and beyond; people commute further and further to jobs  and schools; and there are more routes to new destinations from our airports.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">How do we manage such growth? For example, how do we  improve access to our ports and airports, which are so important to an island  economy? Part of the answer, undoubtedly, is better roads. Increasingly,  though, we also need to focus on public transport. We need to think about  reducing the need to use a car by better planning of where homes, schools and  shops are built, and of where jobs are available. I am also initiating a review  of the regional transportation strategy, which will consider such issues in  detail.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The environment and our response to climate change will  influence all our actions now and in the future. We are privileged to live in a  place with a rich, natural environment, including the Causeway Coast, Rathlin  Island, the Mournes and the lakes of Fermanagh, to name but a few. Our approach  to the environment needs to find a balance between protecting it and unlocking  the potential for tourism.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Increasing demand for new homes, sometimes in unsustainable  locations, more cars on our roads and increasing demand for energy all impact  on our environ&shy;ment. Transport is a key contributor to carbon dioxide  emissions: there has been a 41% increase between 1990 and 2005. We are already  doing much to improve and protect the environment, but, can we do more?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Before setting out a new approach to regional development,  I will make some comments on the existing regional development strategy. It was  the first regional spatial plan produced in England,  Scotland, Wales and the South.  In many ways, it set new approaches that were later applied in those other  jurisdictions. At that time, it was recognised as a best-practice document, and  it reflected the emerging European thinking on planning for regional  development. It is something that we can rightly be proud of, but time moves  on, and it is time for change.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I inherited from the direct rule Administration a five-year  review of the strategy, which considered the need for detailed adjustments, but  did not address the principles in the regional framework. The results of that  review are adjustments to some aspects of policy on economic development,  tourism and rural areas. That work will be published this month.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The five-year review was not a fundamental assessment of  the strategy. For timing reasons, the opportunity did not exist to take account  of significant issues that have emerged recently and that influence how we plan  for the future. Such issues include higher than expected population levels; the  need for more houses; climate change; and how to plan to maximise the use of  existing infrastructure and facilities in our cities and towns.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that although many of the policy directions in  the existing RDS are still sound it has not had the influence that was anticipated.  That was due to a combination of factors, including insufficient detail and  clarity on matters such as housing need, rural development, and the growth of  cities and towns.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There has also been criticism over the use of housing  figures in the strategy. Many see them as unnecessary for, and restrictive to,  forward planning. Others want some indication of housing need, but in a way  that better reflects local need and the growth potential of particular areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to better understand the contribution that rural  areas make to regional success and how we can support the cities, towns,  villages and countryside beyond Belfast  and the north-west to prosper and grow.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The RDS can only be delivered through the plans and  programmes of individual Departments and agencies. I do not see the RDS as a  Department for Regional Development (DRD) strategy, but as one for all of  Government and beyond. Many of its policies are being taken forward through  development plans prepared by the Department of the Environment (DOE). However,  for a variety of unforeseen reasons, the roll-out of the development plan  programme has been slower than hoped, and the rate of impact of many RDS  policies has suffered.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is now an opportunity to learn from experience and to  prepare a new regional development strategy that is fit for purpose and takes  account of recent emerging trends that affect how we plan for the future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With the unprecedented levels of expenditure we plan to  make over the next five to 10 years, we have an opportunity to influence this  land much more than previous generations did. More than &pound;3&middot;5 billion will be  spent on transportation alone. That is our challenge and our responsibility to  future generations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am conscious of the need for this major review to be  concluded quickly. It is essential that new policy directions are developed to  a point where they can inform the next investment strategy, which is planned  for 2009. Although the review is planned to take up two years, I will assess  ways to shorten the process where possible. I am, however, very aware of the  need for involvement from all Departments and key stakeholders, which will take  time.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The timetable is challenging. I have set up a number of  groups to take the review forward. The Executive have agreed to a ministerial  subgroup; and the first meeting with ministerial colleagues is due to be held shortly.  I am also keen to benefit from the considerations of the Committee for Regional  Development, which received an initial briefing on 28 May.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have also reformed an interdepartmental steering group of  officials at a more senior level and I welcome Departments&rsquo; commitment to that  approach. The first, and very constructive, meeting of that group was held on  28 May. I have also extended the membership of the external working group,  which provided important input to our work on the five-year review.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are other important initiatives, which I will take  into account. The DOE is undertaking a reform of the planning process, and I  will meet Minister Arlene Foster to discuss the important relationship between  the RDS and development plans.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also fully aware of the need to take account of  structures emerging as part of the review of public administration. Although  regional planning and policy statements will remain a central Government  function, it is clear that the relationships with local planning and  development management must be structured in an efficient and effective way.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The strategy deals with a wide range of environ&shy;mental,  social and economic matters. It affects the working of all involved in regional  development. I am therefore aware of the need to consult widely and  effectively. I want to ensure that this is managed in a way that allows the  timely emergence of revised policy to inform budgetary and investment  decisions.</p>
		    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I said at the start of my statement that we needed a  long-term vision within which our actions can fit. That vision must include a  clear strategic direction about how it can be achieved. My aim is to produce a  revised regional development strategy that can accommodate the economic growth  now expected in the medium-to-long term. That means a strategy that sets  directions for the location of jobs, houses, businesses, public services, and  facilities across the whole region.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The strategy must seek to make Belfast a great city once more, build on the  significant opportunities for growth in the north-west and its hinterlands, and  provide connections for North/South and east-west development.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It must better recognise the role of all cities, towns,  villages and the countryside, and how they all support and work together with  one another. That approach may include identifying key regional projects, which  are considered essential for balanced economic development.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In dealing with all those issues, the RDS must set out a  clear high-level vision for the North. It will have a strategic focus. It must  be an aspirational document, setting out the actions needed to translate the  vision into reality. It will focus on the development of regional significance,  including population, environmental issues, telecommunications, housing,  economic development, and infrastructure developments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It must be an enabling document that sets out the  interventions required of the Executive to make that happen. It is not a DRD  document; rather it should become the Executive&rsquo;s spatial strategy and plan.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The RDS is a means to an end; it is not an end in itself.  It must concern implementation, and the actions and priorities necessary to  deliver the vision. It must set out how connections could be made to deliver a  more sustainable future development.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It will play a key role in informing how places are shaped  and developed at a local level. The review is, clearly, a very challenging and  timely piece of work that gives us the opportunity to shape the future of the North  over the next 20 years. I look forward to working with my ministerial  colleagues and the Assembly as the work develops. Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Regional Development (Mr Cobain)</strong>: The Minister will be  aware of the Committee&rsquo;s interest in the relationship between brownfield sites  and greenfield  sites. To that end, will he explain how he intends to ensure that the maximum  amount of development in our cities and towns takes place in brownfield sites  rather than greenfield  sites?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I thank the Chairperson for his remarks. The existing  regional target &mdash; for 60% of additional houses to be built in existing urban  areas &mdash; has been successful. That figure has been exceeded since the RDS was  adopted in 2001.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">While the potential for building in urban areas may change  over time, it is right to maintain the current approach, so that the potential  for building houses in appropriate locations in existing urban areas is maximised.  However, it must be recognised that building more houses in urban areas must  respect the need to protect the character of residential areas. In that context,  Members will be aware that &mdash; as part of the five-year review of the RDS &mdash; I  have changed the definition of &ldquo;brownfield development&rdquo; to exclude gardens.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Regional Development (Mr Wells)</strong>: Members  will have noted with interest the Minister&rsquo;s statement on this important issue.  In particular, they will have noted the concentration on Londonderry  and &mdash; surprise, surprise &mdash; Newry. There is a concern that the revised RDS will  concentrate resources into areas west of the Bann.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister assure Members that resources and  infrastructure will be distributed evenly across this part of the United Kingdom,  with no particular bias towards any city or town?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: If the Member listened carefully &mdash; as I am sure he  did &mdash; he will have noticed that I mentioned every county in the North and most  of its major towns.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive recognised the imbalance in regional  development and set the task of redressing that imbalance as part of the  Programme for Government. The rewritten regional development strategy provides  a very clear opportunity &mdash; to which all Members will be given an input &mdash; to do  what the Executive recognised, which is to redress the regional imbalance.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a  r&aacute;iteas. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, and his commitment to areas west  of the Bann in particular. Does the Minister think that the RDS will help to  end regional imbalance?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: In itself, the RDS cannot deliver regional balance,  but it sets out the framework and actions that are required to achieve balanced  growth throughout the North. That must address the important role that Belfast has as the  regional economic driver, and how all parts of the North can benefit from that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Derry city has a  significant role to play in creating a prosperous north-west. Equally, it is  important that the economic potential of district towns &mdash; some of which act as  gateways &mdash; is maximised. The RDS has a role in setting out how those component  areas can best be developed, and the priorities required to deliver growth. I  am also considering the possibility of identifying regional projects that are  required to deliver regional prosperity in the areas of infrastructure,  development, energy, telecommunications and tourism.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  The Minister told us that the RDS is only a strategy, and not a means to an end  &mdash; we accept that. However, does the Minister agree that there are serious outstanding  deficits in the north-west? Derry is the only  city that is not linked to the capital city by a decent rail service. In  addition, it is the only city that is not linked to Belfast by a proper motorway. Above all, the  town of Dungiven  has the highest carbon dioxide levels of anywhere in these islands. Does the  Minister agree that additional finances are urgently needed to address those  imbalances? I am sure that Mr Wells would be happy to support those basic human  rights.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: We have identified the finances that are needed to  support those connections. As the Member is very much aware, I lifted the  investment ban on the railway line between Coleraine and Derry.  Money is being spent on the line between Belfast  and Ballymena.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have identified a substantial project to improve the  service between Belfast and Derry &mdash; especially  the morning service into Derry city &mdash; and we  have brought forward the plans for the A5 and A6, including the bypass at  Dungiven. The money and resources have been identified for all those projects.  The importance of the north-west, and Derry&rsquo;s  role in the north-west as an economic driver, is recognised. Derry&rsquo;s  port and airport are also recognised as key features, and resources have been  identified to support them.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comment on the definition of brownfield sites. The  statistics in the RDS form a major part of the evidence base that supports long-term  planning for public-sector capital investment in infrastructure. Those facts  diverge from what is happening on the ground, due mainly to the area plans not  having flowed in sequence. What action will the Minister and his counterpart in  the Department of the Environment take to ensure that there will be a smooth  transition between area plans in order to make sure that runaway speculative  development does not shape the nature of development in our cities?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I have scheduled an early meeting with the Minister  of the Environment to discuss those matters. The regional development strategy  is a high-level Government document that refers to the region as a whole and to  where the Government would like to see development. Area plans then follow on  from the regional development strategy. The Minister of the Environment has  initiated her own review of the planning process, so it is important to ensure  that the strategies dovetail.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The previous regional development strategy was a huge  document, but its impact on planning and development was not as expected. When  drafting the new document, we have an opportunity not just to take into account  new issues that have become more important, such as the environment, imbalance  and other such matters, but an ability &mdash; with a functioning Executive &mdash; to  ensure that there is a read-across through all Departments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The review will take place on several levels. For example,  there will be a ministerial subcommittee that will involve others besides the  Minister of the Environment and me. A high-level group of civil servants from  every Department has already met, and I was pleased with the seniority of the  people in that group and with its commitment to the process. An external  working group also exists, and that will bring in influences and ideas from  outside Government. There is a real opportunity to ensure that a joined-up  Government approach is taken to the strategy and that the Department for  Regional Development does not simply produce a document to see whether other  people recognise it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, I hope to produce an Executive document  that will guide regional planning. Other strategies will then flow from that  document.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I welcome the fact that the Minister&rsquo;s statement has ensured that the review  will take us beyond Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s 2016 united Ireland fantasy and that the  Minister accepts that Northern Ireland will be part of the United Kingdom for  the long term.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister referred to the need to better recognise the  role of our cities, towns and villages, and he considered population growth in  places such as Banbridge and Craigavon. Will the Minister turn his attention to  seeking assistance for towns such as Lurgan, which have had the heart blown out  of them by terrorist bombs and have suffered economically ever since? Will he  also prioritise infrastructural improvements to reflect population growth in  places such as Lurgan, Banbridge and Portadown?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Whatever the constitutional future &mdash; and that is  still up for question &mdash; we will still need to develop the region and we will  still need good policies to govern that development. We will still need  regional development strategies, whether the future is in an all-Ireland  context or in the current restrictive political context within which we now  operate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Part of the current strategy recognises clearly the  all-Ireland links that have developed substantially over the past few years. It  is ludicrous to talk about the development of Derry in isolation from the  development of the north-west as a whole, including Letterkenny and other parts  of County Donegal. Similarly, it is ludicrous to  talk about the development of Newry without involving Dundalk and County Louth.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked about Lurgan and other towns. It is clear  that a central band of towns has experienced significant growth, and Craigavon  Borough Council covers one of those areas. One of the weaknesses that was  identified in the previous document was that it focused on Belfast.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It provided, for the first time, some degree of focus on  the north-west and on Derry&rsquo;s role, but it was  less focused on the rest of the North. The strategy offers the opportunity to  refocus on all areas; not by trying to be all things to all people and giving  everyone a nod, a wink and a mention, but by refocusing on development and  identifying the areas in which the population is concentrated, and assisting  them to achieve their potential for growth. Part of the strength of the new  approach is that it will involve all Departments, which ensures that any plans  will be co-ordinated.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  detailed statement, and I welcome his recognition of the growth in the  mid-Ulster towns of Dungannon, Cookstown and Magherafelt. Will he examine the  fact that there is, unfortunately, no linkage road, as the A29 does not link  the three towns? Does he accept that, in the past, the RDS was not flexible  enough to respond to the number of new homes required for the local and migrant  populations? How will he address the issues of equality? In particular, how  will he deal with the decentralisation of Departments to rural areas, such as  mid-Ulster?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: If I could achieve all that, I would be very popular.  The weakness of the last strategy document was that it did not have the  required flexibility when the predicted population growth was exceeded. The  document included housing-growth indicators and, in some areas, became a bar to  development, rather than allowing development in areas to which people were  trying to relocate due to the availability of jobs. Therefore, the RDS must be  a more flexible document.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The housing-growth indicators have been a thorny issue, and  perhaps there is scope for new thinking on that. Rather than trying to curtail  development in certain areas, we should identify areas of increasing population  and determine what must happen to support that. Development must be sustainable  and not damage the character of any area, but the housing-growth indicators  have a restrictive &mdash; rather than an enabling &mdash; influence. In many ways, the  Department views the development of the document as enabling &mdash; rather than  restricting &mdash; development. All development will be subject to new equality  impact assessments that will consider how to balance development throughout the  North and between east and west.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: In  Newry and Armagh, which is my constituency and that of the Minister, there is a  wealth of small and medium-sized rural businesses, many of which not only  supply the Northern Ireland  market, but export to countries throughout Europe.  The Minister will accept that such businesses play a vital role in the rural  economy of Northern Ireland,  but does he accept that the infrastructure of roads in many rural areas  requires vast improvement to assist existing businesses and encourage continued  growth in the rural economy?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I accept that, if the resources were available, the  roads in all rural areas could be improved. However, limited resources force  the Department to prioritise the roads that are used most. I accept that,  throughout rural areas, small and medium-sized enterprises sustain the  population in many ways. The Member is aware of the downturn in farming in  recent years, and more people are turning to small businesses to enable their  families to continue living in rural areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive&rsquo;s central focus is on economic growth, not  only through large inward-investment projects, but by supporting local economic  growth and small and medium-sized enterprises. Francie Molloy also made a good  point about rural roads, and my Department tries to employ the limited  resources in the best way possible. With an awful lot more money, we could do a  great deal more, but we are restricted by our budget.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  As the increasing dependence on cars and the growing demand for energy are  having an impact on the environment, how will the regional development strategy  bring about the required sea change, particularly the reduction in carbon  emissions?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: That can be done, provided that a long-term view is  taken. Although carbon-emission levels in other sectors are declining, they  have risen by 40% in the transport sector &mdash; it is the one area in which a  significant increase in carbon emissions has occurred, and that is damaging. It  is a long-term trend about which we must do something.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past 10 to 15 years, the commuter belt around Belfast has widened. The  population is increasing further south, west and north of Belfast,  whereas there has been a reduction in the population of Belfast itself. That means that more people  are travelling in and out of Belfast,  because that is where a huge number of jobs in the North is located. Therefore,  more commuting takes place, and from greater distances. That contributes to an  increase in carbon emissions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Several factors must be taken into account. One factor  concerns where jobs are located and where development is happening; another  concerns public transport, in which it is clear that significant investment is  required. The predictions are that, in the next 30 to 40 years, 40% of the  population of Ireland will  live on the east coast, in the corridor between Belfast  and Dublin.  That will raise some significant issues for commuting and transport. Therefore,  the regional development strategy, which looks beyond current budgetary  planning and investment-strategy planning, must identify, as far as is possible,  emerging trends. It must also identify what needs to happen in future in order  to try to reduce carbon emissions and make a real contribution to the  environment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a  r&aacute;iteas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his statement, in particular his  reference to Newry&rsquo;s growth. Last week, we discussed the importance of a  southern relief road in the further development of Newry, and I am sure that  that will be included in any future strategy. As a point of information, my  support for a southern relief road does not imply opposition to the Narrow  Water bridge project, as the Minister seemed to think was the case last week.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that the possibility of enhancing  the growth and development of Armagh city &mdash;  including better cross-border infrastructure &mdash; must be explored? Can he confirm  whether a much stronger North/South element will be a central theme throughout  the revised regional development strategy? Will the strategy lend support to  such cross-border projects?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: To answer the Member&rsquo;s final question first &mdash; yes.  The purpose of rewriting the regional development strategy is to take account  of new developments, and one key development is the much stronger North/South  linkages. I said that Derry and Newry&rsquo;s  association with the border meant that they could not be considered for  development in isolation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked about Armagh  city. We want to consider development potential right across the board, and if  there was a weakness in the original strategy, it was that no specific focus  was placed on areas outside Belfast and Derry. Places were labelled as hubs on maps &mdash; when I last  visited Armagh City  and District Council, councillors wanted to know whether Armagh  was still a hub. I told them that it was, but that did not mean very much. Armagh may be described as such on a map, but what does  that mean? What development flows from that description? Rather than to try to  be all things to all people, and to give everybody a mention, we want a  regional development strategy that works. Central to that are North/South  linkages, because that is where the development potential lies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">People have &mdash; foolishly &mdash; joined one camp or another over  the issues of a southern relief road and the Narrow Water bridge project. I  make the point that every time Mr Bradley&rsquo;s counterpart and namesake gets up to  flog the merits of the bridge project, someone else gets up to promote the  road. Mr McCallister asked me last week whether I was signed up to building a  southern relief road, because that was in the develop&shy;ment document. However,  the Narrow Water bridge project can also be found the development document.  Like the Member&rsquo;s party colleagues, I was happy to sign up to the document, and  that means support for both projects, as Mr Bradley rightly says.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement  and I thank him for it. He stated that the approach that is taken to the  environment must seek a balance between protecting it and unlocking its  potential for tourism. The main stumbling block to the development of tourism  is poor roads infrastructure. Will the strategy ensure that tourism will be  given the same priority as the rest of industry? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: One element of the strategy is, obviously, to reflect  the Executive&rsquo;s Programme for Government. There is no point in having a  regional development strategy that is at odds with the Programme for  Government, a central aim of which is to grow the economy. Tourism development  is one of the key sectors in the North and, I am sure, throughout the island.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members raised the point about roads. With its  current budget, the Department will continue to struggle to provide the type of  roads that people believe that the North deserves. That is why there must be  prioritisation to try to develop key transport corridors &mdash; the roads on which  there is most traffic. Had the Department received a much greater allocation  from the Treasury, which it was able to spread as best it could across all  other roads, there would be a much better roads network. The Department will  continue to do all that it can with the resources that is has to try to improve  the roads network.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If the regional development strategy, which dovetails with  the Executive&rsquo;s Programme for Government, recognises that growth of the economy  is at the programme&rsquo;s centre and that tourist destinations are vital for  economic growth, the strategy will obviously reflect the need to resource and  support that development.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  The Minister has referred several times to the importance of cross-border  development and to Londonderry and Newry. Most  people would concede that those cities are important, particularly because of  their international linkages with the country that is immediately adjacent to Northern Ireland.  People will want there to be progressive development in those areas. However,  will the Minister not turn his mind to &mdash; and deal with &mdash; the fact that, right  across Northern Ireland, as an entity, people want development to be focused  towards the particular transportation needs of communities? They want the  concentration of effort and the review of the RDS to focus on ensuring that  resources are deployed accordingly.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I accept the Member&rsquo;s comments. I assure him that  that is the way that the Department intends to approach the matter &mdash; to spread  its resources as best it can. I believe that there is general recognition in  the Executive &mdash; people may choose to differ &mdash; that there has been an infra&shy;structure  deficit between the east and the west. In areas of the north-west and, I am  sure, in the Member&rsquo;s constituency of East Derry and other rural constituencies,  there is certainly a need for improved infrastructure.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the importance of the major city of Belfast &mdash; and  of Derry for the north-west region &mdash; has been recognised as an economic driver,  the role of rural areas, their contribution and the need for connectivity  between them was not adequately reflected in the current RDS.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Interestingly, the Member picked up on the strategy&rsquo;s focus  on North/South elements. It also focuses on east-west elements. Recently, I had  the opportunity to meet the Minister who has responsibility for transport in Scotland to  discuss the linkages between Larne and the roads around Loch Ryan. The Member  will be aware that the First Minister, the deputy First Minister and I met the  First Minister of Scotland at last week&rsquo;s launch of the new Stena Line terminal  in Belfast.  Again, we discussed the links between Belfast  and Scotland, which are  becoming hugely important, as is the connection through Scotland to mainland Europe.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  In seeking to grow the economy in the way that the Minister has outlined, and  in drawing attention to Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s rich natural environment and the  potential of its major tourist attractions, surely emphasis must be placed on  ensuring that it is able to outcompete its nearest neighbour. Why has the  Department not made a single mention of Lough Neagh&rsquo;s rich natural environment  and massive tourist potential?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: As I said in my statement, I am sure that, although  the Department has mentioned a range of areas, it will have left some out. If  Lough Neagh has been left out, it is not because its potential is not  recognised &mdash; it certainly is recognised.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not see the issue in narrow terms as a competition  with the South. If the development in Derry  and Newry are anything to go by, the lessons are of co-operation, development  of mutual strengths and of attracting more business together.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The South attracts many more tourists and international  visitors than the North does. Perhaps the Member&rsquo;s approach is to compete,  rather than to work to ensure that the island as a whole enjoys the full  benefit of international visitors who seek the tourist product.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the case for Lough Neagh will be well made.  Today we launch what will be an exhaustive and extensive consultation and  discussion with Executive colleagues, senior officials from all Departments,  external advisers, the Committee for Regional Development and the Assembly as a  whole. Members will have many opportunities to stress the importance of their  particular interest. The fact that Lough Neagh was not mentioned in my  statement does not mean that it is not considered to be a key resource. After  all, it is located smack in the centre of our region.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement, during which he urged the need for better  transport links to and from ports and airports. Belfast  International Airport,  which is located in my constituency of South Antrim,  requires better public-transport links. Is the Minister still of the opinion  that to build a railway link to Belfast International Airport is not  economically viable, despite the fact that only a couple of miles of track  would be needed in order to link with the old Knockmore line? Has he considered  building a guided bus lane to that airport? Such a regular service would get people  who travel to the airport in their cars out of them.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: It is interesting that a high-level discussion about  the development of the region ends up as a discussion about local roads, but  that is fair enough during an open question-and-answer session.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Transport accessibility to airports and ports is a focus of  the review of the regional development strategy. I have discussed road links  with those who run Belfast   International Airport,  and they consider that issue to be of primary importance. We have also  discussed the rail link, and it is viewed as being economically viable. If  there were to be an opportunity to reassess the development of the region,  those priorities might change.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said in my statement, and given that we are an island  economy, access to and from the island, including the linkages to ports and  airports, is a key area to be examined. Many of the major roads projects that  are being undertaken, such as the Westlink upgrade, projects in the north-west  and that for a southern relief road, are concerned with port and airport  accessibility. The focus on that will increase as the level of traffic  increases, and the form of travel used to get to and from all the airports  changes, most notably that to and from Belfast International Airport.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Minister rightly said that Belfast  is a driver for the regional economy. In addition to considering the overall  distribution in Northern Ireland,  will the strategy also consider how Belfast  can best have the critical mass to compete at European and international level  when it comes to being a major city? Does the Minister recognise that it may be  best to think of Belfast  not only as a city but as a wider city region, which encompasses the suburbs?  That would ensure adequate distribution of jobs.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: If the Member had seen some of the statistics that we  have seen, he would know that, compared with other areas, much more than the  lion&rsquo;s share of jobs &mdash; those jobs at the higher end of the scale &mdash; are located  in Belfast and those council areas that form  greater Belfast.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My statement recognised that Belfast is the central driver for the region.  The population of Belfast city centre has  reduced over the years, and we must consider whether that depopulation is good  for Belfast. It  leads to much more commuting and creates more congestion on the roads. Along  with propositions such as that for a rapid transit system for Belfast,  consideration must be given to how, through the development of genuine  brownfield sites, the population of Belfast  might be increased. Such big, key strategic matters must be considered.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, many people thought that the  Belfast-and-Derry-versus-the-rest argument was divisive. We must get beyond  that by shaping a regional development strategy that best recognises Belfast&rsquo;s importance as  well as the development potential of other towns and villages. Such development  can support the region&rsquo;s and the island&rsquo;s economy.</p>

	        Supply Resolution &nbsp;for 2006-07 Excess Vote</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have been advised that the Minister of the Environment, Mrs  Arlene Foster, will move the next two motions and the First Stage of the Budget  (No. 2) Bill on behalf of the Executive.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Since the next two motions relate to Supply resolutions, I  propose to conduct only one debate. I shall ask the Clerk to read the first  motion, and I shall then call the Minister who shall move that motion. Debate  will then take place on both motions. When all Members who wish to speak have  done so, I shall put the Question on the first motion. I shall then ask the  Clerk to read the second motion into the record and the Minister to move it  before putting the Question without further debate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to four hours  and 30 minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 45 minutes  to propose and 45 minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who  wish to speak will have 10 minutes.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly approves that a sum, not exceeding  &pound;7,184,270,000, be granted out of the Consolidated Fund, for or towards  defraying the charges for Northern Ireland Departments, the Northern Ireland  Assembly, the Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland  Commissioner for Complaints, the Food Standards Agency, the Northern Ireland  Audit Office and the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation for the  year ending 31 March 2009 and that resources, not exceeding &pound;8,474,916,000 be  authorised for use by Northern Ireland Departments, the Northern Ireland  Assembly, the Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland  Commissioner for Complaints, the Food Standards Agency, the Northern Ireland  Audit Office and the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation for the  year ending 31 March 2009 as summarized for each Department or other public  body in Columns 3(b) and 3(a) of Table 1.3 in the volume of the Northern  Ireland Estimates 2008-2009 that was laid before the Assembly on 30 May 2008.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The following motion stood in the Order Paper:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly approves that a sum, not exceeding  &pound;7,224,593.19 be granted out of the Consolidated Fund for or towards defraying  the charges for the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety &ndash;  Health and Personal Social Services Superannuation, for the year ending 31  March 2007 as summarized in Part II of the Statement of Excess document that  was laid before the Assembly on 30 May 2008. &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [The Minister  of the Environment (Mrs Foster).]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: It is with some trepidation that I move the motions tabled  by the Minister of Finance and Personnel. These important Supply resolutions  seek the Assembly&rsquo;s approval of the spending plans of Departments and other  public bodies for 2008-09 and its approval to provide excess cash to the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) for 2006-07.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I request and recommend the levels of Supply that are set  out in the resolutions under section 63 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, which  provides for the Minister of Finance and Personnel to make recommend&shy;ations to  the Assembly, leading to cash appropriations from the Northern Ireland  Consolidated Fund.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The first resolution, relating to the 2008-09 Supply, is  based on the first year plans of the Budget 2008-2011, which was approved by  the Assembly on 29 January 2008. However, as Members are well aware, Budgets  set spending plans, but do not, in themselves, convey cash or resources to  Departments or give them the legal authority to spend cash or use resources.  That is done through Assembly approval of the Supply resolutions, the Estimates  and the associated Budget Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The first resolution seeks the Assembly&rsquo;s approval to issue  a cash sum not exceeding &pound;7&middot;2 billion from the Northern Ireland Consolidated  Fund and the use of resources not exceeding &pound;8&middot;5 billion for 2008-09.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The amounts of cash and resources that are covered by the  first resolution are in addition to the cash and resources voted on account for  2008-09 in the Budget Act (Northern    Ireland) 2008, which was passed by the  Assembly in February. Those amounts will complete the total provision of &pound;12&middot;5  billion and &pound;15 billion of resources required for 2008-09 by Departments and  other public bodies, as detailed in the Main Estimates volume, which was laid  before the Assembly on 30 May 2008. The public services to be funded by those  allocations have been debated by the Assembly, both in the context of the  debates on the Executive Budget for 2008-2011 and the Vote on Account in  February.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The second resolution seeks the Assembly&rsquo;s approval on the  issue of a cash sum of &pound;7&middot;2 million from the Northern Ireland Consolidated  Fund, as detailed in the Statement of Excess, which was laid before the  Assembly on 30 May 2008. That issue was considered by the Public Accounts  Committee, which recom&shy;mended in its report that an excess vote should be  granted by the Assembly. The resolutions, once approved by the Assembly, will  be the precursor to the Budget No 2 Bill, which I hope to introduce in the  Assembly later today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly took steps along the legislative path with a  similar Budget Bill just one year ago. I hesitate to state that we, as Assembly  Members &mdash; or I, personally &mdash; are now all experts on the minutiae of the  Estimate volumes. Of course, some Members may be experts. I know that Members  will by now be familiar with the need, for logistical reasons, for accelerated  passage for Budget Bills.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For the financial year that commenced in April, Departments  are spending cash and using resources on the basis of a Vote on Account in the  Budget Act (Northern Ireland)  2008, which was passed in February. As that provided only initial allocations,  it is now essential that the further Budget Bill progresses through the  Assembly before the summer recess and receives Royal Assent by 31 July 2008.  The con&shy;sequences of not doing so would be that Departments would run out of  cash during the summer, which clearly would have devastating implications for  public services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At this stage, I acknowledge the assistance of the  Committee for Finance and Personnel in this matter. I understand that the  Committee has confirmed that there has been appropriate consultation with it on  the Main Estimates and the draft Bill and that it is content for the Bill to  proceed by accelerated passage. The Executive and I very much appreciate the  Committee&rsquo;s valuable contribution to the financial process and the scrutiny  role that it plays at each stage.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I stated earlier, the 2008-09 Main Estimates are based  on the first-year plans of the Budget 2008-2011, which was agreed in January.  However, since the final Budget in January, some technical adjustments and  departmental budget additions, regarding centrally held funding, have been made  in respect of issues that were not known or resolved at that stage. I hasten to  reassure the Assembly that those technical adjustments are routine and do not  change the spending plans that were approved by the Assembly in January.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members that Budgets are plans for wider  public-sector spending, including for arm&rsquo;s-length bodies, on the full range of  devolved services, while Estimates are restricted to departmental level, hence  the table in the yellow section of each departmental Estimate to assist the  reader to reconcile the Estimate to the Budget.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The first resolution before us today, which is supported by  the 2008-09 Main Estimates, represents the cornerstone on which this  legislative body not only sets limits on expenditure and the use of resources,  but holds Departments accountable for managing and controlling that spending  and use of resources within those limits authorised for that particular year.  In that vein, if a Department exceeds any of those limits, the Comptroller and  Auditor General, on examination of the accounts, will report the excess to the  Public Accounts Committee, which, in turn, will examine the reasons for the  excess and report the results of its examination to the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The second resolution arises from such an excess by the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety superannuation vote in  2006-07. A Statement of Excess was laid in the Assembly on 30 May 2008. The  excess cash requirement of &pound;7&middot;2 million arose from a failure to estimate accurately  changes in working capital and cash within the health and personal social  services superannuation scheme. As I mentioned already, the Public Accounts  Committee has examined that issue and recommended in its eighth report that the  necessary sum will be provided by an excess vote in the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is critical that Departments manage their resources and  cash within the limits that are approved by the Assembly, and a central plank  of good financial management is that those limits are based on taut and  realistic estimates.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the tightrope that Departments have to walk  between minimising underspend and ensuring that an excess does not occur.  However, we must be ever mindful that we are dealing with taxpayers&rsquo; money, and  that we have a responsibility, as custodians of the public purse, to ensure  that resources are managed efficiently and effectively. The public obviously  expect better from a devolved Administration, and we must deliver on financial  management.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Peter Robinson, now the First Minister,  rightly placed great emphasis on improving the quality of financial management  in Departments. I know that the new Finance Minister wants officials in the  Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) to continue to work actively with all  other Departments to that end. On his behalf, I urge Departments to avail  themselves of the training available for staff, especially non-finance staff,  in policy areas in order to ensure that decisions are taken with due regard to  financial consequences.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, the House received details of the provisional  out-turn for 2007-08. That statement highlighted many areas of concern for the  Assembly, and for my colleagues and I in the Executive in particular, with  regard to the continuing level of underspend on current expenditure. Eight of  the 11 Departments showed a position in excess of 2&middot;3% of planned spend. On the  capital front, six of the 11 Departments had underspends in excess of 12%. In  addition, two Departments overspent.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The trajectory of spend, in both resource and capital,  highlighted a significant uplift at the end of the year, which is a cause for  concern. I hope that my colleagues in the Executive take this message to heart  and, with the assistance of the Statutory Committees, ensure that that situation  is not repeated this year. The Finance Minister will be looking closely at  out-turn figures and the need to consider options for incentives for  Departments in order to improve their financial management.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Estimates that we are debating derive from the  Executive&rsquo;s first Budget. Agreeing and announcing plans, such as these Main  Estimates, is relatively easy. Delivering within those allocations will prove  more challenging. The public rightly expects delivery on the targets and  outcomes that were published in the Programme for Government, and the Executive  will be held to account for that delivery.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In implementing the Programme for Government, we have the  opportunity to strengthen the local economy, and to improve infrastructure and  public service. Performance against the commitments that were made in the  Programme for Government and public service agreements will be measured and  monitored to ensure and drive delivery. A key strand to that will be the  performance and efficiency delivery unit (PEDU), which has been working with  colleagues in the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  (OFMDFM) to develop the performance monitoring arrangements for the Programme  for Government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">PEDU is available to assist the Executive, Ministers and  Departments in ensuring that the commitments and targets that are set out in  the Programme for Government are realised. The focus of PEDU will, therefore,  be on the Executive&rsquo;s priorities and on where funding has not been translated  into the desired outcomes. I urge my Executive colleagues to avail themselves  of PEDU&rsquo;s support.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Improved public services must be delivered within the  available resources and with a focus on increased efficiency. It is not an  option simply to call continually, as some have done, for increased  allocations, which could be funded only by an increase in the tax burden on  households and businesses.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committees that scrutinise each Department will have a  key role. The role of Assembly Members and Committees is to challenge and  assist Ministers and Departments. It is also their role to hold Ministers and  Departments to account. Assembly Members and Com&shy;mittees have a vital role in  ensuring that Departments deliver on the Programme for Government targets for  improved services, and in driving out inefficiencies. That task should commence  immediately, and continue doggedly and persistently throughout the next three  years. We do not want to wait until the end of the current Budget period to  discover that Departments have not delivered on targets or that efficiencies  have not materialised.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I fully appreciate the enormous challenge that lies ahead  in developing a culture of delivery and efficiency across the public sector and  of growing a dynamic, innovative economy in the current tight fiscal  environment. It is a challenge that faces us all, and we must all play our  part: Ministers, Departments, accounting officers, Committees and Members of  the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The amounts of cash and resources sought in the Supply  resolutions are substantial on top of the Vote on Account. The Main Estimates  for 2008-09 break the total requirements down to a finer level of functional  detail for each Department. Although I am presenting the Estimates on behalf of  the Minister of Finance and Personnel, the underlying detail reflects decisions  taken by Ministers within delegated financial authority given by the Department  of Finance and Personnel. Therefore, although I will endeavour to respond in my  winding-up speech to as many points as possible, I hope that Members will  appreciate that I may be unable to respond in detail on individual departmental  issues. In those cases, I may refer the matters to the appropriate Ministers  for a response.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Minister of Finance and Personnel, I  recommend the Supply resolutions and ask for the support of Assembly Members  for the motions.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McLaughlin)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her statement and for  her brevity. I, too, will be brief in outlining the Committee&rsquo;s position.  Senior departmental officials briefed the Committee for Finance and Personnel  on 28 May 2008 and 4 June 2008 in relation to the Main Estimates for 2008-09  and the associated Budget (No 2) Bill, which gives legislative approval to the  Estimates. The Bill will be introduced in the Assembly following this debate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Advance copies of the Main Estimates were made available to  Committee members at the meetings. DFP officials also provided a helpful paper  to the Committee, which reconciled the figure work in the Budget to that which  is included in the Main Estimates. Following those briefings, on 4 June 2008,  the Committee for Finance and Personnel agreed to grant accelerated passage to  the Budget (No 2) Bill. The Main Estimates and the associated Budget (No 2)  Bill are the outworkings of the process to finalise the Executive&rsquo;s Budget for  2008-2011, which was agreed by the Assembly in January 2008.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Finance and Personnel published a report  in December 2007 when the Budget document was at draft stage. It included  substantive submissions from all the Assembly&rsquo;s Statutory Committees. The  Committee has since received a formal response to the report and is continuing  to monitor implementation of its recommendations, especially in relation to  measures to improve financial management in Departments. There was some reference  to that issue in the Minister&rsquo;s statement today, and, last week, Members gave  their opinions on the continuing problems.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The underlying spending plans for 2008-09 brought forward  in the Main Estimates reflect the position established in the first year of the  Executive&rsquo;s Budget for 2008-2011. Although the Budget for 2008-2011 has been  agreed, the Assembly and its Statutory Committees can have input into the  reprioritisation of resources in 2008-09 via the in-year quarterly monitoring  rounds.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee recently wrote to DFP highlighting the need  for Departments to brief Statutory Committees prior to making their monitoring  round submissions, as it has not been happening consistently hitherto. Therefore,  I hope that DFP takes the necessary steps to ensure that the issue is  addressed, including making provision for Committee scrutiny in its timetables  for monitoring rounds.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to return to an annual financial process as soon as  possible, as it gives the Assembly and its Committees maximum opportunity to  scrutinise and contribute to the Budget process. That will greatly enhance the  consultation process.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  The Member and his Committee did a great job in highlighting the importance of  Com&shy;mittees&rsquo; scrutinising Departments when it comes to in-year monitoring. Does  he know how many Depart&shy;ments have made figures available to Committees for  scrutiny for the June monitoring round?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Does he believe that only the Department of Education (DE)  failed in that duty by supplying the information to the Committee one day  before sending it to the Department of Finance and Personnel?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: I do not have access to all  Committees&rsquo; reports. My own Committee made a complaint, and several other  Departments failed to satisfy the commitments. We will ask DFP to address that  matter in order to encourage mature working relationships between Departments  and their Committees; that is a constructive and helpful process. For whatever  reason &mdash; and I can speak only for the Department of Finance and Personnel &mdash; the  relationship did not function on that occasion. However, the Committee received  an explanation, an apology and an assurance that it will not happen during  future processes, which I hope has occurred in all Departments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept the Member&rsquo;s point; it is vital to establish sound  working relationships. Sometimes, difficult decisions have to be made, and  those decisions have greater authority if the relevant Committee has access to  detailed information in advance &mdash; not to make the Minister&rsquo;s job more difficult  but to understand the rationale behind recommendations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">DFP officials are considering Budget processes to ensure  that, in future years, we have earliest possible sight of the indicative  information on which the Executive will develop their spending projections.  Moreover, the Committee for Finance and Personnel is considering whether an  inquiry on that matter is necessary and hopes to be able to outline recommend&shy;ations  to the Minister soon.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Finance and Personnel forwarded all the  information on the excess vote for DHSSPS for 2006-07 to the Committee for  Health, Social Services and Public Safety for its consideration. The  Comptroller and Auditor General reported on that matter, and it was the subject  of an investigation by the Public Accounts Committee. That Committee  recommended that the excess requirement of &pound;7&middot;2 million should be provided by  the Assembly through an excess vote. Therefore, on behalf of the Committee for  Finance and Personnel, I support both motions. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  The Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel correctly  highlighted several issues that should be given particular consideration by the  House. As the Minister mentioned, bringing this matter to the House is  difficult. The finance issue &mdash; whether personal or related to Northern Ireland  &mdash; is huge, and it is important that we understand how to engage with the  budgetary process.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The programme of work for Statutory Committees in the  Assembly should include a clear identification of methods to scrutinise how  Departments prioritise and spend finances. The Chairperson of the Committee for  Education already mentioned the difficulties encountered by his Committee when  that information was not supplied. Furthermore, the Chairperson of the Com&shy;mittee  for Finance and Personnel referred to problems with the lack of information  given to the Committee in order to allow it to offer meaningful input.  Ministers will, undoubtedly, want to engage fully with the Committee that has a  statutory responsibility to scrutinise them and their Departments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, if we are to believe that that is to be the case,  the Ministers and the Departments have a duty and a responsibility to prove it,  and to furnish the relevant Committee with information in a timely manner so  that we can see how that money is being prioritised and how the bids for that  monitoring round have been highlighted.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel  spoke about a return to an annual financial process. We all have concerns about  accelerated passage, not only with respect to the Budget, but for other Bills  that have been presented to the House. As a legislature, we must not use  accelerated passage as a quick fix or as a way to circumnavigate certain  situations. There are times, when, unfortunately, it has to be used. However,  the financial processes of the House will be improved if the financial  timetable is such that the Committees and the House can scrutinise the Budget and  the financial arrangements and management of Departments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister mentioned the training that would be provided  by DFP for the Departments and their staff. I suggest that it might also be  advantageous for that training to be extended to Members. There is a huge  amount of learning and experience that we should seek to acquire when it comes  to accurately and effectively dealing with budgetary issues. I support the  motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: As  the Minister said, the Budget was agreed in January 2008, and today&rsquo;s vote is  part of the technical process that gives legislative authority for that  expenditure. I thank the departmental officials who recently briefed the  Committee for Finance and Personnel on the technical adjustments that have  occurred in the Budget report that has been presented to us in the Main  Estimates booklet.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The officials pointed to some additional Peace II funding  and some transfers of functions among Departments. Superannuation funding has  been transferred from annually managed expenditure to the system of  departmental expenditure limits, and all Members would agree that some  additional background information on such issues would be useful. However, we  trust that our civil servants, who have been trained and have the  responsibility for those areas, and are taking the right decisions. There are  concerns about the additional the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development (DARD) funding, and an extra &pound;266&middot;9 million for Northern Ireland  Water, which was indicated in the Budget but now appears in the departmental  expenditure plans.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are a number of questions to be asked about changes  that have occurred in the detailed Estimates, some beyond the control of the  Assembly and the Civil Service. For example, will the plans of the capital  realisation task force be affected by the changes in the property market? In  our plans, we have proposed to sell off certain assets in order to reinvest and  create assets that are required. Will there be any long-term implications for  that policy as a result of the changes in the property market? Can the capital  investment plans be delivered, or will they have to be curtailed as a result of  the likelihood of reduced funding from the sale of assets?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">How will the recent disclosure of the dramatically reduced  value of the DARD asset at Crossnacreevy be affected? I was shocked to learn at  the weekend that an asset that had been valued at &pound;200 million is now estimated  to be worth about &pound;6 million.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That change in value creates a significant black hole, and  difficulties may arise from the &pound;194 million shortfall. Will &pound;90 million still  be available to fund the farm nutrient management scheme, which is essential if  we are to meet the European directive&rsquo;s requirements? How will that scheme be  funded? How did such an overestimate of the value of a Government asset occur?  There has been a failure of huge proportions. How will other  capital-expenditure plans be affected by the shortfall?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During the debate on the draft Budget, the under&shy;funding of  children&rsquo;s services was highlighted. Other Members and I welcomed the fact that  additional moneys were made available in the final Budget for projects that had  been funded previously by the Executive programme fund for children. I was  disappointed to discover subsequently that many laudable projects in areas of  need have been awarded reduced funding. Some projects, such as breakfast and  after-school clubs, have not been awarded long-term funding at all; they have  not been mainstreamed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that, at this stage, in-year monitoring is  likely to be the mechanism used to try to address some of those issues. However  &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Does the Member agree that that is not only a question of the overall Budget  that the Executive allocate, but also of departmental prioritisation? Breakfast  clubs are, essentially, the responsibility of the Department of Education. If  the Department were to reprioritise and target at breakfast clubs some of the  money that it wastes in other areas, there would be sufficient funding for  them.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  fully concur with the Member&rsquo;s point. When additional moneys were made  available, I thought that they would go to the many laudable projects that have  had positive results. Such projects address areas of need by giving young  people a step onto the educational ladder and providing additional childcare,  which, perhaps, enables parents to return to work and give their children a  positive model of working to better their families through their own efforts. I  was disappointed to find that such projects remain under threat.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As yet, there has been no ministerial announcement of plans  to deal with the children&rsquo;s funding that had been channelled through PlayBoard  to benefit some 57 projects and 2,800 children in areas of need. I should have  thought that most people recognised the importance of early-years learning and  the fact that giving our young people that additional step on the educational  ladder is hugely significant. Perhaps the whole area of funding early-years  education has somehow become lost in the more divisive education debate that  has taken priority.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  As recent publicity surrounding PlayBoard has targeted the Department of  Education, the Member may not be aware that it has since come to light, via  departmental officials, that funding for PlayBoard is the Department of  Health&rsquo;s responsibility. It is hoped that that Department will make a more positive  announcement about PlayBoard later this week.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Member has just illustrated the strange ways in which our Departments and  Ministers work. The junior Ministers assured the Assembly that, as a result of  the allocation of additional funds, projects that had previously been funded  under the children&rsquo;s fund would not be at risk and should not suffer. It is  entirely wrong that Ministers should argue. Rather, the junior Ministers, who  have responsibility for children&rsquo;s issues, should bring together the relevant  people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member said that PlayBoard is the responsibility of the  Department of Health. It is clear that responsibility for childcare was  transferred to the Department of Education in 2006. There is no great benefit  in having arguments across the Chamber. The main issue is that, in removing  children&rsquo;s funding from the central funding body, the legs have somehow come  off the stool. The Department of Education has not accepted its responsibility  for childcare or made it a priority, and funding from the children&rsquo;s fund has  come to an end.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Long-term childcare funding must be resolved in a manner  that assists our children. Verbal disputes across the Chamber or attempts at  political point-scoring do not benefit those children. I want the matter to be  resolved in a fashion that provides long-term benefits and better life  opportunities for children and parents in areas of need. That would contribute  to a reduction in child poverty, because education can benefit everyone.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  The Member will be pleased to hear that at a recent meeting of the Committee  for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, it was made  very clear that the Department of Education has responsibility for childcare.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Member illustrates the need for the Executive to sort things out. If there  is no clear way of identifying responsibility, let the junior Ministers resolve  the matter. The Executive could create a new central funding mechanism to  enable resolution to take place. If that spares the blushes of those Ministers  who missed this element of funding, I will be content, as long as the funding  continues; that is most important. I am thankful that the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety&rsquo;s Estimate ensures that there will be three  month&rsquo;s funding for those childcare projects, even though childcare does not  fall under its departmental responsibility.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  support the Supply resolution for the 2006-07 excess vote. We should pay that  sum and hope that such a failing does not occur in the future.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  We are debating the finances for this financial year. The Assembly will not  have forgotten the concerns that I and my party expressed in the debates on the  Programme for Government and the Budget. I will repeat those concerns and,  indeed, emphasise some of them because it is clear &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  It is very early in my speech, but I am always prepared to give way.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Does the Member&rsquo;s party support its Minister wholeheartedly, given that that  Minister went through the lobbies with the rest of the Members of the House and  voted for the Budget? She did not take the same cowardly stance as her party,  which abdicated its responsibility and voted against the Budget.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention and, indeed, it will do no harm to  clarify the matter. My party has no concerns on this issue. This form of Government  requires Ministers to behave in a particular way, which the Minister for Social  Development did. My party was totally united in its stance. We had serious  concerns about the Programme for Government and the Budget and we still have  those concerns.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Good government is not just about money; we need a coherent  system of government that is joined together and has a shared approach. Is that  what we witnessed in last week&rsquo;s events? Within OFMDFM, Sinn F&eacute;in has, for some  time, been very unhappy with the outcomes of government and its domination by  the DUP.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Last week, we saw the OK corral behaviour of Sinn F&eacute;in Members. They rode their  horses up to the corral, but then &mdash; having looked into the eyes of those  opposite &mdash; quickly turned and high-tailed it out of town. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we can see the comedy in what happened, we are  entitled to ask whether that bodes well for future Government here or for the  coherent government that we need.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have major concerns over the ability of those two  parties to deliver a coherent strategy of Government based on a shared society.  As I said, we expressed our concerns previously about aspects of the Budget.  Other Members of my party will detail that, but I want to headline some of  those concerns.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are concerned about the extent to which the Budget is  predicated upon efficiency savings. As those begin to work through, we see  major concerns from around the community about cuts in front-line services &mdash;  only today, we see significant representation from trade unions that have come  to this place to voice their concerns.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In our education system, we are seeing the biggest change  to secondary education for decades &mdash; if the Minister ever gets there. There is  no budgetary allocation in relation to that, and there is no greater clarity on  the policy resolution of that issue than there was when we debated the Budget.  That is a major worry in the community among primary-school staff and among  parents. It is not credible that such a dramatic change will be cost-neutral,  and we are entitled to question the Budget on that issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The extended schools programme has been debated, and it is  absolutely vital that the disadvantaged get a good start on the educational  ladder. The Minister of Education has said that she has not had the budget for  that and that she has gone repeatedly to the Minister of Finance and Personnel  and that money has not been made available.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member accept that that is not accurate? The Minister of Finance and  Personnel has clarified that on those occasions when the Minister of Education  asked for additional finance, additional money was given.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue has not been that the DFP Minister has refused to  give money; the issue has been the inability of the Education Minister to  prioritise in a way that is to the best advantage of the educational system.  That was proven by the fact that in the monitoring round, the Minister gave &pound;50  million back to DFP.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  The Member makes valid points as to the use of money within that Department,  but the fact is that money was not available to continue that very necessary  programme.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I was referring to asset sales and how vital they are to  the Budget. In the current context of changes in property values, that is  uncertain, and it is difficult to be confident in the Minister&rsquo;s &mdash; or the  former Minister&rsquo;s &mdash; assurance that all is OK on that front.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will mention one or two the Department for Social  Development (DSD) issues &mdash; not to the detriment of other Departments &mdash; but  clearly money for housing &mdash; social housing in particular &mdash; is hugely dependent  on asset sales. That includes the problem that is now making itself  transparent, which is the drying-up of Housing Executive house sales.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Fuel poverty is a greater problem than it was five or six  months ago. We are facing a winter of even higher fuel prices, and it is not  going too far to apply the word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; to what is ahead of us; it is a real  crisis in many homes, and it is imperative that the Executive address that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must say to central Government in Westminster that there  needs to be an increase &mdash; and a substantial one &mdash;in the winter fuel payment.  All parties need to do what they can there, but we should do what we can within  our own sphere of control &mdash; to put it simply, more money must be put into the  warm homes scheme.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a huge and unresolved problem in relation to water  charges. There are clear concerns that the Minister is going for a separate  water bill and a very big one &mdash; up to &pound;950 when those charges are fully  realised. There will be no consistency in charges for identical water usage  between two houses. The system is fundamentally unfair. There is a real worry  among those who are on fixed, low incomes about the further burden that is  evidently coming their way.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have concerns about the quality of much of our  governance. We face a major challenge, and that needs the highest quality of  government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I refer Members to an interview in yesterday&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sunday  Independent&rsquo; with Professor Brendan Drumm, the chief executive of the Health  Service Executive. I recommend that article to any student of government.  Professor Drumm discusses how best to create a well-working health system, but  his comments range wider than that. Health is of huge importance, and accounts  for 50% of our Budget. It is a vital and emotive issue. The title of the  article is:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about more beds or more money, it is about  accountability&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Brendan Drumm addresses how to get the best out of the  money that is invested in our public services &mdash; and there are few greater  questions for the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Clear evidence is provided in the article that one unit in  the Health Service can perform dramatically better than another, sometimes with  less financial input. There is a need for a more efficient structure, based on  clear chains of accountability. That opens the major issue of where  accountability should rest &mdash; to what degree with professional managers, and to  what extent with our political system. There is a lesson for all good public  services: we must be able to create and support good, independent scrutiny and  management.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In that vein, I wish to express very grave concerns about  one recent ministerial decision: the refusal of the Environment Minister &mdash; or  should I say &ldquo;the then Environment Minister&rdquo; &mdash; to create an independent  environmental protection agency. The Minister saw the need for independence,  and she provided for some elements of independence, but did not go the whole  and absolutely necessary way of creating an independent agency. That was the  wrong signal to send out about the quality of government.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I have made a list of around seven areas that the Member has identified as  needing more expenditure, yet he is now going one step further and saying that,  in order to have what he calls &ldquo;quality of government&rdquo;, we should have an  independent environmental agency, which even its own supporters have said would  be costly to Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  will address Sammy Wilson&rsquo;s point later on. I believe that he is the incoming  Minister of the Environment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party has already made clear its major  concerns about public expenditure in general in Northern Ireland, and  specifically the Executive&rsquo;s first Budget. We voted against the Budget when it  was formally debated several months ago, and, as the formal process of turning  that flawed Budget into reality continues, we will once again state our objections.  If, however, my party does not force repeated Divisions, I must emphasise that  that should not be mistaken for consent.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to highlight some of the problems with public  expenditure in Northern Ireland. We are signing off on an annual Budget of &pound;16  billion &mdash; over half of that is due to be technically authorised today. Of that  &pound;16 billion, around &pound;7 billion comes through subvention from the UK Treasury.  We are dependent on external assistance for almost half of our expenditure. Our  local tax base is very small. The table set out in Varney II shows how serious  this issue is &mdash; not just in the context of the regions of the United Kingdom,  but internationally.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Our public sector is large, but our biggest problem is our  private sector, which is simply too small. It is right to give top priority to  growing our private sector. Although it is important to put into perspective  the size of our public sector, there are still major problems that we have to  confront.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In a wide range of aspects of life in Northern Ireland &mdash;  social, economic and environmental &mdash; our society does not keep up with new  demands by the Northern Ireland public for investments that are delivered  elsewhere. Clearly, there are major questions regarding the efficiency and  effectiveness of public expenditure. They include, but go beyond, the costs of  division; however, as you might expect, I will begin my speech on that theme.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party emphasises that major distortions of  public expenditure and opportunity costs arise from attempting to manage a  divided society, rather than from investing in high-quality shared facilities,  goods and services for the entire community. The party held a positive meeting  with the outgoing Finance Minister on that subject; and its members are working  on a paper for DFP officials, which, I hope, will be with them before the  summer recess. However, it is a matter of continued regret that addressing the  costs of division is not a core theme of the Budget and is not a feature of its  approach to efficiency savings. Investment in a shared future is required, and  that will lead to significant savings for society overall.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On the topic of efficiency savings in general, I make one  important point. The Alliance Party fully supports the concept of efficiency  savings. We believe that the 3% targets are achievable and that more can be  achieved. In that respect, we support the role of PEDU. Greater targets are  routinely sought and achieved each year in the private sector. However, for my  party, efficiency savings must be about increasing productivity and finding new  and creative ways of doing things to free up resources from outmoded purposes  or activities for reinvestment in new policies and practices. However, in  Northern Ireland, efficiency savings too readily become cuts. Rather than doing  things differently, Departments and public bodies carry on as before, but try  to do the same with less.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to explore the inefficiencies in the way that we  spend our money and what we miss out on as a consequence. With regard to the  environment, which Mr O&rsquo;Loan and Mr Sammy Wilson discussed, we have recently  been told that one reason we cannot have an independent environmental  protection agency is the cost: the agency would cost some &pound;2&middot;6 million to set  up and some &pound;600,000 per annum to operate. Those are relatively small sums;  however, the questions on which we must focus are the costs and consequences &mdash;  financially, economically and environmentally &mdash; of not having an independent  environmental protection agency. Obviously, there will still be problems, such  as infraction proceedings, even if we have an environmental protection agency.  However, the issue is one of scale; it is wrong to see it as a black-or-white  choice. We need an environmental protection agency to have more efficient and cost-effective  Government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I give way to the incoming Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Does the Member accept that, in the case of the independent Scottish  Environmental Protection Agency it was concluded that, the process of  decision-making was costly and became more cumbersome, and the Environmental  Protection Agency was totally out of touch with local communities? If the Member  looks for a different way of doing things, surely he will not consider one that  makes things worse?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the Member for his points. We all wish to learn lessons from how other  societies have introduced and operated environmental protection agencies.  However, that does not detract from my central point. We need an environmental  protection agency to challenge more efficiently how we conduct environ&shy;mental  business. If we do not have one, we will pay the economic and environmental  cost.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of transport, we place a heavy emphasis on roads  and private cars at the expense of public transport. In his statement this  morning, the Minister for Regional Development did not depart from that script.  We have a major congestion problem, particularly in greater Belfast. Other  societies are able to maintain a much more sustainable balance between public  and private transport; there is no reason why we cannot follow suit.  Incredibly, the current 10-year investment strategy puts 80% of new investment  into roads &mdash; that is well out of line with the practices of most of our  competitors. I fail to see how that will help us to rebalance our economy,  never mind make us more environmentally sustainable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have natural strengths in the creative arts. However, it  is staggering that we spend less per capita on culture than the UK average and well below our neighbours in Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Surely proper investment in the arts should be viewed as an  essential element of growing and transforming our economy?</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are also huge inefficiencies in the education system.  Despite the large budget that is allocated to the Department of Education,  there are major problems, for example, with the funding of the Youth Service  and resource allocation to primary schools. To put it simply: there is a high  level of education expenditure per capita but a low level of expenditure per  pupil. There are major inefficiencies in the schools estate that are leading to  distortions in expenditure. Too much money is spent on school buildings at the  expense of investment in pupils and staff.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party is concerned at the continued absence of  a sustainable schools policy. It believes that a system is needed that values a  range of options for shared schools. More specifically, the party is concerned  at how integrated schools are perceived. Integrated schools, whether newbuild  or transformed, are the most sustainable form of education, socially,  educationally and economically. However, at present, rather than being viewed  as part of the solution, they are seen as being part of the problem and are  regarded as a threat to the existing schools system. However, it is the schools  system that is inefficient, so we are missing an easy solution.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party has made the point that, in the Budget, Northern Ireland  is flatlining in comparison with the budgets allocated to health elsewhere in  these islands. The health budget is already the highest per capita in the UK, which,  sadly, reflects our relative need.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The highest level of increase will go to health, as well as  the highest level of new resources. However, none of that hides the reality  that we are simply not keeping up and that, by 2011, our health budget will be  &pound;200 million short of what we need to keep pace with our neighbours. The  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has settled for far too  little in his little political campaign.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, attempts to plug the gap in our Health Service  with monitoring rounds are flawed, for two reasons. First, monitoring round  resources have no impact on baselines. Secondly, the automatic first referral  to the Health Service distorts the monitoring process and the necessary  redistribution of resources across the entire system. Efficiency savings in the  Health Service are important. However, such savings are viewed by the general population  as cuts. Indeed, that reality is confronting elected representatives across Northern Ireland  &mdash; including DUP MLAs &mdash; as expressed recently in local newspapers.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Given the rising costs of drugs, technology and our ageing  population, we need to keep up with the pace of investment elsewhere in the  world. Efficiency savings in health are necessary and will assist in keeping up  with that pace. However, those efficiency savings must be complemented with new  resources and investment in areas such as mental health and free personal care  for elderly people.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: I wish to highlight some  issues about the Department of Education&rsquo;s sizeable budget of over &pound;2 billion.  The Committee has concerns that, although over &pound;2 billion is available for  education in Northern    Ireland, only 62% of that ever reaches  schools. That figure is substantially lower than in other parts of the UK; in England, for example, 80% of the  money available for education is delegated to schools. Many problems in our  education system could be addressed if there were greater delegation.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Departmental officials have told the Committee that the  operation of several education initiatives means that moneys are withheld from  schools. Some &pound;190 million is ring-fenced for those initiatives, which  represents 19% of the money that is allocated to our schools.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">All the school principals who appeared before the Committee  said that they would prefer that the money currently being held centrally for  initiatives were delegated to them. They could then spend the money as they see  fit in their own schools. Those principals also said that it was time-consuming  to research those initiatives, complete the highly bureaucratic application  forms, and to monitor, check and evaluate.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Several school principals said that some initiatives  require them to buy computers &mdash; which they do not need, but they do not want to  pass up the opportunity &mdash; or to engage in activities that they do not consider  to be of priority, but which qualify them for the initiative. The Department  must address that situation. The Committee has asked the Department to  highlight the initiatives and to establish how many of them could be withdrawn  without any adverse effect on the quality of what goes on in the schools, thus  releasing money to the school budgets.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for North Down Dr Farry said that one of the  ways of making the budget work better was to do things differently. In  education, for instance, he said that we spend too much money on buildings &mdash;  and therein lies a contradiction. We do spend too much money on buildings;  there are a lot of half-empty buildings that require money. However, Dr Farry&rsquo;s  simple solution is to build more. That is the meat on the bones of the Alliance  Party&rsquo;s verbiage. Dr Farry said that we should increase productivity, and that  means looking at outmoded methods and doing things differently.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The only two examples that he provided of how things could  be done differently were to build integrated schools &mdash; when there is  overcapacity in the existing schools system &mdash; and to set up a costly  independent environmental protection agency. It is all very well to utter fine  words about increased productivity, doing things differently and testing the  boundaries of how money is being spent &mdash;</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: I will in a minute or two.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">However, when one examines how things could be done  differently, one finds that the different way will lead to less efficiency,  more waste and greater spending.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am grateful to the Member for giving way. The advocacy of integrated schools is  based on the fact that enrolments are falling and the sad reality that many  schools across Northern    Ireland are unsustainable and will, in fact,  have to be closed. Does the Member agree that in a typical village in Northern  Ireland in which a controlled primary school and a Catholic maintained primary  school, for instance, are under threat of closure due to falling enrolments, it  makes sense to build a single shared school for the community, rather than to  bus two sets of children to neighbouring towns?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: I am sure that everyone in the Chamber will  agree that that is an admirable solution, but that is not integrated education  &agrave; la the Alliance Party. In the House &mdash; and at local level &mdash; Alliance Party  represent&shy;atives have said that, not only should there be a Catholic school and  a controlled school, but a third school should be built. That is what most of  the Alliance Party advocacy of integrated education that I have heard consists  of, and it leads to a greater waste of money. It is not the way forward, and it  will not lead to greater productivity.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  heard Dr Farry heckling from the side when Sammy Wilson was commenting on the  building of more schools in the integrated sector. Closing schools is the  Alliance Party&rsquo;s position. Does the Member look forward, as I do, to the Member  for North Down&rsquo;s public statement containing the names of the schools in North  Down that he would close?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Does he believe that the Member will not be able to put his money where his  mouth is on this issue?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: He will not, probably. The comment that he  made from his sedentary position is not true, because, according to officials  from the Department of Education and the South Eastern Education and Library  Board, Bangor  alone has 1,500 more school places than are needed. That is the context that we  are looking at. I could give many other examples of representations that have  been made to the Committee. In one case, there was a surplus of 2,000 places,  but an Alliance Party Member suggested that another school be built.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">That is not the way forward and does not represent a better  use of education money. However, alternatives must be examined.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The second issue that the Committee highlights is the  current in-year monitoring. It is a great pity that the Department could not  bring along its proposed bids to the Department of Finance for Committee  scrutiny. In the event that other Committees are having the same experience, a  warning should go out from this debate about the duty which rests with  Departments. The recommendation was that, as part of in-year monitoring,  Departments should come along with bids to see whether the Committee would  support them. That is not happening, even though it might be helpful to  Ministers to have Committee backing for some bids.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As far as the Department of Education is concerned, one of  the things highlighted by the Committee is the need for the bid for extended  schools to be met through in-year monitoring. I know that, as the Member for  East Antrim Mr Beggs pointed out, that is not the best way of doing it, but if  an extension of another year can be obtained through that mechanism, it will be  better than the current situation, in which extended schools are being cut.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member accept that it is not only extended schools that are provided in  primary schools? There are other after-school clubs, and breakfast clubs, which  are also provided by the voluntary sector.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: I accept that. I am making the point that,  while it is not the ideal way of ensuring that the extended schools programme  is financed for another year, it is better than the present situation, in which  many face being cut totally and some get only a percentage of their  expenditure. It was another area of concern for the Committee.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The last area about which the Committee expressed concern  was the huge discrepancy in spending between primary and secondary schools. I  hope that many Members will take part in a debate on a motion that will be  brought to this House on the importance of getting money skewed towards primary  schools in order that the disadvantage that is experienced by many youngsters  in their first years in school is addressed. Later problems can be avoided  through emphasis on remedial action in early years. That is something that I  would like to see, and it can be done within the existing budget by looking for  efficiencies &mdash; different ways of spending available money. That is how to  address the huge spending gap, especially for primary schools.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Both these motions will enable  Departments to draw down the necessary resources from the Consolidated Fund to  deliver services. That is an important part of the Budget process, as the Main  Estimates and Excess Vote resolutions are the next stages in ensuring that  money goes to the various spending authorities. The process also sets limits on  receipts that will be brought in, and provides authority to use those against  various services.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Great concern has been expressed inside and outside this  Chamber recently about the level of underspend in the budgets of Departments,  which the Minister mentioned in her statement. Any form of accounting involves  a margin of error, but the financial management of Departments is an area in  which performance could be improved.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In essence, we are guardians of public money. Therefore, in  their Committee and Assembly roles, all Members have a responsibility to hold  Departments to account if local people are not receiving services to which they  are entitled. Departments need to work closely with Committees to ensure that they  meet those targets and to provide information on time rather than at the last  minute, which has sometimes been the case.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members have commented on the recent upsurge in the  general cost of living, including the price of fuel and food, which has created  public concern. Sometimes, the cost of living is talked about in a way which  makes it seem very abstract.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">For example, a meal for a family of five now costs almost  &pound;3 extra, meaning that such families are spending an extra &pound;3 on every meal.  Therefore, the issue is of real concern for people. The Executive and  Departments need to be innovative in introducing measures to deal with that  issue, such as working alongside energy companies to supply social tariffs and  finding better ways to spend their budgets.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We are facing a period where essential front-line services  that are delivered by community and voluntary organisations are being put at  risk due to a lack of funding. Again, sometimes, our understanding of those  services can be abstract, but they are delivered to people in local  communities. When organisations that are closing due to a lack of funding see  that such a large amount of money has gone unspent in departmental budgets over  the past year, they have every right to be concerned. That is because some of  that money was allocated to those services but was not distributed to the  organisations that would have delivered them.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive &mdash; along with Departments &mdash; have a  responsibility to ensure the delivery of their priorities as set out in the  Programme for Government. The procurement guidelines that were launched  recently offer an opportunity to deliver the social outcomes that are outlined  in the investment strategy, thus ensuring delivery of equality of opportunity  and tackling poverty and disadvantage. That is what we need to be doing.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  The Member is quite right when she says that those priorities should be  foremost in all our minds. However, does she not agree that decisions about  them should be made in this House, rather than by people running to Downing Street?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I thank the Member for her intervention; however, I believe that we all have a  responsibility to ensure that people are not going cold or hungry. I support  both motions and believe that they can be seen as a first step towards  achieving our objectives. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for the hard and diligent work that he has done in  preparing the Budget and the motion, which I support. I am fully aware that  some Members have constantly moaned and groaned about the Budget and the  departmental allocations. It is my hope that, today, those Members will come  back to reality and support the motion to ensure that the Programme for  Government that has been agreed by the Executive and the Assembly can be  implemented.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget has provided the Executive with an opportunity  to improve the lives of people in Northern Ireland by allocating  resources to high-priority areas, where the funds will yield the greatest  benefit. Individual Ministers will determine how the resources from the Budget  are distributed in the context of the competing needs and priorities in their  Departments. I have no doubt that those are vastly distinct from the priorities  and the local understanding that direct rule Ministers had.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">With the required approvals granted, it would be an act of  complete stupidity to reject the motion. Although there is no doubt that that  would appeal to some, it would ensure that all Departments were unable to carry  through the programmes that they have devised according to their budget  allocations. Critics of the Budget would have a few questions to answer as to  how such an approach would best serve the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to see the targets on the treatment of cancer met,  the supply of new social housing achieved, and the development of our road and  public transport continued. However, all that will be possible only if the  Departments have the necessary funding. That is why it is essential that the  motion is successful. Failure to agree the motion &mdash; especially after the recent  important investment conference &mdash; would be a suicidal course of action for the  Assembly, as it would damage prospective investors&rsquo; confidence in Northern Ireland.  The party opposite has done enough damage to that confidence in the past few  days. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that the motion is agreed.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. As Question Time commences at 2.30 pm, I suggest that the  House takes its ease until that time. This debate will continue after Question  Time, when the first Member called to speak will be Mr Dominic Bradley.</p>

	        <p class="H3SectionHeading">Office Of The First Minister And Deputy First  Minister</p>
	        <p class="H4StageHeading">Executive Committee: Cross-community Votes</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  Spratt </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister for  the number of times that a cross community vote has been triggered at meetings  of the Executive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3872/08>(AQO 3872/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: Three cross-community votes have been triggered  at meetings of the Executive. All occurred at the meeting of the Executive on  15 May 2008, and related to the same subject.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  welcome Mr Robinson to his first Question Time as First Minister.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  congratulate him on his election as First Minister of Northern Ireland.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Will the First Minister confirm whether the Executive&rsquo;s  decision to proceed with a separate water charge from next April was taken  unanimously?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: First, I thank my colleague for his kind remarks and good wishes.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have dealt with around 228 issues since  devolution in May 2007. There has been division on only four of those issues,  of which only one has gone to a cross-community vote. None of the issues on  which there was division included water charging.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">That issue has come before the Executive on two occasions  in two different ways. On the first occasion, it was as part of the premise on  which Budget allocations were made. The Member will know that my Executive  colleagues unanimously supported the Budget; there was no Division in the House  either.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">On the second &mdash; more recent &mdash; occasion, the Minister for  Regional Development brought forward a paper on how those matters should be  handled. Again, the Executive agreed to that without division.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I also welcome the new First Minister to his position. Does the First Minister  have any plans to convene an early meeting of the leaders of the political  parties who are represented on the Executive?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I thank the Member for Newry and Armagh  for his good wishes.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Today, I, as a party leader, wrote to the other party  leaders &mdash; not only those who sit on the Executive, but those who sit in the  House outside the Executive &mdash; indicating that I would welcome the opportunity  to speak to them about matters relating to the Assembly and beyond. I hope to  take account of what they have to say.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Neither the deputy First Minister nor I would avoid meeting  other party leaders; we would certainly consider it. We welcome an exchange  with all Members of the House. If all Members enter into discussions in a  constructive manner, it may be very useful.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  also welcome the new First Minister to the House. I wish him well for the  future.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">My question relates to the issue of collectivity in the Executive.  Will the First Minister give us his assurances &mdash; amid the public controversy  that is going on outside the House &mdash; that the Executive and OFMDFM are fully  committed to their obligations to promote equality and good relations between  the persons and groups listed under section 75 of Northern Ireland Act 1998,  including the gay and lesbian community?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Executive have a good record on collectivity.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The figures that I outlined earlier would have done credit  to any one-party Executive. The Executive have dealt with more than 228 issues;  they had to vote on only four occasions in a straight vote, and once in a  cross-community vote. Indeed, two of the issues in the straight voting were on  the same matter, although voting took place on two separate occasions.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Very few issues have caused division in the Executive. They  acted collectively on the key issues that have been brought to the Assembly;  particularly those arising from the Programme for Government, which sets up the  Assembly manifesto for the next three years. The Executive took the collective  decision to move forward in that direction.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  is legally obliged to ensure that no one is discriminated against in our society.  Even if there were no legal obligation, I would be at the forefront in  defending anyone who was being discriminated against. I know that my colleague  the Member for Strangford would be alongside me in doing that. As far as the  community is concerned, it is absolutely essential that there is equality for  people. Equality of opportunity should be at the forefront in all our minds  regarding all of these issues. My colleague from East   Belfast has given me the opportunity to say that I totally deplore  any attacks that take place on individuals, whether it is because of their  religion, their politics or their way of life.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Planning Appeals Commission</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr Weir </strong>asked  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister for its assessment  of the average time taken for a decision by the Planning Appeals Commission.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3865/08>(AQO 3865/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Bresland </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  to detail the budget of the Planning Appeals Commission for the last three  years; and its budget for the next three years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3848/08>(AQO  3848/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will answer questions 2 and 3  together.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In the past financial year, the average length of time  taken to determine an appeal was 82 weeks. The delay in making decisions is due  to the backlog of planning appeal cases that has amassed over recent years.  That backlog is of considerable concern to the deputy First Minister and me.  Consequently, significant additional financial resources have been committed to  enable the chief commissioner to address the backlog of planning appeals.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The budget of the Planning Appeals Commission remained  constant, at &pound;1&middot;858 million per annum, for the last three years, 2005 to 2008.  During those years, the commission was only able to retain receipts of up to  &pound;56,000; &pound;150,000; and &pound;241,000 respectively. For the next three years, the  budget figures are &pound;2&middot;368 million in the current financial year; &pound;2&middot;378 million  for 2009-2010; and &pound;2&middot;396 million for 2010-11.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, in each of those years, the commission will be  able to retain receipts of &pound;376,000 per annum. In short, the commission has  been provided with the additional spending power of over &pound;700,000 each year,  which will allow it to recruit additional commissioners. Eight commissioners have  been appointed in recent months, and a competition for a further 10 panel  commissioners is underway. That will be followed by a further competition for  commissioners in the autumn. The deputy First Minister and I will continue to  keep the situation under close review.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  add my congratulations to the First Minister on his first Question Time.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">When the First Minister, in his previous capacity as  Finance Minister, established the performance and efficiency delivery unit  (PEDU), he made the Planning Service one of its initial areas of focus. In  light of the delays in the Planning Appeals Commission that he outlined today,  does he believe that that aspect of the planning system should have an equal  level of focus?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: At the outset, it should be made clear that the Planning Appeals  Commission is an independent body. Moreover, it is an independent body that  seems to have a very high degree of respect. It is worth pointing out that when  issues such as the review of public administration (RPA) were considered,  virtually all of the parties fought hard to ensure that the Planning Appeals  Commission would be retained as a separate and independent body.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There are not many bodies that are still capable of gaining  the support of public representatives and the wider community despite having a  growing list of backlog cases. People are supportive of the role that the  Planning Appeals Commission performs.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There is a relationship between the Planning Service, and  the cases that it deals with, and the Planning Appeals Commission. Very often,  I found that people become fed up with the delay in the Planning Service and  take their cases out of the normal planning routine after the appropriate  number of months pass. They then put them to the Planning Appeals Commission  because they think that that might be a faster route and fear that their cases  might end up with the Planning Appeals Commission anyway. That adds to the  burden.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Planning Appeals Commission is an independent body, so  it would be unhelpful and unwelcome were PEDU to burst through its doors and  attempt to deal with the commission&rsquo;s business. The Planning Appeals Commission  is required to be fit for purpose. The deputy First Minister and I will do  everything that we can to assist the commission to ensure that it reduces its  backlog and is able to deal with matters more expeditiously.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  What action have the Executive taken to deal with the problems that the  Planning Appeals Commission faces?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I indicated that the former First Minister and the deputy First  Minister recognised &mdash; presumably after discussions with the Planning Appeals  Commission &mdash; that it needed further resources. The nice guy who used to be the  Finance Minister readily acceded to that request, and, as a result, more funds  have been allocated to the commission. However, I warn Members that a lead-in  time is involved. Not only is recruitment needed &mdash; the Planning Appeals  Commission has a rigorous appointment requirement, in order to ensure that its  commissioners have the highest level of competence &mdash; but training then lasts  for roughly one year. We will have to be patient. Even though the resources are  there, and even though the Planning Appeals Commission has moved quickly to  compose its recruitment panels, that requirement will remain for a long time,  until trained commissioners are in post. There will be some delay, but the  deputy First Minister and I will continue to review the matter.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I, too, welcome the First Minister to his first Question Time and wish him well  for the future.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I listened intently to how he described the improve&shy;ments  to the Planning Appeals Commission and look forward to seeing those work in  practice. When considering the Planning Appeals Commission, will the First  Minister ensure that, when they appear before the commission, members of the  public are afforded the same rights that developers appear to have? A developer  can introduce a full team of planning experts, tree experts, bat experts &mdash; you  name it &mdash; plus legal representation. A member of the public feels at a severe  disadvantage when appearing before the commission.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I take the Member&rsquo;s point, although I emphasise that the Planning  Appeals Commission is an independent body, so it must satisfy itself on the  procedures that it adopts. Members of the public have the same opportunity as  others to have legal representation or to bring in experts. However, the  reality is somewhat different &mdash; members of the public will not have the same  resources that are available to developers. Therefore, it is important that the  Planning Appeals Commission attach appropriate weight to remarks made by  members of the public who have concerns about planning applications. It must also  take into consideration the fact that they do not have the same expertise  behind them as developers have.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I, too, welcome the First Minister to  his first Question Time in that capacity.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">What action can the First Minister take in order to  prioritise appeals for accommodation for severely disabled people? I was  involved in an appeal recently that took up to a year and a half. That places a  great deal of stress on young families with a severely disabled person in the  household.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I can take no action at all. The independence of the Planning  Appeals Commission is such that it would be inappropriate for the deputy First  Minister and me to intervene in its caseload. However, I will draw the Member&rsquo;s  views to the commission&rsquo;s attention. It may feel that fast-tracking is required  in certain cases.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">My clear message is that the Planning Appeals Commission is  keen to deal expeditiously with all its cases. However, since 2003-04, the  number of cases has roughly trebled. That level of increase is an indication  that major planning applications will be submitted, particularly given the  current circumstances in which we are coming out of a period of significant  economic growth. Planning law requires public inquiries on the area plans, and  that has also added significantly to the commission&rsquo;s workload.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">That combination of factors caused a considerable backlog  of cases. In normal circumstances, the prioritisation of one type of  application should not be an issue, but, until the backlog is cleared, there  may be a case for the Planning Appeals Commission to consider whether any  particularly sensitive cases should be prioritised and heard out of their  normal order.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Capital Realisation Taskforce Report</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Hilditch </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  if the Executive have considered the capital realisation taskforce report.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3885/08>(AQO 3885/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Executive considered the report at their meeting on 21 January  2008. Work is under way to progress the report&rsquo;s key recommendations, which are  vital to ensuring the delivery of the entire investment strategy for Northern Ireland  and achieving value for money from the assets base.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  In the light of the Prime Minister&rsquo;s recent offer of asset sales and given the  need for capital expenditure in Northern    Ireland, will the First Minister agree that  early progress on capital realisation is essential?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: In the Budget and the investment strategy for Northern Ireland,  as supported by the Assembly, assumptions were made about asset disposal and  other block grant funding. Therefore, it is necessary to proceed with careful  haste on any asset sales. I enter that slight caveat because the Executive&rsquo;s  task is to maximise the return from any asset disposal, and they must take  account of the standing of the property market at any given time.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I also wish the First Minister well in  his new role, and I wish the deputy Minister well in his continued role.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Will the First Minister identify the targets for the  disposal of surplus assets in 2008-2011? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The capital realisation task force identified that the Executive  could dispose of &pound;300 million of additional assets. The Budget and investment  strategy took into account &pound;200 million of that, and care was taken not to  allocate money beyond the total amount possible. In addition to that, the  original figures had already taken into account &pound;1&middot;4 billion of asset disposal  and capital receipts for the three-year period to 2010-11. That is a  significant sum, and it requires all Departments to examine their timetables  carefully to ensure that the capital is realised during the period of the CSR.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  also extend my good wishes to the First Minister.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">According to information that was given to the DARD  Committee, a downward adjustment has reduced the valuation of the DARD-owned  property at Crossnacreevy from &pound;200 million to a mere &pound;3 million to &pound;6 million.  Is the Minister not extremely concerned by that? How can the Assembly be  confident that the Budget, on which the Programme for Government depends, will  be delivered?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: As someone whose background is in estate agency, I can tell the  Member that any land or property is worth what a willing purchaser will pay for  it on the open market. At present, there are not too many willing purchasers,  and that has an impact on the price of any asset. However, the other factor is  whether planning permission exists for any type of development on the site at  Crossnacreevy, because the land is worth much less without it.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">One of the issues that the Department of Agriculture and  Rural Development and the Department of Finance and Personnel will have to  consider is whether to apply for planning permission, and sell with that  permission, or whether to simply sell the site with a hoped-for value attached  to it. The lower price clearly refers to the amount without planning permission  for development.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Economic Investment Conference: &nbsp;Outcomes</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  Gardiner </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  to comment on the outcomes of the economic investment conference; and to detail  its plans for other, similar events.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3864/08>(AQO  3864/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The recent US/Northern Ireland investment conference was an  enormous success. As well as the very significant dignitaries in attendance, 90  companies, represented by over 140 business leaders, were represented. At the  conference, NYSE EuroNext and Cybersource announced new inward investments,  which have the potential to create over 120 new high-quality jobs. Those  announcements, along with major investments of some &pound;77 million announced by  Bombardier and Independent News and Media, aimed at safeguarding over 1,100  jobs, added to the success.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We are extremely encouraged by the positive reflections in  the media on the immediate impact of the conference. Initial feedback from  delegates is also very encouraging. The Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister will be working hard over the coming months to capitalise on the  success of the event. The full outcome of the conference will take some time to  come to fruition. Invest Northern    Ireland has put in place a comprehensive  follow-up campaign. Since the conference has proven to be such a success, we  consider it a model for potential future events in London  and Dublin, to  follow up with attendees and companies in those cities.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I join with my colleagues in wishing the First Minister every good health in  the post of heavy responsibility to which he has been appointed.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The so-called BRIC economies &mdash; Brazil,  Russia, India and China &mdash; are all expanding  economies. Would it be possible to organise an Asian investment conference,  targeting China, Japan and India, along the lines of the  US/Northern Ireland investment conference?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I appreciate the Member&rsquo;s comments. My colleague, the Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment, has already visited India, and  spoke to me of the massive potential that he saw there. Having visited the Middle East with the Westminster Select Committee on  Northern Ireland Affairs some years ago, I see the potential of that area of  the world.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Invest NI will examine where it is appropriate to establish  offices. I have no doubt that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment will be quite happy to consider missions to those countries. I am  quite sure that the deputy First Minister and I will be very happy to offer  support in that area.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I, too, warmly welcome the First Minister to his first Question Time in his new  role.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister will be well aware of the importance of  delivering the type of jobs that those who attended the conference can provide  in helping the Executive to achieve its targets on increasing productivity and  closing the gross value added gap. Will he comment on what steps he has taken  to encourage employment in Northern    Ireland from Bombardier&rsquo;s CSeries project?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Member is right that the Programme for Government prioritised  economic growth, which requires us to aim to secure high-value-added jobs. That  is clearly one of the factors that will have an effect on improving our gross  value added (GVA). Securing better exports improves our GVA, and Bombardier is  one of the corporations that clearly has a massive export potential for Northern Ireland.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The deputy First Minister and I have spoken with the Prime  Minister about the Bombardier CSeries. I have had a number of conversations  with the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State on that issue. I know that  both DFP and DETI have been in touch with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) in London, and Invest Northern Ireland has been holding regular  meetings. I understand that there is a very important meeting later this week  on that issue.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, there are commercial issues to consider, which  perhaps limit what I can say on the matter; but the CSeries would be very  important for the development of Bombardier in Belfast, for potential jobs and,  indeed, for the long tenure that those jobs would have.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Like other Members, I wish the First Minister well for the future in his new  role.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As he realises, the organisation of the investment  conference depended largely on interdepartmental co-operation. Economic growth  is not the responsibility of just one Department. Will he assure me that he  will ensure that that interdepartmental co-operation will continue to try to  attract new investment into Northern    Ireland?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The deputy First Minister and I are committed to ensuring that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  investment potential is maximised. I indicated that the investment conference,  which invited people from North America to Northern Ireland, will be a good model  for further conferences. The deputy First Minister and I are examining the  possibility of conferences in London and Dublin to follow up some  of the contacts that were made during the investment conference.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is correct: all Departments played a part. DEL was deeply involved  in the event. DCAL, DETI and my former Department were also involved, as was  OFMDFM, which had a central role. I am sure that DARD was also involved,  because I recall that issues arose with regard to food. Had I not mentioned  that, the Minister would have pointed it out quickly when she got an  opportunity. Therefore, all of the Departments threw their weight behind the  project in a joined-up way. I am convinced that they will do the same in any  future event.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Will the First Minister outline targets set by the Executive to ensure that any  future investment as a result of the conference will tackle deprivation and  social and economic disadvantage?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Having been in the job for only a matter of a few days, one  conversation that I have had with the deputy First Minister identified  deprivation and need as an area that we have both prioritised and in which we  share a desire that focus and energy should be applied. Too often, the  Programme for Government might be identified as having a trickle-down effect;  that when the economy is boosted, ultimately, people will get jobs and that  will assist them. The deputy First Minister and I both believe that deprivation  must be tackled immediately at ground-floor level. That will certainly be part  of our aim. Of course, the location of those jobs will have an impact. There is  no better way out of deprivation than to get people into employment.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland currently has a higher level of  employment than has ever been the case before. It has one of the lowest levels  of unemployment of any part of the British Isles.  Therefore, opportunities exist. If additional higher-value-added jobs can be  brought into Northern Ireland,  I believe that the tide will rise for everyone.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Visit of the President of the United States</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Lord  Browne </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  what is its assessment of the forthcoming visit of the President of the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3850/08>(AQO 3850/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The decision by the President of the United   States to visit Belfast  during his forthcoming tour of European capital cities is a clear demonstration  of his personal commitment to Northern    Ireland. We look forward to welcoming him  here on Monday 16 June. We were pleased to learn that the first lady will  accompany him. We hope that the visit will attract a significant level of  positive media coverage in the United States  and around the world, and that it will help to promote Northern Ireland  as a place in which to invest and as a tourist destination. The timing of the  visit, soon after the investment conference, is particularly useful for Invest  NI, which will be able to use the attendant publicity to maintain a positive  image of Northern Ireland  with corporate America.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  I also want to congratulate the First Minister on his appointment and wish him  well in his office. I also welcome his statement on the visit of President Bush  to Northern Ireland,  particularly to Parliament Buildings at Stormont. It is an historic occasion. I  am sure that the Assembly wants to express again its sympathy with the American  people on the great loss of life that they suffered on 9/11 and its solidarity  with President Bush in his continuing efforts to protect his people from future  acts of terror.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Will the First Minister use the opportunity of the  President&rsquo;s visit to reinforce the message that Northern Ireland is a good place in  which to invest?</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The community recognises the great sacrifice that has been made  by many Americans, and the day in history to which the Member referred will  long be regarded as being one of its darkest moments. Perhaps this is an  opportunity for me to pass on condolences from the people of Northern Ireland to the families of the three  soldiers who were killed in Helmand province.  We all extend our sympathy to those families.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to note that the President personally  wished to make the visit to demonstrate his support for the devolved  Administration. That identifies the fact that Northern Ireland is open for  business.</p>

	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  McElduff </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to detail  her Department&rsquo;s remit for helping to regenerate rural villages and towns.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3910/08>(AQO 3910/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: My Department&rsquo;s remit on  rural settlements that have a population of fewer than 4,500 is met mainly  through the village renewal measure of the new rural development programme for  2007-2013. Along with other measures in priority 3 of the programme, the  village renewal measure will be implemented by local action groups working in  partnership with council clusters.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The types of activities that are to be funded will depend  on the priorities in the area strategy of the partnership and the types of  applications that are received from the local community. I am confident that  that measure will provide an excellent opportunity for the enhancement of rural  settlements.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be interested in the financial allocations to  the seven council clusters of the first &pound;50 million of funding for axis-3  measures, which have now been correctly calculated, based on population and deprivation.  The allocations are: &pound;6,211,991 for the north-east; &pound;11,259,048 for the  north-west; &pound;12,721,715 for mid Ulster;  &pound;9,570,714 for the Craigavon cluster; &pound;6,592,695 for Down; &pound;1,793,712 for the  Antrim cluster; and &pound;1,850,124 for the Lisburn cluster.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the Minister confirm that the  amount of funding that is to be allocated to the north-west is an increased  figure on an earlier announcement? I am particularly interested in whether the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) definition of &ldquo;urban&rdquo;  and &ldquo;rural&rdquo; is the same as that understood by the Department for Social  Development.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The initial figures were based on a  miscalculation, and the Department has taken steps to address that.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">For the purposes of the rural development programme,  &ldquo;rural&rdquo; is defined as all areas that fall outside of the statutory development  limit of towns with a population in excess of 4,500 inhabitants. However, the  programme will retain the flexibility to support projects that are located in  more urban settings, where the projects will principally benefit rural towns  and where a strong case can be made for them.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Some groups have found that they have fallen between two  stools in relation to funding, and the Minister for Social Development and I  have asked officials to schedule an early meeting so that we can discuss and  address that important issue.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her response. I am sure that the Minister is aware of  the good work that has been carried out in many Protestant areas by rural  groups. Can she provide an assurance that she intends to maintain, or indeed to  enhance, funding to rural groups in Protestant areas?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: As the Member knows, a pilot scheme has  been running on that. As I said, the priorities that local action groups place  in their clusters will decide how funding is allocated. That is a bottom-up  approach, and local communities must take ownership to have flexibility in  their decision-making process. The pilot schemes that I have mentioned are  ongoing.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.

	        <p class="B3BodyText">Given the Department of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s rejection  of the Forkhill and District Development Association&rsquo;s plans for the vacated  army site, and considering the fact that there is a greater likelihood that  such sites will be gifted to the Executive, what strategy does the Minister  have to ensure that that proposal is kept alive?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: DARD&rsquo;s involvement in the development of  that project fits with the overall theme of the &lsquo;Rural Strategy 2007-2013&rsquo;, which  is to diversify the rural economy, protect the rural environment and sustain  rural communities.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the project meets one of the key aims of the  Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;Strategic Plan 2006-2011&rsquo;:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to strengthen the social and economic infrastructure  of rural areas&rdquo;.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Furthermore, it meets with the aims of the  Programme for Government, which was agreed by the Executive in January 2008,  and in which DARD was charged to:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Help rural communities improve the physical, economic  and social infrastructure of their areas.&rdquo;</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, given that the project is consistent with the Department&rsquo;s  plans, I would like to see it come to fruition.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Botulism in Armagh</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr Irwin </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development what her assessment  is of the recent cases of botulism in cattle in the Armagh area; and what plans  she has to increase awareness of the disease in terms of its causes and  effects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3878/08>(AQO 3878/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Botulism is not a notifiable disease;  however, during April and May, farmers from County Armagh  reported four suspected cases of botulism to private veterinary practitioners.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In 2006, there were 73 suspected cases, and, in 2007, 77  suspected cases were reported. That demonstrates a decline from the peak number  of suspected cases &mdash; 138 &mdash; that were reported in 2003. To date this year, 27  cases have been reported, which suggests that, pro rata, there is no evidence  of a rise in the number of suspected cases. Putting that in context, in 2003,  the number of suspected cases in the North peaked at 138; in 2006, that number  fell to 73; and that level was maintained in 2007.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Advisory leaflets on botulism are available from DARD for  all farmers. In addition, posters are on display at local DARD veterinary  offices, agricultural offices, auction marts and Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union offices,  and they alert farmers to the dangers of botulism and advise them about  appropriate control measures. Furthermore, advice is available from the DARD  website. Consequently, awareness among farmers of the disease, the risk factors  involved and the benefit of vaccination as a control tool should now be  widespread.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">An effective vaccine against botulism in cattle can be  obtained through private veterinary practitioners, and that vaccine has been  successful in helping to control botulism in cattle here.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>:  The farmers in Armagh who lost valuable  animals and identified the possible source of the problem to veterinary  officials are unhappy &mdash; to say the least &mdash; that the Department took no action  to deal with the problem. Does the Minister&rsquo;s Department have any powers to  take action against the people who were responsible for handling chicken manure  in a manner that was unsafe for livestock?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: As I said, botulism is not a notifiable  disease. However, private veterinary surgeons may submit carcasses to the  Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) for investigation. DARD cannot  comment on cases in which the evidence is anecdotal. However, if anyone has  firm evidence of fraud, we would be very interested to hear about it and to act  accordingly.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Considering the risk to human health from some forms of botulism, will the  Minister assure the House that no risk to human health currently exists?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Risk assessments that were conducted on behalf  of the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food did not  identify a significant risk to the public from food that is associated to botulism  in cattle. That is mainly because, in the vast majority of cases, the toxins  that were isolated from cattle do not affect people. Nevertheless, the advice  to affected farms is that milk and meat from animals that show signs of the  disease should be withheld from sale for human consumption.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Does the Minister support the use of incinerators to destroy chicken waste?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: That question is not in any way  connected to the main question, so I choose not to answer it.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Brucellosis: Testing Results</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr Burns </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development what action she is  taking to improve the time taken between the testing for brucellosis and  issuing test results.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3824/08>(AQO 3824/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I am aware from feedback from the recent  farmers&rsquo; meetings held as part of the brucellosis initiative and from talking  to farmers that they have experienced delays in receiving brucellosis test  results. The delays occurred because, as a result of improved surveillance, we  have increased the volume of brucellosis testing by 15% from the figure for the  same period last year. That increased volume has had an impact on turnaround  times.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">During the first quarter of 2008, the average time that it  took to make a result available after having taken a sample rose to 10&middot;7 days  from 8&middot;25 days for the same period in 2007. Moreover, there was additional  pressure on staff resources and availability as, over that period, AFBI was  also processing tests for bluetongue. AFBI has now redeployed staff, and I am  pleased to say that there is no longer a backlog of tests for brucellosis.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the time currently taken by her Department to  release results is unacceptable? Will she consider applying a 30-day retention  period from the day that the test results are issued?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: In the first quarter of 2007, the  average time from sampling to delivery at the laboratory was 4&middot;5 days. In the  same period in 2008, that figure increased slightly to five days. Again, that  was due to the increased volume of testing this year, combined with peak demand  by farmers for veterinary service staff to carry out sampling during the  housing period. That meant that those who took the samples had less time to  return to their offices to process the test results. Resource constraints also  adversely affect delivery times.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Veterinary Service is continuing to monitor performance  in those areas to minimise the impact on the programme and the delays  experienced by farmers. I assure the Member that I take this issue very  seriously and that I wish to give farmers the maximum amount of time following  receipt of their test results before they move or sell cattle. I am very aware  of that issue, which has been raised in the successful meetings that we held on  the brucellosis initiative earlier this year.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  Many farmers are concerned about the length of time that it takes DARD officials  to remove animals that have tested positive for brucellosis. What assurance can  the Minister give that her Department will speed up the removal of the infected  cattle?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I am very conscious of that matter. A  leaflet was issued last week to outline what a farmer should do if there is a  suspected case of brucellosis. We want those carcasses to be picked up as soon  as possible. In the interim, farmers could double-bag them in ordinary bin bags  &mdash; they should be secure until officials come to pick them up. I agree that  there is a risk associated with carcasses or foetuses being on farms, and I  want that situation to be improved.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. What is the current incidence of  brucellosis in the North?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The herd incidence where brucellosis is  confirmed by bacteriological culture has remained level since October 2006 at  0&middot;26%. More sensitive testing is identifying more potentially infected animals,  hence the rise in the overall annual herd incidence from 0&middot;6% in 2006 to the  current level of 1&middot;01%.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Biomass</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development how her  Department will use the development of energy generation from biomass energy to  create jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3875/08>(AQO 3875/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The development of biomass technology  has the potential to create jobs, but that technology is in its early stages.  We are encouraging its growth and promoting the opportunities for renewable  energy in the agrifood and forestry sectors and wider rural community through  technology transfer and demonstration prog&shy;rammes at the College of Agriculture,  Food and Rural Enterprise (CAFRE) and AFBI, and via measures in the rural  development programme. In particular, employment creation is central to measure  3.2 of that programme: &lsquo;Business creation and development&rsquo;.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">During a recent visit to a major timber processor in the  west, I saw at first hand a highly successful example of the innovative use of  wood fibre for the generation of electricity and heat, and the production of  wood fuel pellets for domestic and industrial use. I was particularly pleased  that my Department, though the Forest Service, was involved with a commercial  customer and other Government agencies in creating the circumstances that  allowed investment in that renewable-energy technology.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">That is underpinning the viability of the business and  associated jobs, which are particularly significant in that rural area, as well  as a higher-value market for timber from the Department&rsquo;s forests.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">My Department is also working with the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) through the bioenergy interdepartmental  working group in order to assess the potential market opportunities for energy  from biomass and to address cost-cutting issues such as job creation relevant  to the agricultural sector.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her positive response. A recent report from Action  Renewables for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, to which I  believe the Minister referred, highlighted the potential for job creation  arising from the use of renewable energy sources. Does the Minister agree that  greater co-operation is needed between her Department and DETI in order to  maximise the economic and environmental benefits of energy from biomass?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Good levels of co-operation already  exist, and I am not opposed to increasing that co-operation in order to benefit  the rural community.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Does the Minister accept, after the recent Assembly debate about the Rose  Energy plant that is proposed for Glenavy, and the failure of her Department to  come up with something suitable to help the farming industry, especially the  poultry industry, that if that proposed application does not proceed, then  thousands of jobs could be lost?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The question is about the development of  energy generation from biomass energy in order to create jobs. The Member&rsquo;s  question is about incineration, which is not relevant to the question, and is,  therefore, not appropriate.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>:  Will the Minister detail what assistance her Department is giving to landowners  who want to use their land to grow willow trees, rape, maize and other  sustainable biofuels?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: My Department is involved in a number of  issues, especially the creation of short-rotation coppice willow, which fits  that category. I do not have the detail to hand, but I will write to the Member  with details of what the Department is doing. The Department is working closely  with CAFRE and AFBI in order to develop the technology and products that would  fit into that source of renewable energy.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Recreational Use of Forests</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  McLaughlin </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development how she  intends to increase the recreational use of forests; and to outline the  rationale for the charging scheme for some activities. <a name=AQO3915/08>(AQO 3915/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Our forests offer great potential for  the development of recreation and public access opportunities for local people  and visitors. &lsquo;Northern Ireland Forestry &mdash; A Strategy for Sustainability and  Growth&rsquo;, which was published in March 2006, provides the policy framework for  Forest Service to make forests more widely available and to work with partners  in order to achieve that.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In line with the strategy, Forest Service is developing  proposals to identify partnership opportunities with private- and public-sector  organisations in order to improve the quality and range of recreation provision  in forests. That is expected to result in improved caravanning and camping  facilities, and the creation of recreation opportunities such as tree-top  adventure activities, making forests more attractive as recreational venues for  new and existing visitors, and contributing to the tourism agenda in the North.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to see the social use of forests continue and  develop. In that context, the Department will be publishing a social use and  recreation strategy later this year, which will set out a framework for social  use and recreation in the Department&rsquo;s forests.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The rationale for charging for services falls into several  distinct categories. For recreation provision similar to that which is  available from the private sector, the Department&rsquo;s aim is to set fees that  achieve full cost recovery. For forestry recreation provision of a  non-commercial nature, such as walking trails, charges are made at sites where  it is cost-effective to do so. In cases where Forest Service facilitates  specific events that are not directly associated with forestry provision, the  aim will be to recover costs where the activities are not commercial. For those  activities that generate a commercial return, the aim is to secure a share of  that return that reflects the contribution made to the business by the forest  asset.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I thank the Minister for that answer. She dwelt on the issue of social and  recreational use. Will the Minister elaborate on whether she sees potential as  regards the tourism agenda for the North?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I certainly do see such a potential, and  I raised that issue at the North/South Ministerial Council sectoral meeting  that I attended with Minister Dodds last week. Our forests offer great  potential to support the tourism agenda, and that is another area of  opportunity that I want to explore. It is especially relevant to those forests  that are included in the signature project areas, which have been identified by  the Tourist Board. Forest Service officials have been involved in discussions  about the possible contribution that forests can make to tourism; how that can  best be delivered, and occasions in which forming partnerships with other  interested providers can better realise the opportunities. I will ensure that  such work continues.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her optimistic assessment of the possibilities. Was she  talking merely about the possibilities in the forests that have full-time staff  employed by her Department, and that we all identify as having tourism  opportunities, or could more be done to add to the informal recreational  opportunities in a range of forests across the whole of Northern Ireland?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Some forests are outside my Department&rsquo;s  control, so I will not speak about them. However, any forests that come under  my Department&rsquo;s remit will be open for discussion. Some high-profile forests  would be a natural home for recreational activities, but I want to examine the  opportunities for other forests in other parts of the North so that we can also  maximise the tourism potential for those areas.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I am not sure whether the Minister is aware of the ever-increasing interest in  mountain biking in Northern    Ireland. Has the Minister had any  discussions with the mountain-biking fraternity about whether our forests can  be made suitable for that activity, because that would have potential tourism  benefits? Has she had any discussions with her counterpart in Scotland?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I have not had any such discussions with  my counterpart in Scotland.  However, I have had several discussions about the recreational opportunities  for forests with the Countryside Access and Activities Network (CAAN), which  has a remit for promoting mountain biking, and I would like to develop further  the potential for that activity.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We may need to seek partners, and we have spoken to  district councils and others to find ways of maximising the opportunities  without necessarily incurring all the cost under the DARD budget. Therefore, I  am happy to engage in those types of partnerships and to talk to relevant  parties about the issue.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 6 has been withdrawn.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Farming Industry: Attracting Young People</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  Kennedy </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development what  strategies are in place to attract young people as agricultural workers and new  entrants to the farming industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3844/08>(AQO  3844/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Young people are the future of the  agriculture industry, and I fully appreciate the importance of attracting young  people who have the necessary skills and competences to meet the needs of  agricultural businesses. My Department is doing its utmost to encourage new  entrants to the industry and to supply those young people with all the skills that  they need to move forward. The College   of Agriculture, Food and  Rural Enterprise offers 21 full- and part-time courses in agriculture and  related land-based services, ranging from NVQ level 2 to honours degree level,  to equip young people with the vital knowledge and skills for a successful  career in farming.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">College staff work closely with post-primary schools to  promote careers in the industry and the CAFRE programmes. Each year, schools  receive a college prospectus, associated promotional material, school visits  and briefings for careers teachers. College staff attend careers conventions  and major industry events and host open days for prospective students, parents  and careers advisers. Promotional articles and advertisements are published  regularly in the farming press.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I also commend the work of CAFRE, Lantra &mdash; the industry&rsquo;s  sector skills council &mdash; and the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and  Assessment, in preparing a land-based occupational studies option for the 14-  to 16-year-old age group in schools under the new entitle&shy;ment framework and  raising the profile of agriculture, food and rural environment among young  people.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As well as further and higher education programmes, CAFRE  will deliver agricultural training under the Department for Employment and  Learning&rsquo;s (DEL) new Training for Success initiative. I wish to ensure that our  highly innovative and successful multi-skilling programme, which helps young  people to combine off-farm employment with part-time farming, can continue  under the new framework. College staff are working with DEL and the regional colleges to secure that  outcome.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, my Department offers financial assistance to  new entrants to the farming industry. The new entrants&rsquo; scheme is still open to  young farmers under 40 who possess adequate competence and who are setting up  as head of a holding for the first time. The scheme provides an interest-rate  subsidy on loans for eligible projects that add value and make a positive  impact on the farming industry and the wider rural economy.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for the brevity of her answer. Despite what the Minister  said, does she not agree that the new entrants&rsquo; scheme has not experienced the  expected uptake? Will she ensure that greater flexibility will be built into  future schemes?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: We have consulted widely on the new  entrants&rsquo; scheme, and I am particularly interested to hear the Young Farmers&rsquo;  Clubs&rsquo; opinion on the scheme and possible improvements. We have extended the  deadline for the new entrants&rsquo; scheme to encourage as many young people as  possible to take up that money. Furthermore, there will be another publicity  drive this week. We want to attract more new entrants, and I recognise that,  last year, people were busy with the farm nutrient management scheme, which  might have discouraged uptake in the interim period. However, by and large, the  Department will do its utmost to attract new entrants into the industry and to  ensure its long-term viability.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  Given the current financial realities in the farming industry, will the  Minister acknowledge the need to adopt a wider twin-track approach to that  issue? The scheme is necessary to permit senior members of farming families to  retire and to attract vital new blood to the industry. Has such a detailed  strategy been devised and presented to the industry?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I have discussed that issue with  officials; in fact, in my first day in the job, that issue arose during  discussions with senior members of the Department. After in-depth examination,  farming organisations have told us clearly that, if the budget is limited, they  would prefer an investment in young people rather than helping farmers to  retire. It was felt that the single farm payment would help to cushion retiring  farmers. The Member is, perhaps, thinking of the scheme in the Twenty-six  Counties, whereby much more money was available, which enabled funding for both  groups. Unfortunately, we do not have access to that level of funding.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her answer.  Has she assessed the payment rates outlined in the minimum wage regulations for  agricultural workers?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: That is a timely question because, in  October 2007, the Assembly debated the Agricultural Wages Board and the  protection of the minimum wage structure for agricultural workers. We accept  that farmers and farm workers must receive a level of pay that encourages them  to join the industry, or it will be difficult to attract and retain workers in  the sector. Therefore, it is a timely issue, and I will keep my eye on the ball  in that regard.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Local Action Groups</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mr  Molloy </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development for an  update on having local action groups as part of the rural development programme  2007-2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3917/08>(AQO 3917/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Seven council clusters are in place,  which have been conducting the animation of the rural areas and have either  held &mdash; or are holding &mdash; a competitive call for the formation of a local action  group. To date, four local action groups have been formed: Ards &mdash; covering  Ards, Down, North Down and Banbridge council areas; Antrim &mdash; covering Antrim,  Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey council areas; Cookstown &mdash; covering Cookstown,  Fermanagh, Magherafelt and Dungannon and South Tyrone council areas; Omagh &mdash;  covering Omagh, Strabane, Limavady and Derry council areas.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Their documentation has been passed to my Department for  ratification, ensuring that equality is addressed and that they represent all  groups, as defined by section 75.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her answer. What progress has been made under existing  arrangements?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: To date, all seven clusters have agreed,  through full council, to work together to deliver the programme. As I said,  four of the clusters have completed the animation process and have, through a  competitive process, formed local action groups. One cluster is in the final  stages of selecting a local action group, and two clusters are completing their  animation phase and opening a call for a local action group. Consultants have  been appointed in all areas to start work on the rural development strategies,  and my Department issued an invitation to all clusters to submit strategies by  31 July 2008.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  Will the Minister explain why all councils were not notified of the  miscalculations that were made in relation to the first &pound;50 million of the rural  development fund? I know that the Minister notified all lead councils; however,  would it not have been prudent to notify all councils of those serious mistakes?</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: As I said, the figures were based on an  erroneous application by officials of the methodology for calculating  deprivation and were, therefore, incorrect. That mistake was brought to my  attention by members of my party. I have instructed my officials to recalculate  the figures, and I have given information about that today. My Department is  working with the lead council concerned and is giving it space to do so,  because there is no point in duplicating that work. The figures were announced  today, and I expect the lead council to talk to the other councils in its  cluster.</p>
	        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="9"></a>Culture, Arts And Leisure</p>
	        <p class="H4StageHeading">Subregional Creative Clusters</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Loan </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure what support is  available to subregional creative clusters in the community and voluntary  sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3892/08>(AQO 3892/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr Poots)</strong>: In conjunction with other Departments  and Invest Northern Ireland,  my Department is developing a strategy to support and develop the  creative-industries sector. I have secured &pound;5 million over the next three years  to deliver a creative-industries seed fund, which will provide support for  creative businesses and sectoral initiatives. The detailed criteria for the  fund are being determined, and I expect that the fund will be open to  applications by autumn 2008.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Creative practitioners and businesses often develop in  proximity to each other, and clustering fosters connections that are of mutual  benefit. Examples of creative clusters involving the community and voluntary sectors  can be found in the Cathedral Quarter of Belfast and the Nerve Centre in Londonderry. There are several sources of support for  those initiatives, including the Arts Council, Northern Ireland Screen and  local councils. Several councils have made significant investments in their  arts infrastructures, which provide hubs for creative activities across Northern Ireland.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that there is robust international evidence that strong  economic performance occurs in regions with a thriving arts sector and that the  arts are a driver of strong economic performance, rather than merely a result  of it? Given that our community-based arts organisations are currently delivering  arts on a shoestring, will he do everything that he can to increase support for  the community-based arts sector?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I am not sure where the Member has been, but  there was a significant debate on the arts during the Budget deliberations.  Prior to that debate, people involved in the arts had been complaining strongly  that their budgets were not good enough and that provision for the arts in the  draft Budget was not good enough. My Department made substantial gains during  the final Budget process. I have already told the House that &pound;5 million will go  into a creative industries seed fund over the next five years. I am glad that  the Member is now aware of what happened some months ago.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. Derry styles itself, like Galway,  as a place where creative culture flourishes. I am sure that the Minister is  aware of the work that is going on in the Magee campus of the university there  and in the Nerve Centre. What support or interest is his Department  demonstrating in supporting creative clusters, especially in the Foyle and  wider north-west areas?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Again, I am fascinated that someone from the  Foyle constituency would not know or understand what has been going on in the  creative industries there. The Nerve Centre is supported by my Department. The  north-west challenge fund has distributed &pound;4 million in that constituency.  Therefore, it is clear that a great deal has been going on in the arts in that  city, and I am glad to be able to bring the Member up to speed on that this  afternoon.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Time beat me, Mr Speaker, in welcoming the new First Minister personally. I do  not know what the future holds for Minister Poots. However, I take this  opportunity to thank him for his courtesy to me, which I hope continues.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister tell the House what level of official  departmental support he has had in developing the creative clusters,  particularly in the context of business opportunities?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I thank the Member for his remarks. Mr Poots&rsquo;s  future will be very good, because it is in the Lord&rsquo;s hands, and I am very  happy to be in His hands.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">My Department aspires to develop creative clusters. In Northern Ireland,  34,600 people are engaged in creative activities, which results in employment  of around 4&middot;7% of the population. Although it has often been viewed as a  Cinderella sector providing few employment opportunities, it is one of the more  significant employment sectors in Northern Ireland. My Department  will work with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to ensure  that people who have the skills to bring schemes forward can work with those  who have the business acumen to develop them further. That is already happening  in such places as The Nerve Centre and Belfast&rsquo;s  Cathedral Quarter.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Increasing Participation in Sports</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  McFarland </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure how he intends to  increase participation in sports by people in groups with current low rates of  participation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3837/08>(AQO 3837/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The draft &lsquo;The Northern Ireland Strategy for  Sport &amp; Physical Recreation 2007-2017&rsquo;, which I published for consultation  last October, proposes several targets and actions to increase participation in  sports by people in groups with current low rates of participation. The Budget  2008-2011 provides a total of &pound;145 million for sport, and it is my intention,  in conjunction with Sport Northern Ireland, to deploy part of that resource to  help increase participation in sport among people in groups with low  participation rates, as identified in the draft strategy for sport and physical  recreation.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  The draft strategy, which was published last October, stated that women, people  on low incomes and people with disabilities were seriously under-represented in  sport. Will the Minister tell the House exactly what he has done in the last  nine months to improve the levels of participation of people in those  categories?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: We are developing a strategy for sport, and we  have set increased participation targets of 6% for women, people with physical  and learning disabilities and people from deprived backgrounds to engage in  sport and physical recreation. Achieving those targets will involve identifying  greater numbers of coaches and developing more community-based places for sport  delivery.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We lost significant lottery funding, but we managed to  replace it. Thirteen programmes that applied for the lottery funding were told  that they could not proceed. Not only will those programmes now go ahead, but  we will be able to progress many others. Much work has been done, and I thank  the Member for his interest in the issue.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Has the Minister had any discussions  with his counterpart in the Scottish Executive, which made the decision to  invest money from its health budget in sport, because of its health benefits?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Yes. I travelled to Scotland and had discussions with  the Scottish Minister. He subsequently visited Northern Ireland and he was very  impressed by our multi-use games areas, where schools and councils have joined  together to provide opportunities for sport. There can be absolutely no doubt  that sport is one key area through which we can challenge poor health resulting  from obesity and weight problems and can help to prevent conditions such as  diabetes and colon cancer. We hope to encourage people to get people involved  in physical recreation.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Special Olympics Ireland</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mrs  O&rsquo;Neill </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure how his Department  will assist Special Olympics Ireland to continue the growth of the Special  Olympics Programme.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3886/08>(AQO 3886/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: My Department and the whole Northern Ireland  Government have been supportive of Special Olympics Ireland. In 2003, Special  Olympics Ireland received &pound;1,184,000 towards the cost of hosting the world  games. In 2006, my Department contributed &pound;500,000 towards the cost of hosting  the games here in Belfast  and surrounding areas.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Special Olympics Ireland has prepared an operational plan  for 2008-2011 for Special Olympics Ulster, which it will present to several  Ministers soon. After that presentation, it would be appropriate for the  Ministers involved to discuss and agree the way forward.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the Minister place the item on  the agenda of his next North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meeting with the  Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Mr Martin Cullen TD? Has the NSMC ever  received a presentation from Special Olympics Ireland about the importance of  its work?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: No.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  The Minister will be aware of an increase of 3,000 in the number of athletes  participating in Special Olympics activities since 2003. Indeed, athlete  numbers have doubled since 2000. How many of those 3,000 new athletes are from Northern Ireland?  What is the percentage increase in participation in Northern Ireland since 2000?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: A considerable number of people from Northern Ireland  &mdash; and, particularly, from Special Olympics Ulster &mdash; are participating in those  activities. I was delighted to host an evening, earlier this year, for young  people who participated in the Special Olympics in Shanghai, many of whom returned home with large  numbers of medals. Those Special Olympics athletes are showing the way forward.  I will provide Lord Browne with the figures for Northern Ireland participants in  writing.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: How  has the Special Olympics movement developed in Northern   Ireland since Belfast  hosted the games two years ago?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Special Olympics groups have developed well.  Our young athletes&rsquo; considerable success in last year&rsquo;s games is a  demonstration of that. An operational plan was due to be presented to the  junior Ministers and Ministers McGimpsey, Ruane, Ritchie and myself on 5 June.  Unfortunately, that meeting was postponed because of scheduling difficulties,  but it will take place in the near future.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Community Festival Funding</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr Moutray </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure what take-up there has been  by local councils of funding for community festivals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3895/08>(AQO 3895/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: To date, 22 councils have responded to accept  the offer of community festivals funding. Three councils &mdash; Craigavon, Derry City  and Ballymoney &mdash; have indicated that they intend to accept the offer. Belfast  City Council has yet to formally respond to the offer.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer, and I welcome the fact that some councils  have either already taken up the provision or are about to do so. Groups in the  unionist community, particularly the Loyal Orders, have routinely lost out in  the allocation of funding. Will the Minister&rsquo;s initiative reverse the  scandalous inequality in funding allocation?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I hope that it will. Last year, organisations  that could be identified as having a unionist background received less than 10%  of a fund of over &pound;400,000. Councils should do a considerably better job in  ensuring the more equitable delivery of funding.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am disappointed that Belfast City Council has not yet  formally responded to the offer of funding. Indeed, it is shocking that some of  those people holding up the process are Ulster Unionist councillors. On the one  hand, organisers of Orangefest in Belfast  are writing to me, asking me to move things forward. On the other hand, people  such as Councillor Bob Stoker are holding the entire process back.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Does the Minister agree that funding  for festivals in Belfast  has been greatly reduced? Will he detail what funding has been given to F&eacute;ile an Phobail this year?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Councils are supposed to match fund what is  offered by the Department. If Belfast City Council match fund what the  Department has offered, it would have the same amount of money to distribute to  the festival organisers as it did last year. The lady from Sandy Row who complained  bitterly about not receiving funding was right. The funding necessary for that  festival could be in place if Belfast City Council moves forward.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Councils such as Ballymena, Newtownabbey,  Ards and Strabane, which previously received nothing, will receive funding  under the scheme.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Councils across the Province are reporting back to me that  that the funding offer has proven successful, and that they have had 20 or 25  applications for festival funding, which they can approve. Councils are saying  that that is a good-news story for their constituencies and for Northern Ireland  &mdash; I encourage Belfast City Council to join in that good-news story.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  The Ulster Fle&aacute; Cheoil will be held in Castlewellan this year between 21 July  and 27 July. Does the Minister agree that ministerial attendance at that major  cultural event is very important?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I did not hear the name of the event about which  Mr Bradley asked.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member clarify his supple&shy;mentary question?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I asked about the Ulster Fle&aacute; Cheoil.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: My ratio of attendance at events to requests  that have I receive to attend them is very high. Whenever that request comes  in, it will be considered.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Active Places NI Website</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  Armstrong </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure how his  Department is promoting the Active Places NI (www.activeplacesni.net) website.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3833/08>(AQO 3833/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Active Places Northern Ireland website was  developed by Sport Northern Ireland (SNI) with the co-operation of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  district councils, sports&rsquo; governing bodies, the education sector and other  stakeholders. The website is being promoted through the SNI website, which is  due to be relaunched in July. Active Places NI is also promoted on all  SNI-designed publications, such as SportsZone and Sportsline, and the web  address is prevalent on SNI business cards.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  Active Places promotes 5,500 sporting opportunities across Northern Ireland.  Will the Minister indicate whether any geographical areas are significantly  under-represented in that spread of opportunities?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: One would assume that if 5,500 places are promoted  across Northern Ireland,  most of Northern Ireland  is covered.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I have a very quick question: are there any plans to review or indeed improve  the Active Places NI website in any way?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The website is not particularly old. Given the  nature of the rate of IT development, however, such matters are under regular  review.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Is financial assistance provided to individuals who, in order to train and  prepare in their pursuit of excellence, must travel from rural areas to greater  Belfast or  Lisburn to access sporting facilities?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: That is a very interesting question, which bears  absolutely no relevance to websites.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Upgrading Football Stadia</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  Kennedy </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure what action he  intends to take to upgrade football stadia before the 2012 Olympics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3842/08>(AQO 3842/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mr  Campbell </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure what the total  cost is to the public purse of applications or proposals from Irish League  Football Clubs to renovate or refurbish their stadia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3820/08>(AQO 3820/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: With your permission Mr Speaker, I shall take  questions 6 and 8 together. Responsibility for upgrading football stadia before  the 2012 Olympics rests with those venues&rsquo; owners. However, Sport Northern  Ireland, which is responsible for the development of sport &mdash; including the  distribution of funding &mdash; has been running a number of Exchequer and lottery  programmes to which the owners of football stadia are eligible to apply. Those  include the lottery&rsquo;s Building Sport programme and two Exchequer programmes &mdash;  the stadia-safety programme and the soccer strategy.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The total anticipated cost to the public purse for  applications or proposals that have been received to date from Irish League  football clubs to renovate or refurbish their stadia under SNI&rsquo;s stadia-safety programme  is &pound;5&middot;9 million. The Irish Football Association (IFA) is planning to launch a  capital programme to assist Irish League clubs to meet new UEFA licensing  requirements, and new IFA Premier League and Premier Intermediate League  facility requirements. The SNI has agreed to provide up to &pound;3&middot;56 million to  assist the IFA in implementing that programme.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I have been reviewing sports facilities&rsquo; spend  patterns more generally in light of the sports-places targets proposed in the Northern Ireland  strategy for sport and physical recreation, which I published for consultation  last October.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As a result of that, I plan to initiate a sports-places  modernisation programme, using the available capital budget for sport that was  announced in the recent Budget. That programme will be open to all sports, including  football, and will allow capital moneys to be used more flexibly in  facilitating the delivery of the places target that is emerging from the Northern Ireland  sport strategy.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Can the Minister outline what discussions, if any, he has  had with the Irish Football Association or any other body regarding the  provision of a new or upgraded Northern    Ireland national soccer stadium at a  location other than the Maze?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I have had a number of discussions with the IFA,  which has put its cards on the table: it wishes to proceed with the project at  the Maze. It has not indicated that it wishes to proceed with any other  project.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I have had separate discussions with Linfield Football Club  about the potential to upgrade Windsor   Park. That could only  happen if rugby was involved in some way to generate the additional income that  would be required for the investment. Both football and rugby need more income,  and the way in which they can generate that is to have more people attend their  matches. The longer that this debate goes on, and the longer the  procrastination goes on, the longer those two particular sports will suffer. We  politicians must bear some of the responsibility for that.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Can the Minister say whether the announcement that he is making about the  additional moneys that sports, including football, can access might allow  Coleraine Football Club, at the Showgrounds, for example, or Institute Football  Club, at the Riverside in Londonderry,  to avail themselves of funds to develop their respective grounds?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The modernisation fund that has been referred to  will allow a variety of sports to apply for funding for stadiums. Stadiums in Northern Ireland  are in a fairly decrepit state, and I have had a number of meetings with, for  example, Coleraine Borough Council in relation to the Coleraine Showgrounds.  The council is looking at potential opportunities, including the possibility of  relocation. It is very important that there be a quality facility there, given  that it is the home of the Milk Cup &mdash; many teams participate in that particular  competition, and it is a high-profile event for Northern Ireland. The answer is  that yes, sports organisations in general can apply to this fund, and Coleraine  and Drumahoe are not excluded from applying.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Does the delay in reaching a decision  about the multi-sports stadium at the Long Kesh site effectively mean that we  have missed the boat on hosting important football matches in association with  the 2012 Olympics? Does the Minister plead guilty to the charge of failing to  be decisive when decisiveness and leadership were called for within his Department?  Furthermore, does he fancy Tyrone&rsquo;s chances against Down next Saturday?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: It was not a decision to be made exclusively by  my Department. It is a cross-cutting issue, and I do not want to be like other  Ministers who thought that they would be decisive, but only ended up being  divisive and not being able to deliver. We could still get the 2012 Olympics,  should we move ahead in the not-too-distant future.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  In fairness to the Minister, I think that he was decisive in his own mind &mdash;  other people prevented him from implementing the strategy in relation to the  Maze stadium.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In the light of the serious delay in decision-making, is  there a real chance of facilities being ready so that we can benefit in some  way from the London Olympic Games?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: There would be a one-year planning process and a  two-year building process, so it is really down to the decision-making process.  It takes three years, and the closer you get to that, the less of a chance  there is of it happening. It is as simple as that.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Sport NI and the Irish Sports Council: Co-operation</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr W  Clarke </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to detail the extent  and character of co-operation between Sport NI and the Irish Sports Council.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3882/08>(AQO 3882/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Sport NI and the Irish Sports Council co-operate  on an ongoing basis to develop all-island sport and on issues of common  concern.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">That co-operation takes various forms, including regular  meetings of an all-Ireland planning committee, made up of representatives of  both organisations; joint meetings with the 37 all-Ireland sports governing  bodies to optimise development in those sports; a jointly organised biannual  all-Ireland sports conference; and the formulation of joint policy such as a  code of ethics and good practice for children&rsquo;s sport.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his succinct response. Has he held meetings with his  counterpart in the South in relation to making a bid to host a major UEFA  European football championship? Furthermore, does the Minister agree that such  a bid could be made by a Celtic alliance that could include the North of  Ireland, the South of Ireland, Wales  and Scotland?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Previously, a bid was made for the 2011 UEFA  Under-21 European Championship. That bid has now been withdrawn. The IFA worked  with the FAI on that bid, but the lack of a suitable stadium in Northern Ireland  prevented that from proceeding.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Will the Minister tell us why Northern    Ireland schools are participating in every  event of the UK School Games with the sole exception of swimming? Is it true  that the participation of swimming clubs in Northern Ireland has been blocked  because they are affiliated to an all-Ireland institution?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. The UK  School Games is hugely beneficial, and many young people from Northern Ireland  participate in them. I confirm that many young people participate in Northern  Ireland-only teams, but that swimmers are prevented from participating. My  understanding is that the Irish Schools&rsquo; Swimming Association, which organised  the swimming teams, has pulled out of the games, and Northern Ireland schools are not  allowed to enter children in the games. That is hugely unfortunate and it is a  matter that must be resolved. The UK School Games should not discriminate  against one region of the United Kingdom  by preventing children from this part of the UK from participating in that great  event.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Foras na Gaeilge</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">9. <strong>Mr A  Maskey </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure if Foras na Gaeilge  will fund capital development projects in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3884/08>(AQO 3884/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: There is no provision for Foras na Gaeilge to  operate a capital-funding programme in Northern Ireland. No provision has  been made in the comprehensive spending review for it to fund  capital-development projects for the next three years.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  A Cheann Comhairle, I thank the Minister for his response. In some of his  earlier responses, the Minister has been rather abrupt and his responses have  been totally inappropriate. I am not sure whether to thank the Minister or to  wish him sl&aacute;n go f&oacute;ill, because I know that he is having a difficult day.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">My supplementary question is to ask the Minister whether  there is any prospect of capital-grant support for organisations such as An  Droichead on the Ormeau Road  in south Belfast.  An Droichead is currently the only project of that nature in that part of the  city. That project is seeking to expand and develop in order to introduce  training and conference facilities, which may be used by the wider community  and bring additional tourism into an area of disadvantage.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Neither Foras na Gaeilge nor the Ulster-Scots  Agency, both agencies of the North/South Language Body, fund capital-development  projects. No provision is made for that in the comprehensive spending review,  nor is there a mechanism to deliver it.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  What assessment has the Minister made of those proposals, and how likely are  they to be implemented? What criteria will be used to determine the viability  of such projects?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Prior to devolution, a bid was made through the  integrated development fund for a Gaeltacht quarter in west Belfast. My Department is currently considering  that matter. We have asked for an economic appraisal of the proposal. To be  implemented, it will have to meet the recognised standards of economic  appraisal. There is no question that such a project would be implemented if it  does not meet green-book standards. We have applied that stop check.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Events Strategy</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">10. <strong>Mr  Durkan </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to outline progress  in the formulation of the events strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3859/08>(AQO  3859/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Following the discovery of serious financial and  corporate governance weaknesses at the Northern Ireland Events Company,  responsibility for its functions has passed directly to my Department and has  been administered by the DCAL events unit since April 2008. Therefore, we are  still open for business, but under new management.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Officials from DCAL, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board  (NITB) and DETI are working on a strategy to transfer the events function to  NITB which will develop and deliver a 10-year events strategy. That strategy is  subject to the successful completion of a due diligence exercise on the events  function and to agreement between the Ministers from DETI and DCAL.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In the interim, calls for applications to the events growth  fund and the major events fund were advertised on 28 March 2008, with a closing  date of 2 May 2008. A total of 26 applications were received to both funds and  these are being processed.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker, a Cheann Comhairle. Further to Alex Maskey&rsquo;s  comments about the Minister&rsquo;s being very abrupt in the last session, his  answers to supplementary questions posed by Members on this side of the House  failed to meet even the basic standard of courtesy and detail. I ask the  Speaker to examine the Hansard report and rule appropriately on whether the  Minister exhibited bad manners during the past half hour.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  As I have said to all sides of the House, on many occasions, it is not up to  the Speaker to decide how a Minister answers a question or a supplementary  question. The Minister gave long answers to some Members.</p>

	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Leas &mdash; gabh mo leithsc&eacute;al &mdash; a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to comment on some issues  relating to education and to the children and young people&rsquo;s fund.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The extended schools programme, mentioned by other Members  today, was directed to the areas of greatest need. It was, to all intents and purposes,  a form of early intervention, aimed at counteracting the effects of social  disadvantage. Similar aims lie behind the community-and voluntary-run  school-age childcare schemes, many of which are running out of funds. In fact,  some may have done so by the end of this month. They have provided an excellent  service and have worked in areas of great social disadvantage.</p>
	        <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The philosophy of early intervention that lay behind extended  schools was correct. However, it can be effective only if it is applied and  resourced consistently. On-off, or reduced, resourcing amounts to nothing more  than short-termism, which can have only limited, short-term benefits.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Although the aims were laudable, they were not supported by  strong, underpinning policy. In some cases, schools received funding and, after  initiating their own schemes, received the guidelines three to six months  later. Furthermore, links between the schools and the local community were, in  many cases, not explored, resulting in the displacement of local services  provided by the voluntary and community sectors.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The reduction in the extended schools budget reduces  drastically the services that schools can offer. That, coupled with the effect  of displacement of community and voluntary school-age childcare services,  leaves a huge gap in provision that will be difficult to fill without an  increase in resources.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Guaranteed, core funding is needed in the longer term. That  will allow the advantages of intervention to continue into the future and will  ensure that the maximum benefit is received.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">If the policy arguments of this issue are strong, the  politics of it are shocking. At the time of the Budget, the SDLP raised  concerns about the abolition of the Executive children&rsquo;s fund &mdash; a cross-cutting  fund to deliver on programmes, such as childcare, with obvious connections to  education, employment, the economy and social care.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Executive colleagues told us that children&rsquo;s programmes  would not suffer; they told us that we were playing politics. However, the  extended schools programme and the school-age childcare programmes are in  danger of going to the wall. The two main parties &mdash; the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in &mdash; are  playing the politics of mutual self-interest at the expense of the economy,  children and working parents.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth recalling their commitments when the  re-establishment of the ministerial subcommittee on children and young people  was being debated. Junior Minister Paisley claimed:</p>
	        <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;We are confident that the available funding should mean that  no child or youth programme will be reduced or cut.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Official  Report, Vol 27, No 3, p 173, col 1].</span></p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Minister Kelly agreed with his colleague and said  that:</p>
	        <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;the Budget was good for children&rdquo;. <span class="Italic">[Official  Report, Vol 27, No 3, p 175, col 1].</span></p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is not the current situation.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">At least the Minster of Education is consistent. She failed  to seek funding for the reform of education in the Budget, and she also failed  to seek funding for school-age childcare. Now we are to hold our breaths to see  what in-year monitoring can do to save her blushes. I support her bid for &pound;5  million in resource funding for extended schools, but I do not hold out much  hope for success &mdash; a feeling shared by her departmental officials. Last Friday,  they informed the Committee for Education that they are far from confident that  the bid will succeed.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Although I welcome the uplift of &pound;12 million towards  providing more administrative time for teaching principals, that underlines, in  many ways, the huge anomalies that exist in education funding in Northern  Ireland. Primary school principals &mdash; who will meet here on Wednesday &mdash; express  their exasperation daily at a system that makes it difficult to attain the  smaller class sizes that are required to achieve the outcomes that we want to  see from primary education.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Principals and primary-school teachers are, rightly,  seeking parity with their secondary colleagues in preparation, planning and  assessment times; more and better learning resources; more support staff; and  more management support. Those are serious issues to which Members must give  serious consideration and take action to tackle.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, the reforms envisaged by the Minister of  Education have not been costed. The Minister believes that reform can be  achieved through tweaking, in some way, the present system. However, if reforms  have not been costed, how does the Minister know what resources will or will  not be required? We may well find ourselves embarking on a programme of reform  without the necessary resources to implement it. Where will we be if that is  the case?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP supports extended schools, but not all schools are  taking up the option &mdash; even if they are properly funded. It is not a panacea.  School-age childcare schemes also provide a vital service. They are targeted at  areas of social deprivation, and they aim to help to get parents off benefits  and into work. The Executive said that the economy was their priority, and they  have a golden opportunity now, at a modest cost, to get people back into the workforce.  Even if Ministers ignore the social argument, they should appreciate the  financial case &mdash; the cost of a childcare place is much lower than the cost of  benefits for parents.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There are important questions to be asked. Why has the  Minister of Education not made a bid for the social-economy school-age  childcare schemes, which will run out of funding at the end of this month?  There seems to be an ongoing argument among several Departments &mdash; a game of  pass the parcel &mdash; which is not good enough on this serious issue.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Why do Ministers not appreciate that the cost of a  childcare place is lower than that of benefits? Can they not do the sums? Does  the Minister accept that a cross-cutting fund for cross-cutting issues of such  central importance is one of the best ways to provide services on a stable and  coherent basis?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  We were told by other parties that cross-cutting funds of themselves did not  work. We were also assured that the funding for children and young people was  being ring-fenced into three Departments &mdash; Culture, Arts and Leisure, Health,  and Education &mdash; only to find that Education could not sustain the very  programmes that were funded.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Member agree that cross-cutting funding is the  only way to stop what he called the &ldquo;pass the parcel&rdquo; exercise, in which people  are referred from one Department to another, each of which sympathises and  encourages, but then refuses funding?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I totally agree with the Member and thank him for the points that he made.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive are seen to lack strategy and leadership.  They talk economy but do not deliver, even when opportunities are there for the  taking. In their self-interested collaboration and the phoney war that was  played out last week, they let vital issues go to the wall. That is totally  unacceptable.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We all promised that devolution would improve the lives of  people in Northern Ireland.  However, what I have outlined are vital areas that have not been improved. Not  only are they not being improved, but they are being &ldquo;dis-improved&rdquo;.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We also see certain Ministers reflect their own prejudices  in the way in which funding is allocated within some Departments. We have seen  an example of that in the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, with the  underfunding of the Irish language. An examination of the percentage increase  given to Ulster Scots &mdash;</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I allowed an intervention; I am allowed  an extra minute.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: On a ten-minute speech, no extra time is allowed for an  intervention.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I apologise. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  More money for the health budget there &mdash; I think that there is a bit of a  crisis somewhere in the Chamber. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Maybe you should check the acoustics, Mr Deputy Speaker.  There seems to be a problem with the sound.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The debate is a necessary part of the seemingly  interminable and ever-ongoing budgetary process in this House. Budgets, Finance  Bills, even Supply resolution debates are characterised by calls for more money  for this or that. Members have not disappointed. From all sides of the House,  they have called for additional sums of money for various projects that are  dear to their hearts.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Another common occurrence &mdash; and today&rsquo;s debate has been no  different &mdash; is to blame the poor Finance Minister, or the Department of Finance  generally, for a lack of funding here or a lack of funding there. Minister  Foster must be glad that she is only temporarily filling the Finance Minister&rsquo;s  shoes, and will not be subjected to such criticism in the longer term.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">An example of such behaviour comes from a perhaps not  unexpected, but, nevertheless, unfortunate, quarter &mdash; a Minister. During a  debate in this House on 20 May on funding for extended schools, Minister Ruane  said some things unbecoming of a Minister or any Member of this House. I have a  range of quotes, but I will start with this one:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;All Members who spoke talked about the extended  schools programme &mdash; and it is a good programme. Why has it been cut? It has  been cut because the Department of Finance and Personnel has not provided the  finances for it to proceed in its current form.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 30,  No 7, p378, col 2].</span></span></p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is the sort of excuse or response that might  be expected from others, but certainly not from a Minister who signed off on  the Budget, both in the Executive and in the Assembly.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is patent nonsense and, in many respects, does not stand  up to scrutiny. The Minister has acknowledged that the funding gap for the  extended schools programme is around &pound;4 million &mdash; 0&middot;2% of the funds available  to her out of a budget of almost &pound;1&middot;8 billion.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">During the budgetary process, of which today&rsquo;s debate is an  element, the Department of Education received the fourth-highest budget uplift  of all Departments over the period 2008-2011, with an additional spending power  of over &pound;400 million, which will be available by the end of the Budget period.  If, considering the Minister&rsquo;s comments, those facts were not damning enough,  Members should remember that her Department was unable to spend almost &pound;100  million in funds that were available to it last year, making it one of the  worst-performing Departments in the Northern Ireland Executive.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">All Departments have difficult choices to make, which  sometimes involve scaling back some services in order to fund improvements  elsewhere. Sadly, instead of Minister Ruane defending her decision, she has  opted for the easy choice of blaming the Department of Finance and Personnel.  Continuing on the same theme, during the aforementioned debate, the Minister of  Education stated:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;As recently as last month, I wrote again to the  Finance Minister to describe the negative impact that reduced funding would  have on the extended schools programme. I asked him to consider making further  resources available, and I will continue to press the issue.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Vol 30, No 7, p378, col 2].</span></span></p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In that debate, she also said:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;On 7 January 2008, I again wrote to the Finance  Minister to make him aware that concerns had been raised during public  consultation on the Budget in relation to the removal of children and young  people&rsquo;s funding from departmental baselines, and my inability to fill that gap  given the proposed allocation. Did he listen to that public consultation? No,  he did not.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 30, No 7, p380, col 1].</span></span></p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The accusation that the Minister of Finance and Personnel  ignored the issue of education is not supported by even the most elementary  scrutiny of the facts.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In the time between the draft Budget being announced on 5  October 2007 and the Final Stage of the Budget Bill on 26 February 2008, the  allocation to the Department of Education was increased by some &pound;24 million in  addition to, I understand, other increases that were made throughout the  budgetary process. Of the additional &pound;24 million, &pound;13 million was specifically  set aside for children and young people&rsquo;s projects of the type that we are  debating.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As all Members will recall, the Minister of Finance and  Personnel also responded positively to arguments that were made during the  public consultation on the draft Budget about the allocation for everything  from health &mdash; specifically, mental health &mdash; to the arts and to social housing.  Clearly, the Minister of Finance and Personnel responded to calls on the finite  resources at his disposal, including the Department of Education. He responded  positively to the public. It is not so clear whether the Minister of Education  did that for the extended schools programme.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is disappointing &mdash; if not, sometimes, unexpected &mdash; when  a private Member takes the easy path of attacking the Department of Finance and  Personnel for its Budget allocation without considering fundamental questions  such as where the extra money will come from &mdash; for example, from higher rates  or cutbacks in services &mdash; but it is all the more so when it comes from a  Minister who was a major player in the budgetary process.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  note the seriousness with which the Member is considering these points. However,  surely questions can be asked not only of the Minister of Education but of the  junior Ministers in the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister?  During the debates on the Budget and the Programme for Government, the junior  Ministers gave specific assurances that all the money that was in the children  and young people&rsquo;s funding package was being ring-fenced in three Departments&rsquo;  budgets &mdash; including that of the Department of Education &mdash; and assured the House  that there would be no cut in the funding for the programmes that were  previously supported.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Why have the junior Ministers not ensured that the money  that supposedly went to the Department of Education was used to support the  extended schools programme? The questions that Mr Hamilton raises do not refer  only to what was said by the Minister of Education but to what other Ministers  were telling us at the time of the debates on the Programme for Government and  the Budget.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I know that the Member has serious concerns about this issue, and he has  expressed them previously in the Chamber.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The point that I am making &mdash; which has, today, been raised  not only by me but by the Member&rsquo;s colleague, as well as other Members &mdash; is  that the Minister of Education has pleaded that the Minister of Finance and  Personnel gave her no assistance whatsoever or any additional money, but, when  the facts are examined, it is clear that she did receive additional money.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Given the Member&rsquo;s experience, he will know better than  most that the Minister of Education must prioritise the extended schools  programme and make funds available to it if she considers it to be a good  programme, which is exactly what she said in the debate on 20 May 2008.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Additional funds were made available to the Minister, and  it was up to her to prioritise that. It is disappointing when a Minister, after  signing off on &mdash; and voting for &mdash; the Budget in the Executive and the House,  blames the Minister of Finance and Personnel for a lack of funding. The  Minister had ample opportunity to secure more money for those programmes and  would not have had to rely on end-year funding.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Although one expects a humble Back-Bencher like myself to  call for more money for various projects &mdash;</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Not for much longer.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  We would love to see the light before the end of the day.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Although one might expect such behaviour from a  Back-Bencher, it is not becoming of a Minister. The Minister is fond of  speaking every language under the sun in the House, but it would be good if she  spoke some sense.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I have listened to the debate with  interest &mdash; it has degenerated into a finger-pointing exercise between Members  about how Ministers from other parties run their Departments and how much  better run those Departments would be if they were controlled by the party of  those Members. I am not sure that that assists us in our long-term project to  manage our finances in this part of the world.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We deal with a block grant from the British Exchequer,  which means that there is a set Budget that we must divide as best as possible.  Until the Assembly grasps the nettle and deals with its own economic destiny,  the squabble over who should have got more of the pie will continue.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We are not dealing with the economic questions that we face  in the short and long term &mdash; some parties shy away from taking responsibility  for tax-varying and other powers. They believe that continuing in a subservient  fashion will solve the problems that many in our society face &mdash; it will not.  Until we establish an all-Ireland economy and until we establish our own  economic independence, we will not be able to solve the problems that we face  in our society daily.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">From one humble Back-Bencher to another, I want to respond  to several of the points made by Members, particularly those about the  Department of Education. If we are going to have a debate about the block  grant, we must use the facts that are before us. Since the debate on extended  schools funding, I am surprised at how often the DUP has denied the claims that  were made by the Minister of Education. I did not study Shakespeare, but I  think that it was &mdash; <span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">[Interruption.]</span></span></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  He was English.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  There is a rumour that he was, but we will not claim that yet.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There is a Shakespeare play with the famous line: he  denieth too much. DUP Members denieth too much. At every opportunity, they tell  the House that the Minister of Education did not ask for more money, that the  lack of funding was not the fault of the Department of Finance and Personnel  and that there was plenty of money in the kitty, and so on.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  Member is a new member of the Education Committee, and I am keen to improve  education where possible. The correct quote is: he doth protest too much. I am  always keen to help the opposite side.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  am always keen to take on more knowledge. However, that does not change the  point that I made.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Like every other Department, the Department of Education  must make hard decisions and deal with the finances that are before it. The  Minister ring-fenced as much money as she could to ensure that the extended  schools programme operates in as many schools as possible, but there was not  enough money in the Budget to go around.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Member accept that Ministers must take difficult decisions, and that,  when a decision is taken to spend money in one particular area, it means that  there is no money for another area? Furthermore, does the Member accept that  agreeing to establish an additional Irish-language school, when there are over  100 vacant places in a school less than a mile away, is a decision that will  use scarce additional resources, and, therefore, one that limits choices in  other areas of expenditure? Finally, does the Member accept that that was a bad  decision, particularly as it went against the advice of officials?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The Minister of Education has clarified exactly what advice was given to her by  officials and by other bodies in the Department of Education. The issue is not  about denying one person&rsquo;s rights in favour of another&rsquo;s; it is about ensuring  that we deliver services to the entire community, including to those parents  who want their children to be educated in the Irish-medium sector.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Members opposite are right: Members should not come  into the Chamber and cry for more money. Ministers have to run the Departments  and the services at their disposal as efficiently as possible.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Members across the Chamber, who are currently blocking a  Bill that would provide for the establishment of an education and skills  authority, and who are protecting the five education and library boards, will  be interested to know that of the &pound;100 million that Mr Hamilton said the  Department of Education handed back, &pound;27 million was handed back by the five  education and library boards.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Is the Member aware that &pound;3&middot;8 million of the children and young people&rsquo;s fund  to assist voluntary- and community-sector projects working with children in  disadvantaged areas was handed back by the Department of Education to the  centre? I quote a letter from the OFMDFM liaison officer to the Education  Committee:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Department of Education managed the funding  package and the &pound;3&middot;8 million relates to money which that Department identified  as not being required. It was therefore declared as a reduced requirement from  the Centre.</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">As already stated, this funding package was managed by  DE and the &pound;3&middot;8 million identified was not brought to this Department&rsquo;s  attention. Junior Ministers are writing to the Department of Education to  ascertain if this reduced requirement was reported to the Education Committee&rdquo;.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  One other lesson that I have learned in political life is to never ask a  question unless you know the answer. If Mr Bradley had stayed at the Education  Committee meeting on Friday, he would know the answer to that question.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I was present for the whole meeting.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  In that case, you must not have been listening.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Education managed the fund. However, the  Departments responsible for handing back that money &mdash; and it may come as a  shock and an inconvenience to Mr Bradley &mdash; were the Department of Health and  the Department for Social Development. Mr Bradley wants to criticise a Minister  for handing back that money &mdash; I am sure that Ms Ritchie will be in her seat at  some point. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span><span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member should check the minutes of the Committee for  Education. As I said, the Department for Social Development and the Department  of Health were responsible for handing back that money.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned that &pound;27 million was handed back from the  education and library boards. Had the boards not contributed &pound;20 million to the  classroom assistants&rsquo; dispute, they would have handed back &pound;47 million this  financial year, which the parties across the Chamber are defending. That is a  layer of bureaucracy and administration that is soaking up funds that could go  to the extended schools and other facilities.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">During Question Time, the Minister of Culture, Arts and  Leisure talked about how Departments have to take different decisions on  various issues. Mr Hamilton was right: &pound;50 million was handed back from the  capital build fund, including &pound;21 million from one project. That was because  land that the Department of Education was getting from the Department for  Social Development was found to be contaminated, which resulted in a delay in  the land being handed over. That was no one&rsquo;s fault.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">When Members banter figures back and forth across the  Chamber, they should be aware of the facts behind those figures. Until we grasp  the nettle of taking decisions about the economy and have debates about how we  run the economy &mdash; instead of today&rsquo;s debate, which has been a finger-pointing  exercise about who is to blame for what, and so on &mdash; we will continue with the  same rigmarole year in, year out. Let us take bold decisions in the future, and  let us, as locally elected politicians with collective responsibility, start  taking control of our destiny.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Earlier in the debate, Declan O&rsquo;Loan, when leading off for the SDLP, made a  true comment. He said that, because this was one of a number of debates on the  budgetary process, there was a danger that we would hear a good deal of  repetition in Members&rsquo; remarks. Unfortunately, that is what has happened.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I pledge that I will try to avoid saying anything novel in  my remarks that will add to the sum total of human understanding. The only  reasonably novel remarks have been made by Back-Benchers, who are in  competition to express their humility. The Member who is due to speak after me  is Mr Basil McCrea &mdash; that, at least, will be an occasion on which the humility  will end.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  will, humbly, give way.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The Member has not yet said that he is humble. If he wants to say that, I will  concur.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  am more than happy to declare my level of humility in this process. As I  indicated, the humility of my contribution will become abundantly clear over  the next few minutes.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">When one examines the budgetary process, two issues are  uppermost in people&rsquo;s minds. One was the reason why a number of us were at the  gates of Stormont with various representatives from the trade unions today. The  first of those two issues is a fear or concern to ensure that front-line  services are fully protected in any budgetary process.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, there is a challenge on the Assembly as a whole  and, in particular, the Executive, to ensure that we do things differently.  Stephen Farry made reference to that. On that second point, if we do exactly  the same as a direct rule Minister, but with a Northern Ireland accent, people  will say that the Assembly is some form of expensive white elephant. We must  achieve things in a different fashion.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We have a Budget that is capable of ensuring that  front-line services are protected. Continual reference has been made to the 3%  efficiency savings; let us remember that the purpose of that is to redirect  money to ensure that there is a shift from bureaucracy to front-line services.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There is no desire to make people wear a hair shirt, but  there is a desire to recycle money to ensure on-the-ground delivery. There is  genuine concern that when Departments are asked to make that level of  efficiency savings, they do not look at slaughtering some of their sacred cows,  and do not look at ways in which they can change bureaucracy and programmes,  but that they instead look for easy targets. It is important that the Finance  Committee and the Public Accounts Committee ensure that Departments be  scrutinised at that level to ensure that they deliver up front.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is disappointing that the Health Department has handed  back more than &pound;50 million &mdash; to which reference has been made, and with good  reason &mdash; at a time when we are being told about great shortages in that Department  and others.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I take on board what Peter Robinson, the then Finance  Minister, said last week. He stated that it is better to have no spend than bad  spend. It is not simply a question of ensuring that the books balance at the  end of the year. There is a challenge for Departments in respect of their  spending &mdash; be it on large capital programmes or recurrent expenditure &mdash; to  ensure that we do not reach a situation whereby money is not delivered to  front-line services.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, Departments have to apply a degree of prioritisation  and structuring. Declan O&rsquo;Loan mentioned the Health Service, and said that some  units perform better than others, which is undoubtedly the case. There is a  need for structural change; there is a need to ensure that best practice exists.  In reality, it is about ensuring that Departments are fit for purpose &mdash; that  they can fully deliver on their promises, and genuinely fund front-line  services.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Member has been critical of the fact that the Department of Health returned  &pound;50 million. Is the Member pleased that a major part of that was as a result of  more efficient purchasing in the pharmaceutical section by buying products at a  more efficient level? Is it not good that &pound;20 million was saved, and that that  money has come back to the Northern Ireland Budget, which can be spent in  subsequent years?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Any  efficiency savings are good. However, it was identified that &pound;20 million was  saved at the end of the year. Why was it not identified earlier in the cycle?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  For goodness&rsquo; sake.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Well, that meant that money that could have been brought into the delivery of  front-line services had to be held back. That occurred in the Health Department  when pressure is on to provide a better Health Service.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am not blaming the present Health Minister for that  situation &mdash; that has been happening in the Health Service for quite a time. The  Health Service has received much more resources than in the past, but nobody  could argue that people who use the Health Service are more satisfied.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">What applies to the Health Department can also apply to  other Departments. It is about ensuring that Departments use their resources  properly and deliver better front-line services. From that point of view, it is  important to consider doing things differently. The Budget allowed things to be  done differently &mdash; the regional rate was frozen; action was taken on the  business rate; and changes were made regarding free public transport, which  will take effect in the autumn.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Those are areas in which value has been added for people in  Northern Ireland.  Our economy needs to be restructured &mdash; unless it is about creating wealth, it  will simply come down to how we slice up the cake.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Members can make valid points for services that need  funding, because often government is not a choice between a good area of spend  and a bad area of spend but between competing priorities that everyone agrees  are fundamentally good.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">If we are to increase the size of the cake, we must ensure  that the economy grows. The Executive proposals will help us to move slowly  towards a better-structured economy; one that creates conditions that could  lead to the growth of the private sector rather than the decimation of the  public sector.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Our actions need to be more imaginative. With respect to  some Members, actions that have proved unsuccessful in the past cannot be used  again. For example, in the first Assembly, we had ring-fenced Executive funds.  They were meant to create much more cross-cutting thinking &mdash; in practice, it  meant that Departments that had bids rejected simply made recycled bids that  were jazzed up to look as if they could be connected with another Department,  but it did not lead to different thinking.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Different thinking is needed. Sammy Wilson pointed out that  expenditure for schools here is among the lowest in the United Kingdom.  If schools had greater freedom to spend their own budgets rather than money  being held by either the Department or the education and library boards, school  principals could focus and deliver on the important issues.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">That is a much better way in which to operate than the  contradictory position of the Alliance Party, which seems to argue that more  integrated schools should be built because there is too much capacity in the  system. I see that Mr Ford is shaking his head &mdash; he could perhaps counter by  saying that some schools should close to accommodate those new integrated  schools. If there is oversupply in the system, building additional schools in a  new sector is the last thing that should be done. I am more than happy to give  way if the Member has a list of schools that he wishes to see closed to make  way for his new schools. However, I suspect that the silence from those Benches  will be deafening.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  will not take time away from the Member&rsquo;s speech &mdash; I intend to address that  issue when I get my turn.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thought that the Member said when he gets his &ldquo;term.&rdquo; I thought that the  Alliance Party envisaged such success that it will choose the Department of  Education in the next mandate.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We have good Supply Estimates that could help to address  the fundamental issues that face Northern Ireland.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I address the Assembly with complete humility, humble as I am, and following  the learned words of others who have spoken before me. There is another word to  go along with &ldquo;humble&rdquo;, and that word is &ldquo;humanity&rdquo;. What we must address is  the purpose of the Assembly and the Budget, and I hope to address both with a  certain amount of honesty.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It appears to me that there is an issue about our education  system. The system cannot be changed in the timescale envisaged or without  spending considerably more resources than we have heretofore given to it. It  seems strange that the extended schools programme, which has the support of all  Members, should be cut drastically. One would have thought that someone,  somewhere, would have found the &pound;5 million that is needed to keep that  programme going.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to Mr O&rsquo;Dowd having words with Mr Dominic Bradley  about who was responsible and who was at fault. Surely, what really matters is  that those schools will lose their funding and that someone must take  responsibility. Members may start pointing their fingers, but the  responsibility falls within the remit of the Minister of Education.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am about to say something important on this matter, and I  am happy for Mr Maskey to intervene. Here and now, Members can take it that the  two Ulster Unionist Ministers will be placing the extended schools programme  funding at the top of their priorities. That is unequivocal. It is absolutely  necessary to get the funding issue addressed.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Members know that funding in the monitoring rounds will be  tight.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Does that mean that the two Ministers in question will go to the Minister of  Finance and Personnel or the Minister of Education and offer some of the  projects that they have already prioritised and that are in the spending queue  to replace some of the deficiencies that may appear in the budget of the  Department of Education? That is the only way in which the funding can be  achieved. If that is not the case, it is only rhetoric, although it may be  well-intended rhetoric. Unless someone offers money from another project, the  Member&rsquo;s words mean nothing.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Honi soit qui mal y pense, which means, &ldquo;shame be to him who thinks evil of  it&rdquo;. When one stands up and makes a genuine commitment to address an issue and  make a difference &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> &mdash; one gets such a  response.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  I asked you a question. Can you not answer it?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Please address remarks through the Chair.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am prepared to make a commitment, but Members opposite are so keen to get up  and chitter that they do not listen. That is what is wrong with this place:  there is too much talking at people and not enough talking to people. If  Members want the issue dealt with, the Executive should get together and work  out their priorities. The Executive should admit that it is shameful to talk  about taking funding away from extended schools in some of the most socially  deprived areas. They should have some form of conscience and be able to sit  down and decide how to provide the funding. Every Minister should look to see  how the money can be found. The Ulster Unionist Ministers will give a  commitment to work with colleagues to address the issue. Is that clear enough  for you? We will all have a look at the issue.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  It is ridiculous for Basil McCrea to say that. I said that he may mean well &mdash;  and I am not second-guessing or questioning his integrity in the matter.  However, he should not dare to lecture any other Member about having a  conscience about the Budget. His Ministers are on the Executive: they have sat  down with the other Ministers on the Executive; they have deliberated on the  Budget; and they have agreed the Budget. The Member should not try to lecture  the rest of us.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am simply saying that, rather than a Member stating that  he speaks on behalf of his party&rsquo;s two Ministers, those Ministers should make a  firm commitment at the next meeting of the Executive. The Member cannot,  whether he likes it or not, make a commitment on their behalf. I imagine that  the two Ministers concerned have many projects in their respective queues of  priorities and that they are committed to delivering those on behalf of the  people whom they represent.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is, therefore, ridiculous that the Assembly must listen  to Basil McCrea speaking from his high horse. All Members have a conscience and  know what they are in the Assembly to deliver; that may be based on the  individual party manifestos or the collective responsibility that the Executive  established in the Programme for Government. I do not like listening to someone  with that high-horse mentality, and I am not prepared to do so.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Sometimes, even I regret allowing Members to intervene &mdash; and look at how much  time has been taken up. The Member had a chance to make a speech. He should vow  to persuade his party&rsquo;s Minister of Education to honour her commitments to the people  of Northern Ireland.  The funding of the extended schools programme is the issue, and the Ulster  Unionist Party will match any amount that the Member can produce. When the  Ulster Unionists came forward with money, the Sinn F&eacute;in Minister could not provide  match funding. The Member has repeatedly tried to turn the debate into an  argument, but I am standing here to say that the Ulster Unionist Party realised  that there is a problem and is now trying to provide assistance.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I will not be told on what subjects I may or  may not address the House, and the Member will not lecture me on this issue as  he has on others previously. This is a discussion; this is the time for Members  to introduce ideas. Early learning and primary schools are foremost amongst the  areas that the Assembly must address.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is absolutely ridiculous that, in Northern Ireland, primary schools receive only  62% of the funding received by secondary schools and 10% or 20% less than  primary schools in England  and Wales.  The Assembly must find a way to match that level of funding. If it does not,  primary school leaders, who are at the forefront of the trial of the extended  schools programme, will have to take time off work due to illness, and,  ultimately, they will be unable to do their jobs. If the Assembly were a  private company, it would be legally responsible for that eventuality, because  Members know that there is stress in the system, and they are not doing  anything about it. The Assembly is forcing school leaders to struggle on without  addressing the issues that affect them.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The debate on the Budget must extend beyond academic  selection or academic criteria to how to move this place forward. If the  Assembly is to address the legacy of the past and prepare young people for the  future, it must invest more in schools. There was a discussion on whether the  economy is at the centre of the Assembly&rsquo;s agenda. The economy is only part of  the agenda. Education, education, education &mdash; that is the only way out of the  poverty trap, and a good education is the only sustainable advantage that  people can gain.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">This body politic must find a way to deal properly with  education, because it requires significant investment. I talk about making  various changes, and I can suggest where the money should be spent: for  example, the Assembly must develop an effective strategy for 14- to  19-year-olds, increase nursery provision and find a way to ensure that the  extended schools programme is available not only to those schools that have  been identified but to all schools.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I have a direct question to ask in the Chamber today: will  the Minister of Education allow primary schools to carry forward their reserves  to keep the programme going for another year, or will the Department of  Education insist on drawing them back into the centre?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">When it comes to how to make progress, I do not agree with  the idea that the declining demographic should necessarily mean a decrease in  funding. The Assembly should take the opportunity that it provides to invest in  schools and children and try to achieve better pupil:teacher ratios, because  that is the one measure that continues to make a difference.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">If the Assembly does not invest in early-years provision,  it will have to begin to invest more in prisons, social welfare, health services,  and so forth. Education requires a long-term commitment that cannot be met  through incrementalism. There must be a fundamental review on education and  education policy. If such a review were introduced honestly to the Executive,  the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s Ministers will respond in kind.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  On 29 January 2008, the SDLP voted against the Budget, and neither my party nor  I regrets having done so, because there are fundamental problems with it.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The concerns that our party raised &mdash; rightly &mdash; at that time  have been brought into stark relief today, even though a few months have  passed. It is important that we focus on those concerns again.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I will make one general point before I discuss those concerns  in detail. The economy in the UK  and throughout western Europe has experienced a fundamental crisis in credit,  financial stability, the property market, land values, and so forth. A great  deal of the Budget was predicated on the fact that assets could be sold off in order  to derive capital with which to finance the Budget and its programmes. During  the debate that I mentioned, our party said that that was a precarious  foundation on which to base any Budget. We have been proven correct.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Beggs, in his earlier address, referred to the decrease  in the value of lands at Crossnacreevy. He told the House that there had been a  massive devaluation of that land. If that were the case, he asked, how would we  finance the nutrient scheme that the farmers need? That is a fundamental  question that needs to be answered, not just in relation to Crossnacreevy, but  to other schemes.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to remember that, prior to the Budget&rsquo;s  being settled, when we were discussing the vexed issue of social housing, our  party was told that we were crying wolf about the financing of social housing  and that there was sufficient money in the Budget. However, we remained firm,  and together with the Minister for Social Development, we demanded additional  funding for housing. We got &pound;205 million extra. That was important, because we  now see the value of having that money as opposed to looking for funds from the  realisation of assets.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Therein lies a lesson: we should not predicate a Budget on  the basis of future capital realisation. That situation has thrown the  Department of Finance and Personnel into a great deal of confusion as to where  the money will come from. I think that if one plots the next financial year,  there will be some very nasty surprises as it develops. Unfortunately, I do not  believe that the British Exchequer will bail us out, particularly given that we  are sending &pound;170 million of unspent money back to it. That sends the very sorry  message to the British Exchequer that either we do not need the money or we are  incapable of spending it when we get it on a plate. Sending so much money back  illustrates that there is a fundamental flaw somewhere.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There is a very fine primary school in my constituency that  has 300 pupils, 75 of whom are on the special needs register. At present, their  educational needs are met by two full-time special educational needs teachers &mdash;  one of whom provides a specific reading programme entitled Reading Recovery &mdash;  and an outreach-support teacher.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The school chooses which children need support using  standardised scores in reading and maths. A score of 100 is considered average.  Children whose scores are below 85 are chosen for support. Children who score  between 85 and 95 are supported through the Rainbow Reading programme, which is  funded through extended schools. Parents of all children are offered support  through the parents&rsquo; support programme, which is also funded through extended  schools.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, because of the reduction in the extended  schools programme, the school cannot afford to provide full-time special  educational needs support, the Reading Recovery programme, the Rainbow Reading  programme, the breakfast club or the parents&rsquo; support programme during the  school year 2008-09.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The school&rsquo;s budget has been further reduced through  targeting social need. Up to 75% of children used to be entitled to free school  meals. With the introduction of family tax credit, that has been reduced to  55%, because parents who avail themselves of the scheme cannot apply for free  school meals. Often, those parents have low-paid jobs. When their family tax  credits are balanced with the loss of benefits such as free school meals, they  are no better off financially. That means that the school must continue to deal  with the same social and academic problems, but with a much reduced budget.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Department of Finance and the Department of  Education what hope there is for those 75 children who will be deprived of  special educational needs support during the next academic year. Is that the  way that a primary-education system should operate in an area of severe  deprivation? I appeal to those Departments to remedy that situation because it  is replicated across Belfast  and across the country.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There are serious problems with the Budget. The Assembly  has only scratched the surface of those problems; the next year could be  disastrous. Those problems require a united effort from the two parties that  dominate the Executive, and they must work together to resolve them. The Assembly  can only tell them what is wrong; it cannot force their hands. It can, however,  bring public opinion to bear in order to pressurise those parties to get their  act together. There is no point in their acting in the usual disparate fashion.  A united effort is needed at the centre, particularly in the Department of  Finance, to tackle all those problems that other Members and I have outlined in  the debate. It is vital for society&rsquo;s future that that be done.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Today, the trades union movement demonstrated outside the  House in order to emphasise its grave concerns about the Budget; not least  about efficiency savings, but about threatened job losses among its members,  particularly in public services. It is important that the Executive take that  on board.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the motions. One Member mentioned the Irish language Act; given that  that would cost &pound;290 million, there is no economic sense for it. That figure is  equivalent to the budget for the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure for  almost three years. The DUP will not sign up to an Irish language Utopia &mdash; not  now, not ever.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I shall focus on how tourism relates to the motion, and I  shall make a few comments that, I hope, will be helpful and specific. The  Lonely Planet tour guide described Northern Ireland as:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;abuzz with life: the cities are pulsating, the  economy is thriving and the people, the lifeblood that courses through the  country, are in good spirits&rdquo;.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Furthermore, in another part of the guide, Belfast is mentioned as  one of the top ten cities on the rise. That should kick-start a genuine tourism  push which, not unlike the Discover Scotland adverts that were so attractive on  TV and in cinemas here, should feed directly to TVs in GB, in the Republic and  further afield.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We have the impetus behind us of being in a new dawn with  no threat of violence or fear for safety, and that must be exploited. Alongside  that, the views of our natural beauty and history, coupled with the vivacity  that is linked with anything that originates in Northern Ireland, cannot help but  draw others to our shores. For that reason, funding must be set aside to  enhance tourism potential, including finance to enable better facilities.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In reply to a question that I asked last week, the Minister  Nigel Dodds said that the numbers of cruise liners that will come to Northern  Ireland this year will increase from 27 to 36, and that the number of visitors  will increase from 41,000 to 54,000 from the cruise liners alone. A great many  of those people will visit the abbey in Greyabbey in the Ards Peninsula;  I understand that some 10,000 visitors are expected this year.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that the returns from dedicated funding  for a concerted international TV advertisement, similar to the adverts for  Florida that currently grace our screens, would well outmatch the outlay. Northern Ireland  as a whole would be the winner.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland has it all, including rest and  recuperation in superior salons and five-star hotels; nature holidays; touring  the country and staying in quaint bed and breakfast accommodation; touring in  caravans, using our many caravan parks; and shopping in the city, followed by  dinner and a show. Therefore, a sincere and earnest push must be made to show  that to the rest of the world.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  It is interesting to listen to the Member run through all the positive aspects  of the North; however, the serious social deprivation that exists in many areas  must also be taken into consideration. In many ways, that is often forgotten.  One of the main strategies for dealing with social deprivation is neighbour&shy;hood  renewal, yet that seems set to be transferred out of the control of DSD and  into the control of local government at a time when central Government should  be funding it to such an extent that social deprivation can be seriously dealt  with.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Member agree that 100,000 people who are on  incapacity benefit are classed as being economically inactive, and are  therefore not included in the unemploy&shy;ment figures? If those people were  included in the figures, unemployment would be far higher than is reflected in  the current figures.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I concur with those comments, and, based on my experience from my advice  centre, I echo the Member&rsquo;s points on incapacity benefit, disability living  allowance (DLA) and deprivation.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Wha&rsquo; cud richtly bae cried the hidden Jewel i Ulster&rsquo;s  Croon &ndash; Strangford bes an unbeknownst gem i global terms an&rsquo; yet hit bes  undootedly true at the breath taakin view fae Scrabo Tower i Newtonards wi.

	        <p class="B3BodyText">Strangford could fairly be called the hidden jewel in the  Province&rsquo;s crown, but, globally, it is an unknown gem. The breathtaking view in  every direction from Scrabo Tower in Newtownards &mdash; towards the Mournes, over the  sea to Scotland and towards Belfast city &mdash; cannot be  equalled. Newtownards has a superior hotel, nightlife, a weekly market,  cinemas, a great shopping complex and beauty salons aplenty. Driving down the  peninsula, one finds beauty and wildlife aplenty, with many coffee and tea  shops, antique shops and superior places in which to eat.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">History and culture is rich throughout the Ards Peninsula,  including the well-known Scrabo Tower and Mount   Stewart house and  gardens. Portavogie is our only example of a working fishing village, and that  is combined with the beauty of the landscape, caravan parks and B&amp;B  accommodation.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Exploris in Portaferry already attracts more than 200,000  visitors a year, and has the capacity to attract many more. If one takes the  ferry from Portaferry to Strangford village, the journey time of eight minutes  cuts out more than an hour and a half of driving and covers the route taken by  Princess Alexandra in 2003 as part of a theme day to recognise excellence in  tourism throughout the UK.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">For more modern cultural tourists, the Ards Peninsula  provides the Battletown gallery, which is gaining an international reputation,  and, if one wants not only the opportunity to purchase but to make superior  pottery, one can visit the Eden Pottery Centre.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">On the other side of the Ards Peninsula,  near Comber, one comes upon Castle Espie Wildfowl and Wetland Centre, as well  as restaurants and archaeological and historical links to the monastic life of  Saint Patrick. County   Down&rsquo;s history covers  7,000 years, and no history buff could help but be enthralled by such evident  preservation in the area of days gone by.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Even with all those attractions in a single place, it is  clear that people in the rest of Northern Ireland &mdash; never mind those  in the wider world &mdash; are generally unaware of them. The only people who are  fully aware of what Strangford has to offer are those who are blessed enough to  have been born there or who have passed through the area.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The two-day Northern Ireland Game Fair at Ballywalter Park  attracted a record number of country-sports enthusiasts to Strangford &mdash; more  than 25,000. That is another field in which the area has the potential to  excel. A group of American country-sports enthusiasts &mdash; along with their lovely  wives &mdash; took a five-day trip, spending &pound;50,000. Country sports already employ 3,000  people and generate &pound;45 million for the Province&rsquo;s economy, and, if  Strangford&rsquo;s successes could be repeated in the rest of the Province, there is  great potential for more business.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The bottom line is that, given the opportunity, Strangford  &mdash; and Northern Ireland  &mdash; has the potential to boost tourism and for it to become a major factor in our  economy. Funding must be allocated for widespread promotion and, as a place of  outstanding beauty, culture, diversity and modern facilities, Strangford must  be given the recognition that it is due. Such an all-encompassing mix of  qualities should be promoted.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Although no other constituency offers quite the same  potential as Strangford, all constituencies &mdash; and the Province as a whole &mdash;  should be able to display themselves and create a showcase for the world. In  order to do that, funding must be set aside, and I urge the Minister to ensure  that that is done and that people from County Tyrone to County Antrim &mdash; from Eskra  to Ballywalter &mdash; benefit from the financial boost that will come when the world  realises what a gem we have in Strangford and, indeed, in Northern Ireland. I  support the motions.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  will attempt to look slightly wider than my constituency. I had hoped to  congratulate the humble Back-Bencher from Strangford, Mr Simon Hamilton, on his  promotion to the Front Bench, but, unfortunately, he managed to escape before I  was able to speak. I was wondering whether, by the time this debate was over,  Mrs Foster, Mr Donaldson or Mr Hamilton would be responding on behalf of the  Executive.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I will take up where my colleague Dr Farry left off,  specifically concerning some aspects of health and social services expenditure.  Clearly, there is a major funding gap in relation to mental-health services. In  Northern Ireland,  approximately 8% of the health and social care budget is spent on mental  health, whereas, in other regions of the United Kingdom, spending averages  12%. That is a huge shortfall.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Every party in the Chamber refers to the Bamford Report and  to the need to ensure that services are adequately funded for people with  mental illnesses. Nevertheless, we have a huge gap in services, and we are  simply failing to meet the needs of those citizens.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">At different times, that can be a substantial part of our  population. Indeed, I was told recently by a psychiatrist that of those who are  currently economically inactive &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.] </span>He gave  his opinion entirely professionally, although I did not see him in a patient  capacity. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">That may be considered a good joke, but the fact that 40%  of our economically inactive fellow citizens suffer from a mental illness is an  indication of what we are losing economically, as well as socially, by failing  to invest in mental-health services.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">That loss has a knock-on effect on our overall economy.  Consider the number of people who suffer from different stages of mental  illness: those people have a wide range of talents and could do all kinds of  jobs. They could contribute to society, but we are all losing out on that  because we do not provide the mental-health services that enable them to take  up employment. That is a clear example of how investment in mental health would  pay economic dividends. It is also a clear example of a failure to practise  joined-up government. Individual departmental budgets are being considered  without account being taken either of the knock-on effect on other areas or of  the significant opportunity costs that arise as a result of our failure to  address the needs of those who are mentally ill. Let us ask the Executive to  take such matters into account when they consider future budgeting. In future,  will we hear a DETI or a DEL Minister pointing out the need for money to be  invested in mental health if we are to prosper as a society generally?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">An issue that is often related to people&rsquo;s mental health is  learning disability &mdash; although it is, of course, a different matter. It was  mentioned alongside mental-health issues in the Bamford Review, and it is  similarly underfunded. It might be that many of those who suffer from a  learning disability would not make a significant contribution to the economy,  but there are undoubtedly those who could. More particularly, if social-care  services were better organised to cater for those who suffer from a learning  disability, many carers could make a contribution to the economy. In some  cases, many patients have been removed from some of the bigger institutions,  such as Muckamore   Abbey Hospital  in my constituency, yet we have failed to ensure that the costs of community  care &mdash; which, in many cases, are greater than the costs of caring for people in  large institutions &mdash; are met properly. As a result, some people do not receive  all that they ought to in the community, and they &mdash; and their families and  carers &mdash; continue to suffer because of that failure to invest properly. Again,  that lack of investment has a knock-on effect on society.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">No doubt the Minister who is currently acting on behalf of  the Department of Finance and Personnel would be upset if I did not mention  environmental matters. What has happened in the past couple of months, since  the Budget was finalised, has shown the total inadequacy of the transportation  funding in DRD&rsquo;s budget.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Belfast continues to be the  only city of its size in Europe that seems to  imagine that it can deal with a commuting problem by building more roads. Yet,  as Stephen Farry pointed out, 80% of the Department for Regional Development&rsquo;s  budget is tilted towards roads and only 20% towards public transport.  Certainly, more investment in trains and buses was announced in that budget.  The simple reality is that, as far as heavy rail is concerned, half the trains  in the current investment package are required to replace redundant stock,  principally on the Larne line. Only half the trains will be available to  improve the quality of existing services in any way. Moreover, there are  continuing problems with the Enterprise  service, with the rolling stock now at the point where it is failing to meet  the needs of those who wish to travel between the two major cities on this  island. A great deal more investment is needed in that service.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">DRD tends to make small, piecemeal efforts to provide what  it terms &ldquo;park-and-ride&rdquo; facilities. It is open to question whether providing a  few dozen parking spaces on the Ballyhenry Road, which is a couple of hundred  metres from the Sandyknowes roundabout, will encourage anybody to drive through  Sandyknowes to make use of them. The Transport Holding Company has invested in  land for potential park-and-ride facilities, but further investment has not  been forthcoming to enable that land to be used for that purpose. That is a  fairly crass example of a lack of joined-up government &mdash; short-term budgetary  considerations mean that the land has been purchased but is not being put to  the use for which it has been designed.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We need to ensure that all those aspects of transport  policy show that government is not just joined up but is sustainable. When we  see the way that oil prices are rising, continuing to depend on the current  level of private car transport is simply unsustainable. Yet we have seen no  sign that that aspect of the Budget is being reversed.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The cost of fuel has knock-on effects in areas such as the  warm homes scheme, and a wider knock-on effect on social housing. Although  there has been some additional investment in those areas, there is a vast  amount that still needs to be done if we are to provide decent living  conditions for many of our people.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I put again to the Minister the question that Stephen Farry  posed as I briefly touch on the environment agency that she is proposing: what  is the opportunity cost of not having an independent environmental protection  agencycompared to the relatively miniscule cost of establishing and running one?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the fact that neither Sammy Wilson nor Peter Weir  is in the Chamber, I want to refer to the schools estate, which was discussed  earlier, and about which my party received criticism. The Alliance Party fully  supports the concept of integrated education being available for those who wish  it for their children. There are some cases when that might involve building a  new school. The post-primary situation in north Down, for example, where there  is a shortage of places, is a clear indication that expansion is needed in that  area.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The reality for most cases, however, is that the option to  move towards integrated education is an option for transformation, which is  becoming increasingly popular and which is the option that my party has said  makes sense with regard to public expenditure. To suggest that we have talked  only about new-build grant-maintained integrated schools is simply not factual.  In that respect, I declare an interest as a governor of Round Tower Integrated  Primary School in Antrim, which is an excellent example of a good school that  has transformed, which is making full use of the capital that has been invested  in its building, and which has an increasing demand for places. That is a good  example of how good relations work done by an existing school has resulted in a  logical transformation.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Declining school rolls in almost every area of the Province  will result in more of what Stephen Farry talked about earlier: the idea of two  primary schools in a village finding a way to work together &mdash; which might be an  amalgamation but might also be something short of that &mdash; as the way to ensure  the best use of available money. There ought to be a greater incentive from the  Department of Education to encourage similar ways for schools to come together.  The Alliance Party has made it clear that the public purse needs to see that  different type of creativity in what is planned for education.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I was asked earlier by Mr Weir which schools the Alliance  Party would propose for closure. The reality is that in his own constituency,  when Groomsport Primary School, a couple of years after transformation to  integrated status, still had a remarkably low roll and was proposed for closure  by the South Eastern Education and Library Board, it was Alliance Party members  who said that that was the only realistic way of saving on the public purse. It  was DUP members who demanded that a school with approximately 30 pupils was  kept open. Therefore, I am not sure that the lectures that were delivered  across the Chamber earlier are necessarily entirely right.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The issue has to be: what is the best rational use of the  school estate, and not knee jerks. As Stephen Farry made clear earlier, the Alliance Party does not  support this Supply resolution. However, having divided the House on the Budget  earlier this year, we shall not be dividing the House this afternoon.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  That children should be placed at the centre of society as fully respected and  supported members is increasingly upheld nationally and internationally from  the perspective of rights and best practice. Flowing from that, the desire to  ensure that all children experience better outcomes in their lives is a  compelling and influential force.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It demands that organisations examine how they can work  together to answer a fundamental question, namely: what do we want for our  children? They then need to chart a process in order to achieve those outcomes.  Therefore, it is dismaying to find that there is no protected funding for  children and young people in the Programme for Government or the Budget. The  play and leisure policy that is in draft form is now considering the age range  of 0 to 18 years rather than pre-school years as was first envisaged.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is also sad to note that no funding has been set aside  for any projects this year, and, over the next two years, a little over &pound;2  million has been set aside for play and leisure. Yet everyone knows the value  and importance of play in developing the abilities of children and young  people, particularly in their formative years, and its role in contributing to  the development of well-rounded individuals.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">This morning, I listened to an interview with some young  people who were facing their exams. They said that the exam stress in their  latter years of primary school through to university is intolerable. One young  man felt that stress was leading to harmful behaviour and to the culture of  young people taking their own lives. Therefore it is not acceptable that no  money has been allocated in the Programme for Government for flagship projects  or for children and young people.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Some groups that were previously funded by the Executive  programme children&rsquo;s fund or by the extended schools programme have folded.  There is a great deal of uncertainty about what we are doing for our children.  Although play has an important role in children&rsquo;s development, affordable  childcare also has a role to play in developing a strong, vibrant economy,  which is the Government&rsquo;s main objective, yet many Ministers seem to fail to  recognise its value and necessity. For a strong economy to emerge, we must  invest at the softer end, that is, in the provision of children&rsquo;s and young  people&rsquo;s activities. We must support social-economy businesses, among others,  to provide affordable childcare.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Childcare funding should be ring-fenced. There are  arguments for and against mainstreaming and ring-fencing funding, but such  funding for children and young people would have sent a clear signal that we have  inclusive plans for children and young people that will lead to better  outcomes, not only for individuals but for society as a whole.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Children and young people are among the most marginalised  in society: so too are the homeless and those on housing waiting lists.  However, at least they can be thankful that the Minister for Social Development,  Margaret Ritchie, negotiated a substantial &pound;205 million increase above what was  offered in the draft Budget. Last year, she secured an extra &pound;50 million, which  allowed an extra 1,000 houses to be started over and above the original  projected out-turn for that year. However, there are major pressures on DSD&rsquo;s  budget. Some &pound;80 million of the budget is predicated on house and land sale  receipts, but, as many Members said, there are concerns about the decrease in  land values and about Housing Executive house sales drying up. That figure now  looks unrealistic. Fortunately, however, Margaret Ritchie secured agreement  from the Finance Minister that help would be available if events beyond her  control were to threaten the attainment of her new social and affordable house  building targets. The Minister of Finance and Personnel must live up to that  commitment.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister for Social Development has limited resources  available for a scheme designed to help people who are struggling to stay on  the housing ladder. A mortgage rescue scheme is an essential part of Minister  Ritchie&rsquo;s new housing agenda, and it deserves more support from the Finance  Minister if it is to help people through a very difficult time.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister for Social Development has continued her  Department&rsquo;s record high spending on the warm homes scheme, which is the  Executive&rsquo;s main response to fuel poverty. However, she has said that although  the record &pound;35 million spend on warm homes will help to improve energy  efficiency and keep many families out of fuel poverty, it is not sufficient to  respond to the crisis facing many people this coming winter.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Recent fuel price hikes, and other steep increases in the  price of food and other essentials, have resulted in a fuel-poverty crisis.  Although DETI has some respons&shy;ibility for energy policy and price regulation,  and Westminster  is responsible for the winter fuel payment, Margaret Ritchie has demonstrated  leadership and established a task force, comprising relevant Departments and  agencies, to co-ordinate efforts to combat fuel poverty. She has already  written to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to request a  substantial increase in the winter fuel payment and a complete refocusing of  that benefit to ensure that it reaches not only pensioners but other low-income  households who will struggle this winter. Her efforts must now command the full  support of Executive colleagues, and more resources must flow from the Department  of Finance and Personnel.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP is reported to have a shopping list in its latest  tactical negotiations with Gordon Brown at Westminster &mdash; an increase in the winter fuel  payment must be placed at the top of that list. The voluntary and community  sector will undergo radical change in the period ahead as certain funding  streams from Europe and elsewhere start to run  out. The Executive must be satisfied that sufficient funding is in place to  support the sector during that period of transition. The Minister for Social  Development has, courageously, started to refocus the funding available for  neighbourhood renewal to ensure that limited funds have maximum impact on the  ground in tackling deprivation.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">For too long, much of that community funding has been  regarded as paid posts for community activists, rather than as targeted  spending on tackling deprivation. The Minister for Social Development is  prepared to make difficult decisions, and she deserves greater support from  other Ministers. Neighbourhood renewal is an Executive initiative, and all  relevant Ministers must be prepared to fund it. The Department of Finance and  Personnel must encourage other Departments to fund their fair share of the  programme, and, as has been highlighted in the Chamber today, tackling poverty  &mdash; and child poverty in particular &mdash; is an Executive priority. No poor children  live in well-to-do families. However, it is sad that no funds have been set  aside for children and young people in the Programme for Government and the Budget.  That is clearly wrong, and I urge the Executive to rethink.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I welcome the section of the motion on the superannuation scheme for health  workers and the amount of money set aside for that scheme. However, I want  clarification on how we reached that position, because, in the past, there were  miscalculations in relation to that superannuation scheme, and the public need  reassurances that similar errors will not resurface. Furthermore, I want an  assurance that the money allocated to the scheme will not impact on the  delivery of front-line services in that sector.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As has been highlighted in the Assembly on previous  occasions, many schemes involving children, such as early-years provision and  after-school clubs, are now at risk. Some of those schemes will cease at the  end of June 2008; I want an assurance that funding for the coming year will be  available to help those organisations retain key staff and reassure the  communities that they serve.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of water charges was raised earlier. From 1 April  2008, the business sector has been obliged to pay water charges. Those  businesses are already under pressure and now have the additional burden of  water bills arriving at their premises.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Some of those businesses had no prior warning about their  bills until they arrived in the post; certainly, none of them had had any prior  discussions with anyone in the Department for Regional Development or Northern  Ireland Water.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Even more worrying is the fact that, since 1 April 2008,  water bills have been delivered to clergymen in parish churches. Some of those  bills have been shockingly high. Contact that has been made with my  constituency office indicates that those bills average &pound;500. It is disgraceful  that parish churches should have to pay such water charges. As everyone  understands, in no way is water used to that extent in any of our parish  churches anywhere in Northern    Ireland. Indeed, rather than billing them  for water, we should follow example of the Scottish Parliament, which exempted  Churches and charitable organisations from water charges.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister provide the House with some clarification  on water bills that average &pound;500? Do those bills represent 50% of the charges  that will be billed in April 2009? The Minister for Regional Development, Conor  Murphy, has not given any clarification. If those bills represent 50% of the  total charge, which will rise to 100% in April 2009, can Church authorities  expect to receive water bills totalling about &pound;1,000?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: This has been a useful and wide-ranging debate. Many  points have been raised, and although some of them have not always been  pertinent to the Supply resolutions and the Budget (No. 2) Bill, which I will  introduce shortly, they touch on the wider Budget considerations that Members  feel are important to reflect on and discuss. With your latitude, Mr Deputy  Speaker, and given the spirit in which Members raised those points, I will do  my best to respond as fully as possible in the 45 minutes that have been  allocated to me.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mitchel McLaughlin, the Chairperson of the Committee for Finance  and Personnel, spoke about the Committee&rsquo;s role in the budgetary process. I  thank the Chairperson for the Committee&rsquo;s support for the motions, and I  welcome his views on the important role that Statutory Committees played during  the monitoring rounds. The outgoing Minister of Finance and Personnel  wholeheartedly agreed with those views. He said so repeatedly, and encouraged  his Executive colleagues to engage proactively with the Statutory Committees.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson also highlighted the helpful contribution  that the Committee made to the previous Budget process. I acknowledge that  contribution. Looking forward, DFP officials have initiated a review of the  Budget process to seek to improve future Budgets. It is hoped that that work  will be completed by the autumn. I am aware that the outgoing Minister of  Finance and Personnel specifically asked his officials to continue to work with  the Committee on that issue.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and  Personnel spoke about accelerated passage, and I acknowledge his concern about  the use of that process. Officials will certainly review procedures to determine  whether there is any possibility of processing Budget Bills without the need  for accelerated passage. However, at present, it is necessary to ensure that  public services do not run out of money. As I said in proposing the motion, if  we did not deal with that issue, Departments would run out of money in the  middle of the summer, when none of us is about the place. I know that Members  do not want that to happen.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Storey also mentioned that financial training is  available for staff in the different Departments and asked whether it would be  available for Members. In the last Supply debate, in February, the outgoing  Minister of Finance and Personnel offered to make his officials available to  provide training to Members at any time. Unfortunately, that kind offer has not  yet been taken up. I reiterate that DFP officials are willing to help in any  way that they can and to provide briefings. I encourage all Members who wish to  have a wider understanding of the issues &mdash; not just those who sit on the  Finance and Personnel Committee &mdash; to take up that kind offer.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Roy Beggs said that he wanted more information on issues  in the Estimates. I take his point. It reinforces the need for better  engagement between the Departments, which are best placed to give those  explanations, and their Committees. Hopefully that will happen, given that a  review is ongoing.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Beggs and Mr O&rsquo;Loan mentioned the downturn in the  property market. In that context, it is essential that all Departments take  every possible action to secure the planned level of capital receipts that was  set out in the agreed Budget, so that capital investment projects can be taken  forward as planned. Although there are pressures, particularly in the  residential market, I am confident that Departments &mdash; working with the support  of the capital realisation task force, which Members mentioned &mdash; will be able  to maximise the level of capital receipts.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Many comments have been made about Ministers not working in  silos, but working together as a whole Executive. There is a need to consider  the level of capital receipts in the broader financial context this year. That  issue will be addressed in the June monitoring round.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The value of land at Crossnacreevy was mentioned by several  Members. The valuation that was included in the Budget was based on the best  possible advice at that time. I am aware that the Minister of Agriculture  raised the issue with the outgoing Finance Minister, and the Executive will  wish to consider the best way forward. It will be a material issue in the  strategic stocktaking that is planned for later this year.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Funding for children and young people was mentioned by most  Members who spoke &mdash; in particular, Roy Beggs, Declan O&rsquo;Loan, Dominic Bradley,  Simon Hamilton, Basil McCrea, Alban Maginness and the final Member to speak, Mr  Gallagher. As part of the recent Budget process, central funds &mdash; including the  children and young people&rsquo;s funding package &mdash; were mainstreamed, as Members  know. That was to allow Departments the necessary flexibility to manage such  issues in the context of their overall positions. In response to Departments&rsquo;  concerns, significant additional allocations were made at the time of both the  draft and revised Budgets to ensure that all worthwhile projects could  continue.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I concur absolutely with Roy Beggs on the issue. Frankly,  as I know from my constituency, after-school clubs do not care whether the  money comes from OFMDFM, the Department of Health or the Department of  Education. They only wish to know whether they will be able to continue their  work. I declare an interest in the matter, because my children attend an  after-school club in Brookeborough, County   Fermanagh. It is an  excellent facility, and the children enjoy it very much. Therefore, I, and the  whole Executive, wish such clubs to continue.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">However, as Mr Storey said, the main problem is that  individual Ministers have decided not to continue funding certain projects and  have, instead, sought to lay the blame at the door of the Department of Finance  and Personnel. I dispute absolutely the suggestion that my party is to blame in  any way for the reduction in extended schools or after-school provision. The  Executive will continue to consider the amount of resources available to  individual public services, but the primary responsibility lies with individual  Departments to prioritise their resources.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea made the excellent point, in the debate on  extended schools, that the funding gap identified by the Minister of Education  was &pound;4 million, compared to a budget of over &pound;1&middot;7 billion &mdash; 0&middot;2% of the  available funds. That is a very telling statistic.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the debate on extended schools, Dominic Bradley  spoke about the bid for additional funding in this in-year monitoring round. It  would be wrong to pre-empt the Executive&rsquo;s consideration of June monitoring,  but all Departments face significant pressures. One such pressure is equal pay,  which the outgoing Minister of Finance and Personnel was keen to sort out. I  concur with his determination to deal with that under a devolved  Administration. The Education Minister&rsquo;s spending performance in 2007-08  suggests that she has plenty of capacity to deal with extended schools  provision. Mr Hamilton and several other Members made that point, and I endorse  their valid comments.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I, and the entire Executive, want to deal with that issue.  Every party expressed significant concern about extended schools and  after-school clubs. We need to get that sorted out very soon.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I concur with Dolores Kelly about the pressure on children  in schools. Those of us who sat the 11-plus, or indeed any exam, throughout our  school lives forgot about it once it was finished. That is no longer the case;  children are under incredible pressure in school. We must assess how much  pressure we put on our children and, indeed, what society demands of them.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mark Durkan and Dolores Kelly talked about the ring-fencing  of money in the children&rsquo;s fund. All the funding that was previously allocated  to ring-fenced areas has now been allocated to Departments. However &mdash; as Mrs  Kelly pointed out &mdash; that reallocation has not been ring-fenced. Each Minister  must prioritise funding in the context of all the issues that they face. In an  intervention during Mr Hamilton&rsquo;s speech, Mr Durkan suggested that the junior  Ministers should take up the issue. However, it is a departmental issue because  the Departments have been given the money.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Beggs mentioned efficiency savings versus cuts. Dr Farry  also commented that the public view efficiency savings merely as cuts.  Departments should achieve progress on savings delivery by improving efficiency  rather than simply by cutting services Departments should not cut frontline  services in an attempt to meet the 3% efficiency targets. Reductions in  services are often perceived as cuts when it is simply a scaling back of  provision to its appropriate level.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Sammy Wilson spoke at length about over-provision in the  schools estate. In particular, he talked about the development of the  integrated and Irish-medium sectors and the additional pressures of surplus  places. I thank Mr Ford for his intervention, which provided the House with  some clarity on integrated schools. A debate on the integrated education  matters that he discussed would provide the best way forward.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan and Dr Farry spoke about the Budget&rsquo;s  over-reliance on efficiency savings. It is right that public services are  delivered as efficiently as possible; therefore, the Executive have asked each  Minister to deliver annual efficiency savings of 3%. In its efficiency delivery  plan, each Department has published details of how those savings are to be  delivered. The Executive are clear that the focus is on efficiency rather than  on cuts or service reductions.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan and Mr Gallagher spoke about water and sewerage  services. Mr Gallagher mentioned, in particular, clarification on bills. As I  said in my introduction, I am sure that the Minister for Regional Development  will follow up this debate by providing clarification on such matters. As Mr  Gallagher and Mr O&rsquo;Loan know, the independent water review panel concluded that  the contribution from the regional rate is not sufficient to deliver water and  sewerage services in the long term.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive, during a meeting on 8 October 2007, agreed  unanimously to introduce additional revenue streams to pay for water and  sewerage services; that householders should provide a greater contribution; and  that charging would commence in April 2009.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive also agreed that no one should have to pay  twice for water, giving full recognition to householder contributions towards  water and sewerage services from the domestic regional rate. The Department for  Regional Development has submitted a paper to the Executive outlining the  proposed charging methodology, and the Minister is seeking the Executive&rsquo;s  agreement to those proposals: that is where the matter sits currently.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan and Dr Farry spoke about an independent  environmental protection agency, and undoubtedly Mr O&rsquo;Loan would have given us  more had time allowed. I want to say to Mr O&rsquo;Loan that environmental regulation  is very important to me &mdash; too important to be dealt with by an unelected body.  The financial cost of establishing that body is an issue, but it is not the  only issue. I listened very carefully to what he had to say about the article  in the &lsquo;Sunday Independent&rsquo;; it is not a periodical that I read, but I take his  word for what is in the article.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan stated that it is accountability and not the size  of the budget that is an important part of management structures. I find it  strange, therefore, that he would then go on to argue that we need an  independent environmental protection agency to deal with regulatory issues for  the 1&middot;7 million people in Northern    Ireland. The new Northern Ireland environment agency  will use effective and proportionate regulation to assist legitimate businesses  to comply with the law, and enforce sanctions against environmental crime.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I think it was Mr Ford who asked about opportunity costs  relating to environmental protection; he and Dr Farry have acknowledged that  just because one has an independent environmental protection agency, that does  not automatically mean that European infractions will stop. That being the  case, why, in Northern    Ireland, can we not have an effective way of  dealing with those issues that is within Government and within an  accountability mechanism? I have yet to hear an argument as to why an  independent environmental protection agency is the panacea for all of the  environmental wrongs in society.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As I said in my speech when launching the Northern Ireland  environment agency &mdash; I cannot remember what date it was; it was some time ago &mdash;  if I am proved wrong, there will be a review in three years time that will  examine all the options again, including the option for an independent  environmental protection agency. I am confident that the new Northern Ireland  environment agency will be able to deal with those issues and that the agency  will be made all the more stronger by the fact that it can, and will, be  scrutinsed by the Committee for the Environment and indeed by the House.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry mentioned the cost of division, and he is correct;  there are additional costs arising from divisions within society in Northern Ireland.  I know that he will accept that the levels of savings that can be realised in  the short to medium term are rather modest. I know that he is &mdash; as ever &mdash;  looking to the future. Executive Ministers will need to consider the steps that  they can take to reduce unnecessary costs, which inevitably reduce the standard  of public service provided to the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The incoming Minister of Finance and Personnel will examine  the paper that Dr Farry is preparing &mdash; and we are all looking forward to that  paper because it has been some time in the making. I understand that the paper  was promised in January, but I am sure that it will be very good when it lands  with the new Minister.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry mentioned funding for the arts and creative  industries, which do make an important contribution to the economy of Northern Ireland  as well as to social well-being. However, it is important to recognise that  spending on culture and arts in Northern Ireland  is broadly comparable with that in the rest of the United Kingdom. That is important,  because the figures are sometimes misquoted. It was recognised in the Budget,  when additional funding was allocated to DCAL to address concerns expressed  about arts, sports and library funding that were raised during the public  consultation on the draft Budget. People sometimes say that the consultations  that take place in relation to draft Government documents do not really mean  anything and are not taken into account. However, that was a clear example of  Government reacting to the public consultation.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, DCAL has secured &pound;5 million over the next  three years to establish a creative industries seed-fund to support business  enterprise in the creative industries sector. That is a competitive fund that  will provide creative entrepreneurs with assistance on business planning,  marketing, advice on access to venture capital, and intellectual property  issues, as well as start-up finance.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry also made mention of Varney II, and the size of  the public sector. In his second report, David Varney endorsed the Executive&rsquo;s  focus on economic development. The Executive and the Assembly need to seriously  consider Varney&rsquo;s recommendations in the light of our commitments to improve  productivity. That will help to address the issue of the relative size of our  public sector, but it must be clear that that matter concerns the relevant size  of both the public and private sectors. The key aim must be to grow the private  sector, rather than to shrink the public sector.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry also stated that the health budget was not big  enough. As he is aware, the 2008-09 health budget includes a resource budget of  &pound;4&middot;139 billion, and a gross capital budget of &pound;262 million. That totals &pound;4&middot;345  billion, which is approximately 48% of the Northern Ireland Budget level &mdash; the  highest level on record. As the Finance Minster has stated, it is not just the  size of a Budget that is important, but how it is used and managed to deliver  effective high-quality services.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The article that Mr O&rsquo;Loan quoted concerned accountability  mechanisms and how the Budget should be used in the most effective way. The  allocation to the Department of Health, along with the package of measures to  provide greater financial flexibility will enable that Department to cover its  very substantial cost pressures, to pay for drug costs, as well as delivering  significant service improvements in 2008-2009. The latest figures show that Northern Ireland continues to spend more per  head on health and social care than England.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Sammy Wilson then referred to the differential between  primary and post-primary funding &mdash; an issue that he has raised on many  occasions. The key driver of funding, the age-weighted pupil unit weightings,  are higher for post-primary pupils because the nature of the post-primary  curriculum, its mode of delivery and the extensive support arrangements &mdash; such  as staffing, equipment and resource materials &mdash; are quite different from that  of the primary sector. It is more expensive in the main. I know that the  Minster of Education is making provision for an increase in primary pupil  weighting, with a view to progressively increasing the relative funding. I know  that the Chairperson of that Committee will be glad to see that happening.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we ensure that there are no  inefficiencies that could distort funding levels. Jennifer McCann mentioned the  level of underspends in the various Departments, and I agree with her that  Departments must and can do better in relation to their departmental  underspends &mdash; including my own. High levels of underspend are not simply a  financial nicety, but have real impacts on the level and standard of services  provided to the public.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague, the outgoing Finance Minister, has raised  that matter on a number of occasions. In the House last week, he stated that  the time had come to consider the introduction of targets and sanctions at the  organisational and personal level. Ms McCann also raised the issue of social  problems, and the broader concern of the need to them, in particular the  increasing costs facing all our households.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Executive&rsquo;s key priority to grow the economy  will address many of those issues, it is important that Ministers seek to  improve all aspects of people&rsquo;s lives in Northern Ireland. Mr Durkan made  mention of cross-departmental funds, and reflected on the old Executive  programme funds. Although that appeared to work, there was a level of  underspend in those Executive programme funds. It was considered that making  those funds available to the Departments would cut out the bureaucracy that is  associated with them.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Kelly made the point that there were pros and cons in  respect of those funds, and that is why it was felt that that those should be  mainstreamed for the sake of efficiency. That is why they were mainstreamed.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd spoke about tax-varying powers. He felt that  there was a need to do away with the economic over-dependence on our national  Parliament.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd was, of course, engaged in distraction politics.  Before he rose to speak, there was much debate about the education issue, so he  decided to move us on to the issue of tax-varying powers. Tax is a double-edged  sword. Raising taxes would damage the local economy&rsquo;s competitiveness, and  cutting them would have to be financed by the Executive under the Azores ruling. The Varney Review II confirmed that the  local economy&rsquo;s future is in the hands of the Executive, and we must maximise  the opportunities afforded to us as part of the United Kingdom economy.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd also made comments on inefficiencies in the  education and library boards and the amount of money that they return. However,  the education and library boards are not just about money; accountability also  matters, and I have used that term throughout the debate. We look forward to  keeping our education authorities democratic; that done, we can consider  proposals in that sector.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I apologise to Mr Maginness for not being in the Chamber  when he was speaking. He raised the issue of asset disposal and said that  predicating the Budget on asset disposals was a risky strategy. Asset disposals  represent the release of funds that are tied up, unused or underutilised. When  they are sold, the associated holding cost is released. The fact that market  values have changed is relevant, but it does not suggest that the strategy is  flawed. Fundamentally, the Executive are in the business of public-service  provision, not property speculation &mdash; perhaps that is just as well. That does  not mean, however, that the way in which we deal with those issues is flawed.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Maginness also spoke of the &pound;170 million underspend as  lost to the Executive. The Member is right to highlight the need for  Departments to reduce the level of underspend, however, I remind him that the  money is not lost to the Executive, and is available for public services in the  future.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Maginness also suggested that DFP must get its act  together and sort out those issues. Talking about the Executive as though they  were not a four-party mandatory coalition is a trait of the SDLP. Dominic  Bradley said that the Executive were lacking in leadership and vision, despite  the fact that the Executive have an SDLP member. Declan O&rsquo;Loan told us that the  SDLP shows no ambiguity in relation to the Budget and that his party is united  in its stance on it. However, the SDLP Minister voted for the Budget. That  semi-detached attitude to the Executive does no one any good.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP must recognise that the Executive are a four-party  mandatory coalition, and it must play its part in supporting the decisions,  often difficult, taken by the Executive. I remind that party that the Budget  was agreed unanimously by all members of the Executive. The key task for all  Ministers is to get on with delivery, improve public services and avoid  repetition of the underspend that we saw this year, not to fight continually  over the Budget figures.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">David Ford spoke about mental health. I understand that the  Health Minister intends to allocate an additional &pound;19 million in 2008-09 to  mental health and learning disability services. He and the rest of the  Executive hope that that will go a long way towards implementing the  recommendations of the Bamford Review.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">David Ford and Stephen Farry talked about overinvestment in  the roads infrastructure. However, there are several arguments for putting more  money into that infrastructure: it relieves congestion and improves journey  times; it improves the quality of life and provides development opportunities;  it balances the development of Northern Ireland by improving access to the  north-west and south-west; and &mdash; importantly, from the point of view of my  Department &mdash; it improves road safety, which I know is dear to Mr Ford&rsquo;s heart.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The allocation of some &pound;56&middot;5 million to transport will  allow for continued capital investment in both bus and rail services. That will  enable Translink to continue funding its bus-replacement programme, and NI  Railways to continue its programme of significant capital works. It will also  enable the commencement of preparatory work on the proposed rapid-transit line  in greater Belfast.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There is no need to spend substantial amounts of money on  sustainable transport, and I know that the Member will agree with that. There  are more innovative ways to bring sustainable transport into this country, such  as the creation of cycle lanes, which do not cost much money.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gallagher raised the final point on the excess vote for  the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. Indeed, Mr  Gallagher is probably the only Member who raised that issue today. In 2006-07,  the Department incurred an excess vote on its superannuation scheme accounts,  because it failed to take account of a reduction in its creditors. That was not  highlighted in 2006-07 as additional cash, and it was taken from the  departmental vote instead of the Consolidated Fund. I understand from the Department  that it has undertaken a commitment to prevent a recurrence, including separate  banking arrangements being set up this month for the superannuation vote.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I have tried to cover all Members&rsquo; comments. However, if I  have failed to do so, departmental officials will respond to each Member  concerned when they have read the Hansard report. I thank all Members who contributed  to the debate. In a democracy, it is important to hear the views of elected  public representatives and to debate issues fully. Therefore, I ask all Members  to support the motions.</p>

	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that, under Standing Order 35(2), the Further  Consideration Stage of a Bill is restricted to debating any further amendments  tabled to the Bill. As no amendments have been tabled, there will be no  opportunity today to discuss the Mesothelioma etc., Bill. Members will,  however, be able to have a full debate during the Bill&rsquo;s Final Stage. The  Further Consideration Stage of the Bill is, therefore, concluded. The Bill  stands referred to the Speaker.</p>
