                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received notice from the Minister of
                the Environment that he wishes to make a statement on the
                British-Irish Council Environment Sectoral Group meeting held in
                London on Monday 2&nbsp;October.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of the Environment (Mr Foster): </b>Following
                nomination by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister,
                Mr Martin McGuinness and I represented the Northern Ireland
                Executive at a meeting of the British-Irish Council on the
                Environment on 2 October. The UK Government were represented by
                the Environment Minister, Mr Michael Meacher MP, who chaired the
                meeting. The Irish Government were represented by Mr Noel
                Dempsey TD, Minister for the Environment and Local
                Government. The meeting was also attended by representatives of
                the Scottish Executive, <b> </b>the National Assembly for Wales, the
                Isle of Man Government<b> 
                </b>
 and the States of Jersey and Guernsey.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A full list of delegates is attached to the
                communiqué that was issued after the meeting and placed in the
                Assembly Library. This statement has been agreed by Mr
                McGuinness and is being made on his behalf.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the first summit meeting of the
                British-Irish Council, on 17 December 1999, the environment was
                selected as an issue for early discussion. The UK Government
                were tasked with taking the lead in this area and under the
                chairmanship of Mr Meacher, the environment sectoral group was
                established to consider the environmental issues affecting the
                member Administrations and to report back.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The members agreed that the group would
                provide a valuable forum for the exchange of information and the
                discussion of matters of mutual interest. The group discussed a
                wide range of priority areas for future consideration. These
                included: the impacts on the environment of climate change,
                agriculture and aquaculture; waste management, waste recycling
                and radioactive and chemical wastes; water quality under the
                water framework directive; and environmental research. Many of
                these were put forward by the Northern Ireland Administration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After discussion the group agreed that
                consideration over the next few months should concentrate on
                radioactive waste from the Sellafield site, in respect of which
                the Irish Government and the Isle of Man would lead the
                preparation of a paper for the next meeting; the impacts of
                climate change, in respect of which the United Kingdom
                Government would take the lead; and waste management, in respect
                of which the Scottish Executive would prepare a paper on
                initiatives being pursued in Scotland. The work will be
                progressed by working groups of officials under the leadership
                of each Administration, who will report back to the environment
                sectoral group.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I expressed a particular interest in water
                quality management in the context of the Water Framework
                Directive, and it is my expectation that consideration will be
                given to this at subsequent meetings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The group also considered a paper by the
                United Kingdom Government which reviewed the conclusions of the
                OSPAR regional quality status report on the Celtic seas. The
                group reviewed the issues of concern identified in the report
                and the ways in which they are being dealt with in various
                forums. It was agreed that a high level of liaison and
                co-operation should continue between the Administrations
                concerned to facilitate the implementation of all appropriate
                measures and the identification of any new initiatives that may
                be required. It was agreed that periodic reports on progress
                should be provided to the group.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the group considered and agreed the
                text of the communiqué which was issued after the meeting. A
                copy of the communiqué has been placed in the Assembly Library.
                The next meeting of the environment sectoral group will be
                hosted by the Scottish Executive.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his report on the
                British-Irish Council meeting. It is no surprise that the first
                highlighted item was radioactive discharge into the Irish Sea
                from Sellafield, although the heading refers to waste from
                Sellafield. Can the Minister confirm that in dealing with
                radioactive waste from the Sellafield site he will be dealing
                not only with the high and medium grade waste stored on land but
                also with the discharges of low level radioactive waste into the
                Irish Sea? Can he indicate whether or not the British Government
                — the major shareholders of the main offender, British Nuclear
                Fuels Ltd (BNFL) — have declared an interest in this matter?
                The British Government signed the OSPAR agreement. In July 1998
                they indicated that they would reduce radioactive waste into the
                Irish Sea to nil by 2020. In view of the fact that they have
                further licence to reprocess particularly at the MOX plant at
                Sellafield, how do they propose to achieve zero outflow by 2020
                if they are increasing the discharges?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The operation of the Sellafield plant and its
                impact on the Irish Sea is of considerable interest to some
                sections of the Northern Ireland public, and Mr McGrady shows
                great interest in it. So far as I am aware, the levels of
                radioactivity measured by the Environment and Heritage Service
                are of negligible radiological significance. The Environment and
                Heritage Service arranges for samples of seaweed, sediment, fish
                and shellfish to be collected quarterly for analysis. We also
                monitor the air over coastal intertidal sediments. This reveals
                minimum amounts of radioactivity which are consistent with
                normal background levels. The Northern Ireland programme has
                been in place since the early 1970s and is reviewed annually to
                ensure that any changes in discharge are assessed — for
                example, the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (THORP) Start-Up
                Scheme in 1994. I can assure Members that these issues have come
                to our attention, and that the level of radioactivity measured
                in the environment is not of any great significance.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Environment Committee
                (Rev Dr William McCrea):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his statement and
                for raising many issues which will be of interest to my
                Committee. I note that working groups are to be set up to deal
                with specific issues. Will the groups include staff from
                Northern Ireland? If not, why not?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Radioactive waste from Sellafield is an
                important issue. Is the Minister’s Department monitoring the
                effects of Sellafield discharge around the Northern Ireland
                coastline? If so, what are the findings? Northern Ireland
                produces less than 3·5% of the United Kingdom’s total
                greenhouse gas emissions, yet we are still affected by the
                impact of climate change and cannot afford to be complacent. Are
                there specific plans to further reduce these emissions in
                Northern Ireland?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Waste management is topical and we had a
                helpful exchange on the issue last week. I note that a paper on
                waste management initiatives in Scotland is to be presented to
                the sectoral group, and local councils are currently drafting
                plans for departmental perusal. Does the Minister think that
                Scotland can show Northern Ireland the way forward, and can he
                say which particular initiatives will be of local interest?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, on a personal note, I note that
                Martin McGuinness, Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA Member, was at the
                meeting. As the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party has decided
                that Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA is to be banned from North/South
                bodies, can the Minister confirm that this ban will be extended
                to the British-Irish Council meetings?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member’s last question is one for my
                leader to answer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One question concerned the officials who will
                be operating —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the sake of clarity, let me point out
                that it is the First Minister who would deal with the Member’s
                question. I know that the Minister’s leader and the First
                Minister are one and the same person, but technically it is a
                matter for the First Minister.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, it is for the First Minister to decide,
                and I cannot answer for him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Officials from the Environment and Heritage
                Service will play a full part in the working groups.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Environment and Heritage Service has 40
                estuarine and coastal monitoring points around Northern Ireland.
                These include seven stations that are part of the UK’s
                national marine monitoring programme, which sets the protocols
                for best practice in marine monitoring. These arrangements apply
                at all our sampling sites. My Department and the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development are working together on the
                nutrient enrichment of our sea loughs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of the Environment’s draft
                budget includes £3·5 million to help local district councils
                to implement the waste management strategy. Three waste
                management planning groups have been formed representing all 26
                district councils and their plans are due by June 2001. A
                consultation paper on partnerships between councils and with the
                private and voluntary sectors to implement the strategy was
                issued in August. Further planned work includes the
                establishment of a new advisory board to help my Department in
                implementation of the waste management strategy, the issue of
                planning policy statement on planning and waste management and
                the introduction of further waste management regulations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While local authorities in Northern Ireland
                are working out their waste management plans, in Scotland
                recycling markets and other initiatives are well progressed, and
                we may be able to follow the lead of the Scots, take their
                advice and adopt their guidelines.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McLaughlin:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                thank the Minister for his statement. I welcome the study into
                radioactive waste from Sellafield, and I hope the Minister took
                the opportunity to raise the issue of cancer clusters on the
                east coast, which affect not only the Irish Government but also
                the Assembly. These are issues in which we take a close
                interest.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, my response to the Minister’s
                statement relates to two closely interconnected issues in
                particular — the impacts of climate change and waste
                management. We can no longer deny the consequences of these: we
                have all seen the daily weather bulletins and the images of
                flooding in recent days. I would be interested to know how much
                more advanced the Scottish Executive’s waste management
                programme is. Did they, for example, bring any information to
                that meeting that indicated that they were putting structures
                and legislation in place to ensure that we control the level of
                waste being produced as well as procedures for reuse and
                recycling?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Waste management is very much advanced in
                Scotland, and, as I said in my earlier answer, we are willing to
                take advice from Scotland and its officials, with whom our
                officials are in touch. We will willingly take any guidance or
                help we can get. They do seem to be a little bit more advanced
                than we are in this part of the world. We are willing to follow
                that through and take from it what is beneficial.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member referred to the treacherous
                climate change. The Department of the Environment fully supports
                the climate change programme currently being drawn up by the
                Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions and the
                devolved Administrations. The programme will set out a range of
                measures to meet the UK’s Kyoto obligations for a 12·5% cut

                commissioned to identify the key areas in which climate change
                is most likely to have an impact on Northern Ireland. The
                results of this preliminary study will form the basis for future
                work on climate change here. The most likely areas requiring
                detailed attention are water resources, flood protection,
                buildings, habitats and land use planning. The Member referred
                to waste management. This is a big issue, and it is going to be
                a difficult one. It will be a slow, educational process. We are
                willing to work on it in co-ordination with the Scottish people.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the environment conference on 25 October
                with the Prime Minister, the CBI and the Green Alliance, it was
                announced that moneys would be made available — to the tune of
                about £100 million — through the Carbon Trust and the New
                Opportunity Trust, to encourage cleaner technologies such as
                wind, solar power and renewable energy, and to help further
                engage consumers with initiatives. Did the Minister get an
                opportunity to discuss a share of this money for Northern
                Ireland, which would work out at about £2·5 million?</p>

                matters. However, those are certainly issues that we will follow
                through and address, because if money is available, we want to

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement,
                although it seems that the major question that must be asked of
                most of the statement is &quot;When?&quot; A number of
                priorities were highlighted, and there is great concern in the
                Chamber and outside about matters such as Sellafield. Perhaps it
                would have been beneficial if the Minister had given us some
                idea of the timing of any changes within Sellafield and of his
                Administration’s approach to the running down of the plant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Climate change and waste management are

                Department’s remit, will be dealt with by the British-Irish

                the three groups in Northern Ireland on waste management will
                not be delayed now that the Executive is in consultation with
                the Scots in the British-Irish Council? When and how quickly can
                we expect action?</p>

                management strategy will be finalised, but I assure Members that
                the Department will pursue all the issues with haste, to the

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his statement. In a
                sense, the environment is an eminently suitable subject for the
                British-Irish Council. Environmental issues can spill over —
                technically and literally — from one country or jurisdiction
                to another. A co-operative approach is therefore welcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister highlighted the important issue
                of climate change. Our country — the United Kingdom — has
                made considerable progress in implementing so-called carbon
                taxing, including the climate change levy on energy prices and
                the escalator on transport fuel. Both of those moves have, of
                course, caused problems, as we have previously noted. The
                Republic of Ireland’s Government have been much slower than
                the United Kingdom’s to adopt the practice and the principle
                of taxing economic activity according to the amount of
                climate-changing carbon that is produced. What progress is being
                made through the British/Irish Council to persuade the Dublin
                Government, like the United Kingdom Government, to take more
                seriously their international obligations on climate change?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Climate change is a big issue. Each
                jurisdiction has a responsibility to fulfil, and that will be
                vigorously pursued. If the Republic of Ireland is falling
                behind, that issue will be pursued with its Government. I am
                concerned about climate change. There is clear scientific
                evidence that sufficient damage has already been done to the
                earth’s climate to cause a range of potential changes,
                regardless of the influence of action under Kyoto.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Key policies include improving businesses’
                use of energy, using the climate change levy; stimulating new,
                more efficient forms of power generation such as renewables,
                combined heat and power plants; cutting transport emissions
                through fuel efficiency and taxation; promoting better energy
                efficiency in the domestic sector; reducing emissions from
                agriculture through better management, cuts in fertiliser usage
                and energy efficiency; and setting a good example of green
                housekeeping in the public sector. The Department of the
                Environment, in conjunction with the Scotland and Northern
                Ireland Forum for Environmental Research (SNIFFER), is about to
                commission a major scoping study into the impacts of climate
                change in Northern Ireland. The results of that preliminary
                study will form the basis for future work on climate change.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Member said, the Phillips report
                included some very serious statements and set out actions to be
                taken. Sir John Krebs, the chairman of the Food Standards
                Agency, welcomed the publication of the report on the Phillips
                inquiry into BSE on Thursday 26 October 2000, and pledged that
                vital information on food safety risks would never again be
                withheld from the public. He also said that many of the key
                changes identified by the inquiry as being necessary to protect
                consumers had already been adopted by the agency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The FSA has made a clean start on openness
                and public accountability; its research and advice are open to
                scrutiny, and where there is uncertainty or risk the agency says
                so. The FSA has been reviewing BSE controls since April 2000 and
                has held a series of public meetings. It will submit a report to
                Health and Agriculture Ministers in Westminster, the Welsh
                Assembly, the Scottish Parliament and this Assembly, taking
                account of the report of the BSE inquiry.</p>

                confidence to the consumer — not only in Northern Ireland but
                across the world — and regain local producers’ lost export
                business. Openness and transparency are of great importance. I
                hope that lessons have been learnt from the experience of
                previous Administrations. The Minister briefly referred to those
                lessons in relation to BSE, a devastating disease. Will the
                agency be able to bring its full authority to bear in examining
                all the food that is imported into Northern Ireland? Will that
                come under the FSA’s umbrella?</p>

                said about openness and transparency. The statement shows
                clearly that the agency believes such things to be paramount.
                The FSA will work with local enforcement agencies to improve
                quality and has made a framework agreement with them. The agency
                will also work with the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development, setting out overall strategic objectives and
                monitoring their enforcement. Through setting these objectives,
                monitoring and working with other agencies, the FSA will be able
                to ensure that food safety is paramount from the farm gate to

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the issue of transparency and openness,
                the Food Standards Act 1999 gives the agency the power to
                publish its advice to Ministers, and this principle is embodied
                in its proposed code of practice on openness. The agency will
                normally publish the advice and information it receives and
                provides to others. It is committed to issuing clear and timely
                advice, in plain language, on all issues relating to food safety
                and other consumer interests regarding food. In addition, a
                large amount of information on the Food Standards Agency, its
                responsibilities and activities will be included on its website.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will briefly explain how the agency will
                act on occasions when there is scientific uncertainty. The
                proposed statement on the agency’s approach to risk — on
                which it is currently consulting — describes, in general
                terms, how it intends to deal with risks from the time when the
                agency first becomes aware of them through to the decision
                making and enforcement stages. The agency will take a
                precautionary approach — it will not always wait until it has
                proof of a potential hazard before acting or issuing advice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the issue of working with other bodies to
                promote food safety, it is clear that the Food Safety Promotion
                Board will have the lead role. The Food Standards Agency will
                have a role in working on draft legislation and will provide, in
                an EU context, advice to the Assembly and Ministers. The two
                bodies do not carry out the same functions but a relationship
                between the local executive of the Food Standards Agency and the
                Food Safety Promotion Board will be needed. To facilitate
                effective co-operation, a concordat will be put in place
                following agreement by the two bodies, which will set out the
                arrangements for co-operation and liaison.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement on food
                standards. The theme running through this document starts with
                basing decisions on best scientific advice; later it refers to
                sound scientific advice and finally it recognises there is
                uncertainty in the science. How does the Minister and this
                agency propose to reconcile the three situations? It is
                realistic to say that there is uncertainty, so how do they
                propose to identify the best advice?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agency’s Statement of General
                Objectives and Practices contains the following objective:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;To ensure that the interests of UK
                consumers in relation to food are effectively promoted within
                the European Union and in other international forums.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a fairly ineffective statement of
                intent. The problem we have with food standards in the United
                Kingdom is that, whilst the food produced within the United
                Kingdom is subject to rigorous standards, the food that is
                imported and sold on the same supermarket shelves is not subject
                to anything like the same standards. Do the Minister and her
                colleagues propose to address this matter, with a view to
                providing some means of protection to consumers in the United
                Kingdom from imported food subject to much less rigorous
                standards?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I addressed the issue of how the agency will
                deal with the uncertainties in my previous response. It will
                work on the basis of the best scientific advice available, and,
                as the Food Safety Agency, it will have access to scientific
                advice from England, Scotland, Wales and here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The local board of the agency will have
                access to that advice. Given the precautionary principle, that
                will be the key basis for informing decisions and informing the
                agency, so where there is uncertainty, that is how it will be
                approached. Indeed, it is of paramount importance that the
                consumers have clear advice and clear, open information about
                the state of play.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards setting policy, it will also try
                to ensure that there is open consultation with a wide range of
                people. When the agency is making decisions, such as setting
                overall parameters in the importing of products, it will consult
                with all of those who could be or are affected — it is
                currently preparing guidance on that — and, in line with the
                agency’s commitment to improve continually the way that
                consultation is conducted, it will invite stakeholders to
                comment on the guidance that it has.</p>

                statement, and particularly the emphasis she put on the openness
                and transparency of the working practices of the Food Standards
                Agency. Did she take note of the work that agency has done in
                the UK in that the entire sheep flock is to be screened in case
                there is BSE in that flock masquerading as scrapie? In the light
                of the openness and transparency that the Minister emphasised so
                much, can she advise us of the position in Northern Ireland and
                what plans the Food Standards Agency here has for this?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The more general questions in respect of the
                handling of BSE will be dealt with in a statement tomorrow. I
                can say that the controls for sheep were introduced on a
                precautionary basis as a risk-reduction measure, since BSE has
                never been found in the flock. These controls are regarded as
                adequate, although there is a great deal of uncertainty about
                BSE and sheep, and the agency considers that it is important to
                clear this up, so it is pressing for further and faster
                research.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the consistent approach to the
                Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the funding of the agency, the
                £90 levy has been dropped, but a charge will be made by way of
                a licence fee. People are worried that these licence fees could
                be as much as £600 per shop or establishment. Some were already
                saying that the £90 was too much. Would it not have been better
                to ensure that the extra work for local environmental health
                groups was funded centrally through the Government?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also like to have a commitment that
                the promotion of public health will be given equal status to the
                protection of public health, and I want to know exactly how that
                will work. Paragraph&nbsp;11 of the statement mentions the fact
                that the agency’s information should be placed in the public
                domain. Can we have a commitment on that or, if necessary, a
                clear reason that it should not be so? I am concerned that we
                may not have the transparency that Mr McCarthy and Mr Leslie
                talked about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for the pooling of resources, the
                statement refers to provision for technical and scientific
                specialist support although, in many cases, local government is
                already doing that. I want to ensure that there are sufficient
                resources and that the system we have will work effectively.</p>

                hygiene conditions; documented hazard analysis and critical
                control points; food safety management controls; and improved
                hygiene training for staff. A charge of £100 will be payable by
                businesses to the issuing authority on receipt on the licence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the promotion of food safety,
                it is clear from the agency’s statement that it has set itself
                the target of measurably improving public confidence and public
                information. Openness will be pursued as one of its key
                objectives. The agency will conduct and publish annual consumer
                attitude surveys on food issues and on the Food Standards Agency
                itself. It will publish annual reports concerning its scientific
                and surveillance work, in a manner which consumers can
                understand. It will enhance its website so that that is
                completely interactive by 2002, thereby allowing the public to
                tell the agency what they would like it to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Facilities to provide consumer advice will be
                developed, and new approaches that harness recent developments
                in e-technology will be piloted. The agency will hold public
                board meetings and open discussions in order to listen to, and
                act upon, public concerns. It will also encourage local
                authorities to publish local information on hygiene standards in
                food premises. Details of the performance of enforcement
                activities will be made public. Availability of research results
                will be increased and a system for post hoc audits of major food
                incidents, involving the relevant stakeholders, will be
                established. It is important to note that the agency can provide
                and publish advice to Ministers without having to seek
                ministerial approval.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the withholding of
                information, the proposed code of practice on openness makes the
                disclosure and publication of advice and information the norm.
                In accordance with this principle, information will only be
                withheld when strictly necessary. The code of practice on
                openness lists the various legal constraints on publication.
                Openness will be the key factor in the agency’s operation.</p>

                seeking to strengthen and develop links with those in local
                authorities responsible for enforcing food laws.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As part of this joint Government and local
                authority initiative, a group was set up in May 1999, which

                the group’s work, and that of the two sub-groups established
                to examine the details, was the development of proposals for the
                Food Standards Agency framework agreement. Those draft proposals
                were issued in April for a three-month consultation period,
                which concluded in July. The majority of comments received
                largely supported the underlying principles of the framework
                agreement. Therefore the agency has set in place, and is
                continuing to set in place, specific written policies and
                practices to ensure proper co-ordination of all aspects of its

                different types of work, although they work in the same area and
                we will need to have overlapping arrangements. Clearly — <i>[Interruption]</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That the Second Stage of the Family Law Bill
                [NIABill 4/00] be agreed.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I present this short Bill because of my
                responsibility for law reform, with particular reference to
                family law, in Northern Ireland. The Bill contains only a few
                policy aims, but they are very significant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill seeks to facilitate the acquisition
                of parental responsibility by unmarried fathers for their
                children. As an ancillary measure it also seeks to make the
                acquisition of parental responsibility by step-parents for the
                children of their spouses more transparent. At present the usual
                method is through the formal adoption of a child, but this
                should not always be necessary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill also creates a statutory presumption
                of paternity in two sets of circumstances — where a man is
                married to a woman at any time between the conception and birth
                of a child, and where he has been registered as the child’s
                father in the Register of Births, Deaths and Marriages.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill also seeks to update the law on the
                range of tests that a court may authorise to be used to prove or
                disprove the parentage of a child. Parentage in this context is
                whether someone is or is not the mother or father of a child.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill contains only three substantive
                clauses. I will deal with each of them and illustrate how they
                will interact with existing family law principles. Members have
                already seen the Bill and the accompanying explanatory and
                financial memorandum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will make some preliminary remarks about
                the policy behind the reforms. In Northern Ireland, marriage
                remains the norm for couples wishing to share their lives with
                their children, and in that situation husbands and wives share
                parental responsibility for their children. However, more
                couples are choosing not to marry — at least not straight away
                — but they desire to establish a family relationship with
                children. In 1998, for example, 6,743 live births occurred
                outside marriage. This represented 28·5% of all live births. In
                such cases only the mother will have parental responsibility for
                the child. The unmarried father will have no formal legally
                recognised relationship with the child, although he can
                establish such a relationship by marrying the child’s mother
                or by taking other steps to acquire parental responsibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parental responsibility is defined in the
                Children Order (Northern Ireland) 1995 as</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;all the rights, duties, powers,
                responsibilities and authority which by law a parent of a child
                has in relation to the child and his property&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no exhaustive list of what a parent
                may or may not do for a child, but parental responsibility
                includes decision-making powers with regard to education, health
                care, religion and other everyday matters, and the law relies on
                the courts to determine the extent of parental responsibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposals in the Bill do not seek to pass
                judgement on the different family relationships which adults
                choose for themselves and their children. They seek to ensure
                that, where appropriate, the child’s interests are secured by
                the legal recognition of the relationship with the child’s
                father and others such as step-parents who share in the
                day-to-day care of the child.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A step-parent, whether a man or a woman, has
                no biological tie to the child of his or her spouse. However,
                the step-parent has demonstrated a commitment to a family
                relationship by marrying one of the parents of the child. The
                Bill provides that a step-parent would be able to acquire
                parental responsibility for the child of a spouse only under a
                court order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second policy aim of the Bill is to place
                on a statutory footing the existing common-law presumption that
                a man who is married to a woman between the conception and birth
                of the child will be presumed to be the father of the child. The
                additional policy aspect is to create a new legal presumption
                that a man who is registered as the father of the child in the
                Register of Births, Deaths and Marriages will be presumed, in
                law, to be the father of the child. This will, I believe, simply
                be a clarification of what is normally understood by the public,
                although this presumption is not a legal one under the existing
                law.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill will also update the law on the
                range of tests that a court may direct to be used if a child’s
                parentage is in dispute. Since the passing of the Family Law
                Reform Order 1977, there have been significant advances in the
                technology available to prove or disprove biological parentage.
                Courts in Northern&nbsp;Ireland should now be able to rely on
                new technology in deciding cases of disputed parentage. The
                policy which this Bill seeks to implement has been under
                consideration in Scotland, England and Wales, and it is likely
                that similar proposals will be brought forward in due course.
                Traditionally family law has been very similar across the
                jurisdictions, with Northern&nbsp;Ireland law following the
                changes made elsewhere. In this instance I am pleased to say
                that the Assembly has an opportunity to take the lead. With the
                large population movement across these islands, there is a
                strong argument for maintaining a degree of parity in sensitive
                issues such as family law so that legal relationships between
                children and their parents are recognised, hence the
                responsibility for taking decisions for children. That is an
                important, practical point with regard to health care and
                education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will now address each of the substantive
                clauses of the Bill. Under the Children (Northern&nbsp;Ireland)
                Order&nbsp;1995 unmarried fathers only acquire parental
                responsibility for their children if they take steps to
                demonstrate their commitment to the mother and child. The
                principal mechanisms are by entering into a parental
                responsibility agreement with the mother, which is registered in
                the High Court, or by obtaining an order from the court. Since
                the Children Order came into force those two mechanisms have not
                been used as often as had been hoped. As a result the vast
                majority of unmarried fathers have no formal legal relationship
                with their children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1999 fewer than 200&nbsp;parental
                responsibility orders were made in favour of unmarried fathers.
                A relatively small number of parental responsibility agreements
                have been registered with the courts, yet almost 7,000 children
                are born each year outside marriage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 1 provides that an unmarried father
                will have parental responsibility for his children if he and the
                mother jointly register the child’s birth. Members will note
                that the Bill provides that in Northern Ireland the unmarried
                father’s parental responsibility will be recognised if the
                birth of the child has been jointly registered in Scotland or
                England and Wales. A child’s birth can only be jointly
                registered by the mother and the unmarried father if they both
                agree to the procedure. This new provision will only apply to
                births registered after the Family Law Bill is introduced.
                Unmarried fathers of children already born, and jointly
                registered, will be advised of the availability of existing
                procedures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 1 also provides that a step-parent
                should be able to apply for a court order conferring
                responsibility for a child of his or her spouse. The court will
                always have the child’s welfare and best interests as the
                paramount consideration in deciding whether to make such an
                order. Where appropriate, the court takes the child’s views
                into account. The Bill provides that the acquisition of parental
                responsibility by a step-parent will not enable that step-parent
                to make decisions on the child’s adoption. This will prevent
                the new procedure from being used to circumvent the existing
                legislation regulating adoption. Where an unmarried father
                acquires parental responsibility by jointly registering the
                child’s birth, or where a step-parent acquires it by obtaining
                a court order, the court may terminate the parental
                responsibility if an application is made to the court. The fact
                that the court may do so provides a necessary protection for the
                child, and his or her mother, and is additional to the existing
                legislation in force to deal with violence in family
                relationships.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new provisions in clause 2 create a
                statutory presumption of paternity which are not wholly
                innovative. The first part of the clause merely seeks to codify
                an existing presumption of common law, which is that a man
                married to a woman at any time between the conception and birth
                of a child is presumed to be that child’s father. This, of
                course, is the truth in the vast majority of cases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the clause provides that where a
                man is registered as the father of a child, he will be presumed,
                in law, to be the father of that child. Again, this is common
                sense, although it is not presumed under existing common law.
                Considering the content of this Bill, it seems sensible to
                include these provisions as a useful clarification of what is
                recognised as the reality in almost all cases. In both
                instances, of course, the presumption of paternity may be
                rebutted on the balance of probabilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 3 is of a technical nature, because it
                amends existing provisions contained in the Family Law Reform
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1977. Under the existing legislation,
                if the paternity of a child is in dispute, a court may only
                direct that blood samples be taken from the child, or putative
                father, in order to determine parentage. The amendments in
                clause 3 will enable a court to direct that bodily samples, such
                as saliva or hair, may be taken for the purposes of scientific
                tests to determine parentage. This is undoubtedly a far less
                invasive and distressful procedure, particularly for children,
                than the existing procedures, and I consider it to be a major
                improvement on the human rights aspect of the current law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will wish to know that the amendments
                in clause 3 were drafted alongside parallel amendments contained
                in clause 65 of the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security
                Bill, which the Assembly has already considered and agreed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following from what I have said, I hope
                Members will appreciate that, while this is a small law reform
                measure, it has some far-reaching effects. The policy
                conclusions which the Bill seeks to implement have been decided
                after the most rigorous consultation processes and close
                analysis of developments in family law, not only in Northern
                Ireland but in other jurisdictions, such as Scotland, England,
                Wales, the Republic of Ireland and further afield. I am
                convinced that these proposals represent a small, but
                significant, improvement to the existing law. Some may say that
                they go too far and others that they do not go far enough. When
                legislation seeks to regulate family relationships we are right
                to adopt a progressive yet cautious approach.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will try to answer as many of the Members’
                points and questions during my winding-up speech as possible. Of

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Bill that the Minister has
                introduced today. It will make a number of common- sense
                amendments to current law. I sometimes think we do too much
                &quot;guinea-pigging&quot;, but I do not think there is any
                reason for caution in respect of this Bill. I welcome the fact
                that Northern Ireland is leading the way within the United
                Kingdom in these matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The existing law on parental responsibility
                is most likely to be largely misunderstood by a considerable
                number of unmarried fathers who are registered as a parent.
                There has been an assumption that that law puts them in a legal
                relationship with the child, but it does not. The change that
                the Bill will introduce to ensure that registering does
                constitute a legal relationship is very welcome, and in the vast
                majority of cases that will be appropriate. I know there may be
                certain circumstances in which it may not be deemed to be so,
                but they will be in the minority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister confirm that it is at the
                discretion of the mother of the child that joint registration
                will take place? It would thus remain the prerogative of the
                mother to decide whether she wants to register jointly with a
                male — the father of the child — and so create the legal
                relationship between that person and the child.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been some suggestions that
                measures in the Bill should have retrospective application. That
                has been resisted, and I agree with the decision. Generally, one
                has to be very cautious about applying legislation
                retrospectively. The existing procedures, under what will become
                the old law, are available to rectify a position were an
                unmarried father wants to be in a legal relationship and there
                is overall consent to that. One area where retrospective
                application would be very useful is in relation to tax cuts.
                However, that involves another aspect of the Minister’s remit
                and is a matter for another day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the last part of the Bill, which
                recognises the major changes in science that enable DNA testing
                to establish parenthood, is sensible and welcome. I generally
                welcome the Bill and give it my support.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Finance and Personnel
                Committee (Mr Molloy):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I welcome the Bill. This is an important stage we are going
                through. I speak as Chairperson of the Finance and Personnel
                Committee, which is dealing with the Bill. One of the issues
                that the Committee raised is that this type of Bill would
                probably be more suitable for, and sit better with, Health and
                Social Services or Social Development. We recommended to the
                Speaker that some of these Bills should be redirected. It is not
                a matter of getting out of the work — there are issues that
                would be dealt with by Health and Social Services or Social
                Development, and we need to have an input from those Departments
                and Committees to ensure that all the issues affected by this
                Bill are covered. However, the Bill is coming from the Office of
                Law Reform, so responsibility rests with Finance and Personnel.
                Our Committee will deal with it as quickly as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that we recognise the many
                issues in the Bill. There are human rights issues, competing
                rights issues, issues of father-and-children relationships and
                father-and-mother relationships. As the Deputy Chairperson has
                said, there is the matter of the mother having the final say and
                the matter of the Bill’s not being used as a means of
                exercising control without responsibility. That latter aspect
                was raised by a number of people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Human rights issues — and competing rights
                within those —will be raised by the Bill. I hope that members
                of other Committees who have issues that they want to raise will
                come forward to the Finance and Personnel Committee and raise
                them in the public sessions that will be held.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will also alert members of the public today
                that this is an issue that they can have an input in. The
                Finance and Personnel Committee wants to hear their views and
                there will be an open session for them to exercise that right.
                The Committee will deal with the Bill as speedily as possible,
                and I hope that we will have input from both Members and the
                public. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Bill. Mr Leslie mentioned its
                pioneering aspects, particularly the provision relating to
                unmarried fathers. If we value devolution and self-government,
                we should be innovative and pioneering. I will resist using the
                new verb that Mr Leslie has produced — &quot;to
                guinea-pig&quot; — but if one were to adopt that new verb, one
                should be prepared to be innovative. The term
                &quot;guinea-pigging&quot; is wrong because it suggests
                experimentation, and this is not necessarily experimentation.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reason this Bill comes before the House,
                and why it is necessary to initiate these reforms, is that we
                have seen a social revolution in how people wish to live
                together. Regrettably the traditional marriage family unit is
                now almost on a par with people simply cohabiting. There are
                other reasons for people to cohabit: family breakdowns, marriage
                breakdowns, and complicated life situations. The traditional
                family unit has been eroded — sometimes through choice, and
                sometimes not. In any event, the important thing to remember
                when dealing with this Bill is that we have a new situation, and
                we have to deal with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1998 there were 6,743 live births outside
                marriage, which represents 28·5% of all live births.
                Interestingly 4,348 of those births were registered jointly —
                both parents were registered on the birth certificates of those
                children. This indicates — and research by the Department and
                the Office of Law Reform appears to confirm it — that people
                want to declare publicly they are the parents, and implicit in
                that is a father’s accepting responsibility for his child.
                This Bill goes a long way to recognise that and enable unmarried
                fathers to acquire parental responsibility, an important public
                demonstration by unmarried fathers of that responsibility. This
                option is the best choice on the parts of the Department and the
                Office of Law Reform to deal with the new situation in society,
                and we should welcome the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also fair to say that there has been a
                very low uptake of existing legal mechanisms. That indicates
                that people are unaware of them or find them too cumbersome.
                That is an important point to take into consideration. The low
                uptake does not represent an unwillingness to take up
                responsibility. If one looks at the overall figure, one sees
                that 64% of unmarried fathers and mothers are prepared to
                register a birth jointly, so there clearly is a willingness to
                accept responsibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s proposed change to the law
                is to be welcomed. It is a common-sense way forward in this
                situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a reasonably good response to the
                Office of Law Reform’s consultation paper. The responses were
                of good quality. There was a consensus of support for this
                change. I also welcome the change in the way that parentage is
                determined, insofar as body samples will now be permitted. That
                is a significant step forward, because such procedures are less
                invasive than blood sampling. That is in keeping with the
                advance in our technology for determining parentage. I welcome
                that as well.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister used the word
                &quot;cautious&quot;. Until the Bill goes through the Committee
                Stage I will remain cautious about what amendments will be
                accepted. This is clearly an important piece of legislation,
                particularly as it is to be introduced into Northern Ireland
                simultaneously with a number of other pieces of legislation such
                as the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill, which
                we discussed the week before last. There is some overlap between
                these two pieces of legislation, and the explanatory notes
                acknowledge that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was pleased that the Chairperson of the
                Finance and Personnel Committee addressed the overlap of
                Statutory Committee business. This issue has come up before in
                the Business Committee, and the Chairperson said that the
                Speaker had been asked to address it. Where the subject matter
                of a piece of legislation falls within the remit of more than
                one Committee, the Chairpersons of those Committees should
                consult and agree to which Committee the matter should fall for
                disposal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am happy for this Bill to be considered by
                the Finance and Personnel Committee at this stage. However, the
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety Committee is currently
                dealing with an inter-country adoption Bill. That will be with
                us shortly. That Bill also addresses the issue of stepfathers
                and adoption. It may be important for our Committee to be asked
                to look at this, because Standing Order 48(2) goes further.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My question to the Minister is: was the
                question of which Committee should accept this Bill discussed in
                detail? I am aware that the Office of Law Reform’s
                responsibilities are part of the Minister’s portfolio, but
                given the particular details of this Bill, and given that the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is
                currently dealing with children’s rights and parental
                responsibilities, that process must be elaborated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this stage it is going to the Department
                of Finance and Personnel. I suggest that the public be made
                aware of that. The public does not understand the workings of
                the Assembly. I know that the Office of Law Reform had a
                consultation paper. As this goes through the Committee Stage,
                many people may think that this is something to do with children
                — which it is — and will not, therefore, be aware that the
                Department of Finance and Personnel is dealing with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly ought to look at ways of
                publishing its future business, showing which Committees are
                accepting which pieces of legislation. That is what the
                Oireachtas does. That should be published in newspapers. Given
                the impact of this legislation, parents — particularly those
                who have children outside marriage — should be made aware of
                the changes we are about to make.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding the overlapping of Committees, I
                hope that the Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                Committee will be invited to look at this issue and report to
                the Finance and Personnel Committee. When we came into the
                Assembly we made the important point that when dealing with
                children and families we should highlight interdepartmental
                responsibility and should not let anyone down by simply putting
                an issue into one box. Given the Health, Personal Social
                Services and Public Safety issues currently being discussed, I
                make a plea for us to have the right to make that input. I hope
                that will be welcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like the Minister to address further
                the issue, highlighted in his introduction, that a court may
                terminate some orders. This is probably the major concern. Alban
                Maginness addressed the issue of the changes in families and
                social trends. Some 7,000 children are born outside marriage,
                yet the Minister tells us that parental responsibility orders
                are in place for fewer than 200 of them. This will have a huge
                impact. The Minister may not be able to give me an immediate
                response, but how many of the 7,000 born outside marriage are
                jointly registered? Probably time will tell, given James Leslie’s
                understanding that joint registration is at the discretion of
                the mother. That may alarm some women, particularly in cases of
                violence. That is one of my major concerns, and I am therefore
                interested in the Minister’s point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like more detail on this. Parental
                rights may be laid down by joint registration, but shortly
                thereafter enormous problems can arise. For the protection of
                children and women, a court needs to address that issue very
                carefully. I note, from the human rights section of the
                explanatory notes, that it was argued, in the case of McMichael
                versus the UK, that the non-automatic granting of parental
                rights to unmarried fathers was a justified interference with
                family life to protect the rights of others — women and
                children — from unmeritorious fathers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not much has changed since that case went
                through. That is where my major concern lies. I have worked
                closely with those experiencing the enormous problems that arise
                in cases of sexual and physical abuse towards both children and
                their mothers. An issue also arises about custodial rights. It
                is extremely important that that should be addressed very
                carefully.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the issue of non-invasive methods of
                determining parenthood, it again looks as though a step forward
                is being taken. Anything non-invasive can only be useful, and we
                welcome the consultation process on this. The Children’s Law
                Centre, and others, may have some concerns on how this will be
                carried out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the largest problems is the
                determining of biological parenthood in the case of a father.
                Clearly that matter has wide implications for the Department for
                Social Development — it caused quite a discussion in the
                Assembly when the issue of child support came up. The biggest
                concern is whether this is a piece of legislation that can
                enable biological fathers to be determined — so that child
                support can then be paid accordingly — or whether it is for
                humanitarian reasons. All Assembly Members have been lobbied by
                a group called Families Need Fathers, which argues that Northern
                Ireland is dissimilar to England and Wales in relation to the
                rights of fathers. I ask the Minister to address that matter.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.00</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems that the point we are making today
                is that we are the first to introduce this legislation. In its
                responses to consultation, Families Need Fathers argued that it
                would like the situation in Northern Ireland to be similar to
                the situation everywhere else. That is causing some confusion. I
                take it that we are the first.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also important that this is seen as a
                package of family law reform. I am familiar with the excellent
                work carried out by the Office of Law Reform to date. I take the
                opportunity to commend it for leading the field on family law in
                Northern Ireland. Were it not for the work of the Office of Law
                Reform many families would have suffered because of the
                consequences of not taking on board recent trends and changes
                that research showed would need to be noted when legislation was
                being introduced in Northern Ireland. With that in mind I hope
                that the Office of Law Reform will follow that excellent
                tradition and that we will not introduce legislation which might
                lead to problems further down the road.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I generally welcome the proposals contained
                in the Bill, and I concur with a number of the comments that
                have already been made. I want to make some specific points, and
                I look forward to dealing with the Bill when it comes before the
                Finance and Personnel Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The clause relating to the presumption of
                parentage is, as the Minister has said, a tidying-up exercise.
                It puts existing common law on a statutory footing. That will
                not cause any great controversy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The clause dealing with tests for determining
                parentage is a step forward. The Minister indicated that the
                clause is in line with proposals and practices elsewhere, and he
                mentioned other parts of the UK, the Republic of Ireland, and so
                on. I am keen to know whether this matter has been given
                statutory effect in any of those regions or countries. The issue
                of &quot;guinea-pigging&quot; has been raised. Are we the first
                to give this matter legislative effect? The Minister seemed to
                indicate that it was happening elsewhere. The Bill is welcome
                nonetheless.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My main point concerns the first substantive
                clause, which deals with how unmarried fathers acquire legal
                parental rights. As the Minister indicated, the Children
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 sets out the current position in
                relation to acquiring parental responsibility, which is defined
                as</p>

                has in relation to the child and his property.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That takes us so far, but it does not set out
                what those rights, duties, powers and responsibilities are. It
                is almost nebulous. There are various provisions in law that
                deal with the issue. However, does the Minister, his Department
                or the Office for Law Reform have any plans for further defining
                those parental rights, duties powers, and so on? Have they
                considered what those rights should be as part of their work on
                this Bill or perhaps for a future Bill? They are not defined at
                present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maginness pointed out the figure of 28·5%
                as the number of live births outside marriage in 1998 in
                Northern Ireland. He rightly highlighted the impact of that
                figure. More than a quarter of all babies in Northern Ireland
                are born outside marriage. That is a significant figure, and it
                represents an issue that needs to be addressed, a major social
                issue, for which there are many reasons. It is interesting that
                in the case of almost 60% of live births the unmarried father
                registered jointly with the mother and, in so doing, was making
                a statement about taking legal responsibility. In many cases, as
                has been said, they were probably not aware that, in law, this
                was a pretty meaningless exercise. The purpose of this
                legislation is very welcome. It will be in line with what people
                think they are signing up to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that under the new
                provisions an unmarried father could only register with the
                agreement of the mother. We will look at this in detail when it
                comes before the Committee, but I would like to ask whether that
                provision — that caveat, as it were — is contained in the
                legislation. Will it be a statutory provision that a mother can
                refuse to allow the unmarried father to be registered? If it is
                not in the Bill, I would be interested to know where it is
                contained. It is important, as a number of Members have said,
                given the fact that registration will have a legal effect, which
                it does not have at the moment. Clearly we will look at some of
                these issues in detail, but it would be helpful if the Minister
                could give us an outline answer at this stage to some of the
                questions that have been asked.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In general terms, this Bill is to be
                welcomed, and we will certainly give it a fair wind.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr O’Hagan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I support the idea that this Bill should have a
                cross-departmental focus, particularly when it comes to health,
                social services and public safety. It is a Bill that needs to be
                dealt with sensitively and sensibly. My party has already been
                in preliminary consultations with individuals and groups — the
                stakeholders in this area — and a number of concerns have been
                expressed, particularly by people working at the coalface with
                victims of abusive relationships. There are some concerns that
                the parental responsibility order will be used by some men as a
                means of controlling the mother. I am not saying that that will
                happen in every case. It is also very clear that there are
                unmarried fathers who want to play a very positive role in the
                upbringing of their children. There needs to be a balance of the
                rights of mothers, fathers and children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are also some concerns about the
                future. What impact will this have, for example, on schooling or
                if a child goes into hospital? A father who may not have had
                anything to do with the day-to-day upbringing of the child —
                and in most cases it is the mother who is responsible for the
                day-to-day rearing of the child — could have an equal right to
                register the child in school and make decisions about hospital
                treatment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to be very careful. Many concerns
                have been expressed about this Bill. Like Monica McWilliams, I
                urge the Minister and his Department to ensure that members of
                the public are made fully aware that this Bill is before the
                Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wide consultation is needed with groups such
                as Families Need Fathers, women’s groups and lawyers, who are
                at the coalface defending and helping single mothers and victims
                of abusive relationships. I would like to see a good deal more
                debate on this, and I urge the Department to ensure that public
                consultation is as wide as possible during this Bill’s passage
                through the Committee Stage. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly, Members appreciate that this reform
                measure will have a significant impact on family relationships
                in Northern Ireland. I must rehearse certain points in order to
                deal with Members’ questions. In examining these law reform
                measures we have taken account of views expressed during the
                consultation which was carried out after the Office of Law
                Reform issued its proposals. I can reassure people that human
                rights and equality issues have been given particular
                consideration and that this will continue. We want to ensure
                that the rights of children are enhanced and that they are never
                compromised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Leslie welcomed the Bill and sought
                reassurance that the legislation would not apply
                retrospectively. The Bill will have no material effect on the
                legal responsibilities of parents of children whose births have
                already been registered. Similarly, we will ensure that there is
                a strong public awareness of the Bill. We will also try to
                ensure that a greater number of existing fathers are made more
                aware of the provisions available to them. Several Members have
                indicated that some fathers are making incorrect presumptions
                about current legal provisions. A widespread publicity campaign
                for the new legislation is expected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Leslie also asked me to confirm that
                joint registration is at the discretion of the mother. This is
                the case, and it is clear in the legislation. Mr&nbsp;Dodds
                asked if this is provided for in statute and, if so, how. The
                mother’s right to refuse registration by the father is already
                contained in the Births and Deaths Registration (Northern
                Ireland) Order 1976, and the Bill will not change this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Chairperson of the Finance and Personnel
                Committee, Mr&nbsp;Molloy made several points about procedure
                and asked which Committee would be best placed to consider the
                Bill. When the Assembly decides which Committee can best
                consider this legislation — whether it be an existing
                Committee or some other arrangement is made — I will support
                that choice. The Office of Law Reform is part of the Department
                of Finance and Personnel under statute and under the agreement.
                The Finance and Personnel Committee is there to advise and
                assist me as Minister, so I will consult with that Committee on
                any proposal for legislation within my ambit. I am open to
                suggestions from the Committee and the Assembly on where such a
                Bill might best be considered and on how best to take on board
                the insights and interests of other Committees. I am used to
                dealing with an increasing number of Committees these days, so
                one more would not be too much of a problem.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that no question will arise of the
                legislation’s being orphaned because, while several Committees
                have a degree of interest in it, none has sufficient interest to
                deal with it all. We must not get into a situation where it is
                difficult to get Committees to consider legislation which the
                Office of Law Reform believes important for the Assembly. As Mr
                Molloy and Prof McWilliams have pointed out, we all need to give
                more thought to how best the Assembly can consider these
                matters.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy also stressed the need to balance
                the human rights of children with those of parents. This Bill
                takes the rights of unmarried fathers and mothers and their
                children into account. What are the legally recognised rights
                and the legally presumed rights of unmarried fathers? In the
                agreement and in section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act,
                commitments and provisions were made to ensure equality of
                treatment, and one of the issues which confronts us is that of
                unmarried parents. We need to bear the equality principle in
                mind when deciding how to deal with some of these issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maginness noted that the legislation takes
                account of changing family relationships and referred to the
                many births which are jointly registered at present. Almost 64%
                of the births that take place outside marriage are jointly
                registered. Members may make their own assumptions about what
                that figure represents. Like Mr Maginness, Mr Dodds interprets
                it to mean that a large number of unmarried fathers want to take
                parental responsibility. It is probable that they believe that
                they are doing just that by jointly registering. They may not be
                aware that they need to take separate legal action to ensure
                that their responsibility and relationship are legally
                recognised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the existing provisions of the Children
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 an unmarried father may acquire
                responsibility for a child. Obviously we want to make this
                information readily available, understandable and accessible in
                our new legislation. People need to be made aware of these
                changes to understand the system which will apply in future and
                to understand that it does not have retrospective application.
                To this end, there will be an information campaign.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prof McWilliams raised a question on whether
                the power of the courts to terminate parental responsibility had
                been fully explored. Provision to terminate the recognition of
                parental responsibility already exists in statute and is not
                diminished by this legislation. Obviously, it will need
                application to the court.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prof McWilliams also asked about the motive
                behind the legislation, possibly because of other legislation
                that has come through, and whether the legislation was more to
                do with enabling particular payments than with anything else.
                The purpose of the legislation is to encourage and to facilitate
                unmarried fathers to have a full and legal relationship with
                their children, something that the vast majority of unmarried
                fathers and mothers wish to see.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prof McWilliams also made the important point
                that the Bill should not be seen in isolation but in the context
                of a much wider package of family law provisions and reforms. I
                want to join with Ms&nbsp;McWilliams in commending the work of
                the Office of Law Reform in keeping family law under constant
                review. The office has recently consulted on reforms to divorce
                law, to the physical punishment of children and to improvements
                in domestic violence legislation. I will bring any further
                reform measures to the Executive and Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill’s intention is to implement the
                considered outcome of the reforms that were put out to
                consultation in July&nbsp;1999. Other reforms may be
                forthcoming, but we can only bring forward those reforms that
                have been the subject of due consultation, especially as many
                Members have stressed the importance of public reflection.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nigel Dodds raised the issue of the rationale
                behind the statutory presumptions of paternity and what happens
                elsewhere. Other jurisdictions are considering some of the
                issues we are currently discussing. There are proposals in
                Scotland, England and Wales that joint registration of a child’s
                birth should confer parental responsibility on the unmarried
                father. The Republic requires that a child’s birth should be
                jointly registered before a court will issue a consent order
                providing for an unmarried father to be a child’s guardian.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Bill’s provisions are somewhat
                different. Clause 2 seeks to clarify the common law presumption
                about married fathers and recognise the de facto situation that
                a man registered as a child’s father is that child’s father.
                As Mr Dodds said, it is a tidying-up operation. Common law is
                increasingly being replaced by statute, which is more accessible
                and more easily understood. In relation to Mr Dodds’s
                question, Scotland already has those statutory presumptions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds also spoke about the definition of
                parental responsibility. The term &quot;parental
                responsibility&quot; is now understood by the courts. We perhaps
                need to be careful about defining the term more specifically in
                legislation, as that may be unduly restrictive. The current
                position allows for a degree of flexibility to cover the wide
                variety of circumstances in which it is required before the
                courts. I have already dealt with some of Mr&nbsp;Dodds’s
                other points.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr O’Hagan raised the question of violence
                against women and children and, in particular, registered the
                concern of some key interests that the provisions of the Bill
                may create some greater risks. I stress that minimising the risk
                of violence in family relationships is a major priority of mine
                with the development of family law. The Bill will not increase
                the risk of violence between partners or towards their children.
                An unmarried father or a step-parent’s parental responsibility
                can always be terminated by court order if it can be proved that
                it would be in the interest of a child to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The existing legislation on domestic
                violence, sponsored by the Department of Finance and Personnel
                through the work of the Office of Law Reform, is already
                recognised as one of the most progressive pieces of legislation
                of its kind. The operation of that legislation is currently
                under review to ensure that it affords all victims of domestic
                violence the protection they deserve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Guidance issued to schools, education and
                library boards and teachers’ unions by the Department of
                Education on 16 June 1999 set out the current law on parental
                responsibility and its implications for schools. The guidance
                deals with the position of unmarried fathers, on which my
                officials were consulted. Officials in the Office of Law Reform
                will liaise with colleagues in education about the need to issue
                fresh guidance once the Assembly has finalised the content of
                the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consultation paper on which the proposals
                are based was published in July 1999. It was sent to 185
                individuals and organisations representing local community and
                voluntary groups, health boards and trusts, churches, the legal
                profession, academics, men’s and women’s groups, the
                judiciary and all the main political parties in Northern
                Ireland. Thirty-four substantive responses were received from
                all the main bodies involved. These were well considered and
                generally supportive. However, some points of concern have been
                registered, and we want to ensure that they, as well as all
                other considerations, are fully reflected on as the Bill goes
                through its Assembly stages.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope I have covered all the points raised
                by Members. If not, I am sure I will be made aware of that
                shortly. Any outstanding points will be dealt with in writing in
                due course.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Mr Mallon): </b>The
                British-Irish Council (BIC), established under the Good Friday
                Agreement, is an important forum for exchanging information
                and consultation in endeavouring to agree on matters of mutual
                interest. It has the potential to benefit all the regions
                represented. To date, there has been one plenary meeting of the
                BIC and one sectoral meeting. The Council agreed a programme of
                work at the plenary meeting on 17 December 1999. It was decided
                that five areas of work would be taken forward in sectoral
                format. The Irish Government are leading on drugs, the Scottish
                Executive and the Cabinet of the National Assembly for Wales are
                jointly working on social inclusion, the Northern Ireland
                Executive will take the lead on transport, Jersey will lead on
                the knowledge economy and the British Government on the
                environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A sectoral meeting on the environment was
                held in London on 9 October 2000. The Minister of the
                Environment and the Minister of Education attended. Earlier
                today, the Minister of the Environment made a statement on the
                meeting, in which he informed the Assembly that the environment
                sectoral group discussed a wide range of future priority areas.
                In the next few months, that group will consider radioactive
                waste from Sellafield, the impact of climate change and waste
                management. It is anticipated that the next plenary meeting of
                the BIC will take place this month in Dublin and will focus on
                the issue of drugs.</p>

                comprehensive answer and trust that his worthy aspirations will
                soon be transposed into action. I hope that the frequency of the
                meetings will increase.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In view of the legacy of poor transport
                co-ordination between Northern Ireland and the rest of the
                United Kingdom resulting from direct rule, can the Deputy First
                Minister assure me that specific attention will be paid to
                improving transport links between Northern Ireland and Scotland
                and the north of England?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member raises an important point.
                Transport links with cities in Scotland, England and Wales are
                crucial for the people of Northern Ireland. This matter was
                raised at the first plenary meeting of the BIC. It was also
                raised at the first meeting of the British-Irish
                Intergovernmental Conference, and it will be deliberated upon
                further at future BIC meetings. I have no doubt that the
                Minister of the Environment will wish to take it forward.</p>

                the transport sectoral meeting will proceed within the BIC and

                Minister for Regional Development to fulfil his obligations?
                Failing that, will the First Minister or the Deputy First

                this issue forward in the absence of co-operation from the
                Minister responsible, the Minister for Regional Development. In

                sectoral meeting, the First Minister and I will be pressing the
                Minister for Regional Development to meet the responsibilities
                of his office, and we shall ourselves take responsibility for
                proceeding on this issue. An NSMC transport meeting has been

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Deputy First Minister agree that,
                given his previous response, it is somewhat hypocritical of the
                First Minister to have excluded IRA/Sinn Féin from meetings of
                the North/South Ministerial Council while at the same time
                finding their presence at the British-Irish Council acceptable?
                Is that not yet another example of a tame slap on the wrist for
                Sinn Féin, intended more to keep his party dissidents in line
                than to deal with the question of terrorists in Government?</p>

                recognises that the First Minster and I have a very good
                personal relationship and that, in any political process, there
                will be divergences of opinion. The strength of any such process
                is that those divergences are overcome. I can assure the

                ensure that the institutions with which we are involved, and for

                Government. As that document makes clear, the Executive are
                committed to greater accountability at regional level than in
                the past and will expect greater accountability from all
                services through a more efficient and effective structure of
                administration at local level. Officials are currently carrying
                out preparatory work on the review for the Executive, and it is
                planned that the terms of reference and organisation of the
                review will be further considered by the Executive later this

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is called a review of public
                administration and is, as such, intended to cover
                comprehensively all the bodies outside the Departments. The
                Member will recall that, as far back as December 1998, when we
                agreed on the departmental structure, we gave a commitment to
                examine the administrative structure outside the Departments and
                to do what we could to achieve greater efficiency and to balance
                some of the additional costs resulting from the enlarged central
                structure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consequently, we will be looking seriously
                — and hope the review will too — at a whole range of issues,
                including the various quangos. I am not saying that all quangos
                are bad. We will look critically to see what is necessary, what
                will contribute to greater efficiency and accountability and
                what can be done better elsewhere, which could result in a
                number of different answers. The review will look at those
                things. Currently, we are examining the scope of the review,
                which will be comprehensive, and making the arrangements. We

                back in December 1998 and has been consequently mentioned here
                several times. I recall answering questions on this subject in
                the Assembly. The pretended shock of the Member that a statement

                and the need to ensure that full account is taken of rural
                issues when developing major policies and programmes. Rural
                proofing is a concept that involves reviewing all major policies
                and programmes in a structured way to ensure that any rural
                dimension has been fully taken into account at the formulation
                stage. It is a commitment, in the draft Programme for
                Government, that all major policies and programmes will be rural
                proofed. The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development will
                take the lead on that issue and will establish a group to set
                out an overall approach to rural and countryside issues.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister will be aware that
                the First Minister has just recommended that my Friend read the
                ‘Belfast Telegraph’. I recommend that he read today’s ‘Belfast
                Telegraph’ article on the pig industry. The amazing and tragic
                figures show that, within three years, the number of farmers in
                the Province with pig herds has more than halved — falling
                from 2,207 to only 960. If this trend continues we will have no
                viable pig industry in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can he explain to the House — long before
                we have a report on the rural proofing that he is concerned
                about, and that I and my Committee are concerned about — what
                steps he can take now to step in and deal with this crisis?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a serious question about a serious
                issue. The Member will recognise that it is a matter to be dealt
                with specifically by the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development. He should look at, as I am sure he has looked at,
                the various measures, which I will not repeat ad infinitum, in
                relation to agriculture that are included in the Programme for
                Government.</p>

                which I will convey immediately to the Minister of Agriculture
                and Rural Development. I have no doubt that she will contact him
                in relation to that consultation.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the context of rural proofing, does the
                Minister share the farming community’s anxiety about flood
                damage and losses due to unharvested crops and the risk to
                livestock and households? Will Northern Ireland receive a share
                of the additional resources being promised by the British
                Government to combat the effects of flooding?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That question is particularly relevant at
                this time. Members will join with me in expressing sympathy for
                people in York and in various parts of England, Wales and the
                Republic of Ireland who are suffering dreadfully from flooding.
                I want to associate myself with the Member’s concern about our
                own farmers and the problems that they face, especially in
                relation to livestock and certain crops.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can assure the Member that Northern Ireland
                will receive its full Barnett share of the £51 million package
                announced by the Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott. That
                amount should be approximately £1·7 million. That aid package
                will be allocated over the coming years. Officials in the
                Department of Finance and Personnel will liaise with the
                Treasury on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development’s Rivers Agency, as the drainage and flood defence
                authority in Northern Ireland, already has 100 flood-alleviation
                projects at various stages of investigation and development. The
                Executive will keep a close eye on the issue, which has enormous
                implications not only for the farming community but throughout
                rural and urban Northern Ireland. We will do everything we
                possibly can to help those who unfortunately may be affected by
                it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his references to
                the urgency of rural proofing in Northern Ireland. Will he
                accept, however, that there are two major problems which arise
                from the Robson index of deprivation? First, it is significantly
                out of date. Secondly, particularly in rural areas, much poverty
                is hidden within more prosperous wards which does not appear in
                the index. Can the Minister give us an undertaking that those
                measures will be re-examined to ensure that we can rural proof
                properly in the future?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a question that we are all concerned
                about. It is tempting to think of poverty in terms of urban
                areas. All of us know that this type of poverty exists in rural
                areas. It is more a lace-curtain poverty than may be obvious in
                urban areas. The Robson indicators are being re-examined in the
                light of the circumstances that we face today. It is essential
                that we all recognise the isolation and deprivation that exist
                in rural areas. That is why it is so important that we have
                rural proofing in relation to every aspect of the
                Administration.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During direct rule, after receipt of Sir
                Kenneth Bloomfield’s report ‘We Will Remember Them’, the
                Northern Ireland Office set up the Victims Liaison Unit. After
                devolution, and in recognition of the fact that many of the
                issues faced by victims fell within the transferred field, a
                Victims Unit was set up in the Office of the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In broad terms, the Victims Unit within
                OFMDFM has responsibility for all transferred matters, with the
                NIO retaining responsibility for reserved matters. The Junior
                Ministers in OFMDFM have met with Adam Ingram to discuss the
                most appropriate division of responsibilities between the two
                units. They are due to meet again soon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Officials from both units are working closely
                together and endeavouring to ensure that the Northern Ireland
                Office and this Administration adopt a co-ordinated approach to
                meet victims’ needs.</p>

                am sure that he agrees that this sensitive area requires a
                focused and one-track approach, because I — like other
                Members, I am sure — have heard from individual victims and
                victims’ organisations that they are concerned about what is
                happening. They are unsure about the situation. I ask the First
                Minister to take that on board for future meetings.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the difficulties that have
                resulted from having two different groupings — one in the
                Northern Ireland Office and one in this Administration. That is
                necessary at present, because some of the issues that the
                Victims Liaison Unit deals with are clearly reserved matters,
                such as compensation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, this Administration has only
                recently established a Victims Unit. That is still developing,
                which is why we are currently engaged in discussions with the
                Northern Ireland Office. I refer the Member to the Programme for
                Government, which, I think, identifies six specific actions. We
                intend to develop a programme. We need to work with the Victims
                Liaison Unit, and we hope to make matters as user-friendly as
                possible for the various individuals and interests involved, but
                at present it is necessary for bifurcation.</p>

                the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister take into
                account the great hurt and concern of victims’ families and
                others in the community about the amount of public money given
                in recent years to the victims of violence as compared to the
                amounts given to perpetrators of violence, many of whom were
                released prematurely from prison at the behest of the First
                Minister, the Deputy First Minister and their supporters?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will he also accept that the contrast between
                cash given to terrorists and cash given to victims adds insult
                to the injury that was inflicted on families when they saw those
                who perpetrated crimes against their loved ones walking free,
                seemingly without any justice being meted out?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are, of course, keenly conscious of
                victims’ feelings and the need to ensure that victims’
                interests are not forgotten. That is why the Bloomfield Report
                was originally commissioned; that is why we are working on the
                matter. One difficulty is that, until recently, victims did not
                organise themselves in the way that other groups did. That has
                caused problems. There is also — I have to be frank — a
                problem caused by people who wish to exploit victims for
                political purposes. That is generally deprecated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to develop our own operation in order
                to ensure that proper concern is observed. I cannot go into the
                question of funding, because we are not responsible for any
                funding at present. The Victims Liaison Unit and the core
                funding scheme that it administers deal with current funding. I
                am not in a position to comment on that. Our own unit, which is
                now being established, has among its objectives the development
                and management of a specific measure under the Peace II
                programme. We will be happy to accept responsibility for the
                operation of that measure when it starts.</p>

                Given that the Bloomfield Report actually reinforced the notion
                of a hierarchy of victims in many ways, can the First and Deputy
                First Ministers ensure, or at least try to guarantee, that the
                Victims Unit will in no way agree with that notional hierarchy?
                Although Members have different views about victims, there is
                obviously a range of victims in our society. Can the First and
                the Deputy First Ministers assure us that they will work to
                ensure that the Victims Unit reaches out proactively to all

                comprehensive when dealing with, or trying to address, the
                problems of victims. The question is, what is the definition of
                a victim? An all-encompassing definition of a victim is
                extremely difficult to determine, particularly as there is an
                element of self-definition involved. The interdepartmental
                working group has adopted the following definition:</p>

                that we transfer the justice issue to Northern Ireland as soon
                as possible — consider a deadline for the closure of the

                reserved matters, victims do not? Does he also agree that the
                sooner Junior Ministers are clearly identified with a strategy

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development (Ms Rodgers):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said before, I welcomed the Agriculture
                and Rural Development Committee’s report as a balanced and
                pragmatic contribution to the debate on the difficulties
                currently facing the agrifood sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department already devotes considerable
                effort and resources to enable farmers and the wider agrifood
                industry to meet market demands and exploit new opportunities.
                An example of that is the ongoing comprehensive programme of
                educating and training farmers to develop their business
                management skills and meet customer demands. That involves
                working with farm businesses and producer groups to develop the
                competencies necessary to identify market trends and respond
                positively to them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development also assists, through grant aid and technical
                support, the development of new technologies, products and
                processes for use by all links in the food chain. Collaboration
                in the marketing of produce is encouraged by providing financial
                support through the marketing development scheme. Capital grant
                assistance to improve the competitiveness of the agrifood sector
                is also provided through the processing and marketing grant
                scheme. I can confirm that that work is being enhanced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My announcement earlier this year of the
                development of a farmers’ electronic portal — for which
                £240,000 has been provided this year, with a similar sum next
                year, coupled with associated enhanced IT facilities at the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development colleges —
                will help producers to take advantage of the opportunities that
                exist through information and communications technology, and
                e-commerce. The proposed additional funds of £1·4 million per
                annum that are to be allocated to support farm business
                development will also help in a practical way to enable primary
                producers to improve business performance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The £2 million per annum being allocated to
                the beef sector to improve beef quality will help primary
                producers better meet the demands of the market.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In view of what the Minister has said, and
                the reference to the many facilities available to make farming
                viable, does she consider that the adoption of a new attitude by
                the Department to treat farms as businesses and employ the
                services of other agencies, such as local enterprise development
                agencies with proper grant-aid and technology structures, would
                be useful to farmers in the transition between the farm gate and
                the market?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will she also consider the great difficulties
                that the farming community has with regard to diversification,
                particularly when farm incomes and farmers’ resources are at
                an all-time low? That transition is very difficult.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a corollary, will the Minister make
                herself aware of the consequences of farmers leaving the land or
                diversifying? Who will then be custodian of our agricultural
                heritage and countryside?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with many of the issues that Mr
                McGrady has raised. My answer addressed many of those issues
                with regard to helping farms progress as businesses. The
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development enables farmers
                to treat their farms as businesses and to increase their
                competitiveness in the market.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member raised the issue of treating farms
                as small businesses for grant purposes, and many farmers have
                posed that question. For example, LEDU grants are available for
                start-up businesses, but the farming community sometimes feels
                that it is not entitled to them. The LEDU remit does not cover
                primary production. However, LEDU would consider issuing grants
                to farmers who wish to establish processing businesses and other
                businesses which fall under the diversification category. I
                encourage farmers to apply for this assistance, and I hope that
                LEDU will respond because farmers feel hard done by. It is
                possible to get access to those grants for certain businesses
                under diversification.</p>

                at all the links in the food marketing chain, as well as the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the
                Department of the Environment. In my reply to the Committee, I
                was pleased to confirm that in most cases the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development is already developing a range
                of initiatives aimed at addressing the underlying issues and
                concerns. Some of the proposals were for the industry and not
                the Department to develop. Some proposals would involve EU
                state-aid rules in which my Department would not be allowed to
                intervene. However, I am developing all the proposals that are
                within my powers, and I have already outlined some of them to
                the Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr&nbsp;Paisley mentioned the pig industry. I
                am aware of the difficulties there. I also share the Member’s

                attempt to gain permission to restructure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several questions have been raised, and as
                soon as we responded to them other questions were sent to us. It
                has been a slow process. I raised the issue with
                Nick&nbsp;Brown, who wrote to Commissioner&nbsp;Fischler. I
                raised it again at the previous meeting of regional Ministers,
                and Nick Brown wrote to assure me that he personally had raised
                the matter with Commissioner&nbsp;Fischler. I await a response,
                but I have done everything in my power to ensure that we proceed
                as quickly as possible with the restructuring of the pig
                industry.</p>

                the Department is starting to exceed the sector’s revenue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure the Minister will agree that we
                cannot eat a book of regulations, no matter how attractive the
                wrapper. Yet we have book-loads of regulations that prescribe
                much of our own produce as not fit for sale unless it passes an
                expensive panoply of health and hygiene tests. On the very same
                supermarket shelves, consumers can buy imported foodstuffs that
                have not been subject to anything like the same degree of
                scrutiny. How does the Minister propose to level this most
                unfairly tilted playing field?</p>

                the regulations, particularly those that relate to welfare. The
                issue was raised at a recent cross- departmental meeting of
                Ministers in London. It was agreed that it would be brought
                forward to the World Trade Organisation discussions with a view

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very pleased that the plan has now been
                approved. Negotiations were protracted and difficult,
                particularly in relation to the changeover from the old headage-based
                hill livestock compensation allowance (HLCA) scheme to the new
                area-based less-favoured area (LFA) support scheme. We have
                achieved a very positive outcome with increased resources and a
                safety net in the first three years of the new LFA scheme. I was
                able to secure substantial additional funding for the LFA scheme
                from the Treasury worth £32 million over its first four years
                of operation. That means that the financing of support for hill
                farmers is now more secure than it has been for several years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, the safety-net arrangements will
                minimise the losses to those farmers who will see a reduction in
                their level of payment. As well as the new LFA scheme, the plan
                also provides for a significant increase in the uptake of
                agrienvironment schemes and allows for a continuation of the
                forestry measures, which opens up new opportunities for farmers
                under those programmes. Overall, the plan is worth £266 million
                to Northern Ireland agriculture from 2000 to 2006.</p>

                Northern Ireland rural development plan has come later than that
                for England and Wales, I welcome the fact that it has now been
                approved by the EU Committee on Structures and Rural Development
                (STAR). Perhaps the Minister would indicate when she expects
                full Commission approval. She will be aware of Commissioner
                Fischler’s recent commitment to greater transparency in farm
                policy. Will she give a similar commitment to greater

                reinforced by a requirement for a minimum stocking of 0·2
                livestock units per hectare, which will guard against the
                problem of under-grazing. To counter over-grazing, all farms
                with stocking densities above 1·8 livestock units per hectare
                will be inspected to ensure that they are being farmed
                responsibly. In addition to the provisions in the LFA scheme,
                the separate agrienvironment measures in the plan will provide

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recently announced the strategic study into

                market opportunities for producers of organic goods. I wish to
                encourage the development of a vibrant organic sector in
                Northern Ireland. It is important that it should be developed
                strategically, and I thought that a study would be the best way
                to take things forward. In making my decision, I was guided by
                the valuable work and recommendations of the organic farming
                liaison group, which draws its membership from the organic
                sector and the farming unions, as well as officials from the
                Department. In the organic sector, market demand is ahead of
                supply and we should be homing in on the opportunities that it
                presents.</p>

                agreement — is considered to be close to its optimum uptake.
                It is anticipated in the rural development regulation plan that,
                by 2006, the organic farming scheme will grow from its present
                level of 20 farmers, with 1,000 hectares under agreement, to
                1,000 farmers, with 30,000 hectares. The countryside management
                scheme, which will have its first entrants later this year, will
                have 4,000 participant farmers, with 150,000 hectares under

                As Mr Armstrong has already mentioned, the EU Commission
                approved the rural development plan on 24 October. The statutory
                rules necessary to bring those schemes into effect are currently
                the subject of consultation with the agriculture industry and
                will shortly come before the Committee for scrutiny. On
                completion of those necessary steps, the legislation will be
                brought forward as soon as possible, and I am anxious to be able
                to open the schemes.</p>

                with her and her officials on this issue. There is genuine
                concern. We have never had this problem, and we certainly do not
                want the possibility of there being a problem added to BSE and
                the many other problems within the farming industry. Can the
                Minister assure me that not only is the onus on the country of
                origin but that she and her Department take the matter very
                seriously? Any brown rot coming into this country could wipe out
                another part of our vital farming industry at this perilous
                time.</p>

                scientists in the Department as recently as last week. I am
                aware of it as an issue. I am aware of the difficulties it would
                create. As far as anyone can humanly guarantee anything, we
                cannot rule out the possibility. For that reason, all the
                precautions I have outlined, both those assured by the Scottish
                Executive and those that we are doing ourselves, are being taken

                among farmers is that they may not be, and, if there is only
                limited testing here, that opens a door. No one can tell what

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following the Forestry Service’s
                establishment as an agency, the chief executive invited
                consultants to look at its organisation, staffing and systems
                and to recommend options for improving efficiency and
                effectiveness. The outcome was major changes to the structure of
                the Forestry Service. Most significant has been the
                reorganisation of the work into three directorates —
                operations, policy and standards, and corporate services. The
                most radical changes were in the operations directorate, where a
                redrawing of district boundaries created three larger districts.
                Working practices were restructured, and responsibility for
                forestry grants was transferred to the policy and standards
                directorate. Previously the Forestry Service operated in five
                geographical districts — Ballymena, Castlewellan, Enniskillen,
                Limavady and Omagh, each serviced by a district office. The
                three new districts — east, west and north — created by the
                redrawing of district boundaries have offices at Castlewellan,
                Enniskillen and Limavady. The Limavady office will shortly move

                We are addressing the issue by looking at a review of community

                growing et&nbsp;cetera. Such a review will inform us of how best
                to treat the sector as part of the overall arts infrastructure.
                Although there may be debates and arguments between the Arts

                and the Arts Council, in common with all bodies and
                non-departmental bodies, has its own equality scheme as well as
                requirements under, for example, New TSN. Those are requirements
                that the Arts Council must meet. Each application will be
                treated on its merits, what it will deliver and what its outputs
                will be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A review of community arts will perform an
                important task in informing the Arts Council where those

                talking about a multicultural society in Northern Ireland,
                bearing in mind that there are sizeable ethnic minorities and

                review recommended that the Arts Council should consider
                delegating responsibility for community arts to district
                councils, and that is reflected in the Arts Council’s strategy
                of opening up the arts. There is equity of treatment and there
                is one community. Matters are dealt with on their merits, and
                that is the proper way to go forward with respect to the
                equality scheme that the Arts Council has adopted.</p>

                It will also allow smaller adaptation grant schemes to be

                hand of any specific proposals for those who suffer physical

                those venues more accessible. It may be that provision can be
                made for a small adaptation grant scheme. Large sums of money
                are not necessarily required. Very small amounts of money can
                often make such venues accessible. I cannot be any more specific
                at this point, but I will write to Mr Hussey about it. If Mr

                years and still the second-largest council area in Northern
                Ireland is being deprived of library services. If the private
                finance initiative does not work out, what will the Minister do
                to ensure adequate library provision in Lisburn?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr Poots when he refers to 25
                years — Lisburn waited during the 25 barren years of direct
                rule, and the shortages and underfunding in much Government
                activity mean that the Library Service is no exception. Several
                towns have, like Lisburn, awaited provision for some time.
                During the spending review, SR2000, I secured an extra £0·5
                million for capital library funding. Lisburn library itself will
                cost approximately £3·5&nbsp;million. Clearly the extra
                funding, added to the £1·3 million we are already getting,
                does not begin to address the need. Work is underway in
                Portadown, and plans for Strabane have also been announced, but
                we do not have enough resources. I continue to ask for the
                sympathy of the Executive Committee, but until the money is
                allocated to my Department I cannot provide capital funding for
                libraries.</p>

                deprived of adequate library facilities for a quarter of a
                century? Rather than stating that he is exploring possibilities,
                the Minister should know that the people of Lisburn are
                demanding that, through devolved Government, the necessary
                finances be made available to provide a library, sooner rather
                than later. Although we recognise the other areas’
                difficulties, the fact of Lisburn borough’s inadequate library
                facilities prevails.</p>

                is a private finance initiative going forward to provide a new
                library for Lisburn. Lisburn Borough Council and the South
                Eastern Education and Library Board share Mr Close’s and Mr
                Poots’s recognition of this need, and they are considering
                providing the library through that mechanism. If that does not
                work, we will have to look at other ways, but we hope that
                Lisburn will get a new library through the private funding
                initiative.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close must understand that after
                25&nbsp;years we will not be able to address all the funding
                shortfalls in year one or in session one. The project will take
                many years. I agree that Lisburn is a key borough, and although
                I may not agree with his words &quot;a scandal of monumental
                proportions&quot;, I accept that there is a glaring need for

                Enterprise, Trade and Investment to examine and review the
                electricity supply market in this region.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Three weeks ago the Executive presented a
                draft Programme for Government to Members of the Assembly. It
                stated that its overriding purpose was to make a difference to
                the lives of the people of Northern Ireland. That is to be
                achieved by the Executive and the Assembly’s working together
                and listening to the interests of business and all the social
                partners to implement an imaginative legislative framework that
                could create opportunities for everyone in society. If the
                Executive and Assembly are serious about the task in hand, we
                must make a start and deal with policies inherited from direct
                rule, and whose effect is to hold us back from creating the sort
                of inclusive society and competitive economy that is at the
                heart of the draft Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The privatisation of Northern Ireland’s
                electricity network is one such hangover from direct rule. Over
                the last seven years it has put industrial, commercial and
                domestic users at an unfair disadvantage. I will draw the House’s
                attention to some statistics that graphically show the extent of
                Northern Ireland’s disadvantage when compared with the price
                of electricity in Britain, the Irish Republic and the rest of
                Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, at the start of 1999 the typical
                domestic user in Northern Ireland paid 9·43p per unit, while in
                Germany the average domestic consumer paid 11·8% less, at
                8·31p per unit, and in the Netherlands 32·5% less, at 6·36p
                per unit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The comparisons with the rest of the UK and
                Ireland are equally telling. Northern Ireland’s domestic price
                per unit is 21% above that of Scotland, 27% above those of
                England and Wales, and 53% above that of the Irish Republic.
                This year domestic customers in Northern Ireland will pay around
                £305, whereas the average bill in Britain is £257.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recent welcome liberalisation of the
                market in line with EU Directives will by 2003 allow around 420
                of the largest commercial users to buy electricity from other
                companies such as the Electricity Supply Board (ESB). Despite
                that, the smaller small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are,
                and will remain, similarly disadvantaged. Taking an average
                industrial user with a maximum demand of 500 kilowatts at a 40%
                load factor, the price per unit is 14% above that of Scotland,
                38% above those of England and Wales, and 75% above that of the
                Irish Republic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the introduction of the climate change
                levy in 2001, the cost of electricity to industrial users is
                scheduled to increase by another 5%. It is important, therefore,
                that we address the problem of high electricity prices in
                Northern Ireland now. The statistics reveal the extraordinary
                disparity in electricity prices in the North of Ireland,
                Britain, the Republic and the rest of Europe. The public has
                entrusted the Assembly with the good governance of the region.
                It is only right that we should ask why consumers in Northern
                Ireland pay more than consumers anywhere else in western Europe
                for this essential resource. The reasons are complex, and
                concern the structure of the industry and the way in which it
                was privatised; the refusal of Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE)
                to abide by the price controls of the regulator, the Office for
                the Regulator of Electricity and Gas (OFREG); the lack of
                interest from the British Government; and, until devolution and
                the draft Programme for Government, a total absence of any
                coherent policy direction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To understand why the consumer is getting
                such an unfair deal, we must look back to 1992-93 when the
                industry was privatised. Whether we agree or disagree for
                ideological reasons with the policy of privatisation, it has
                been stated that the previous Conservative Government, in the
                words of Adam Ingram, botched up the privatisation of Northern
                Ireland’s electricity. It was rushed through. The two main
                power stations, Kilroot and Ballylumford, bought overpriced and
                uneconomic long-term contracts. They were paid £320 million —
                almost twice as much as they were worth — for such
                low-efficiency levels of production.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The two main components of those contracts
                were the guaranteed fuel payments, in which the customer paid
                for the cost of fuel burnt through NIE, and the availability
                payments, through which the generators received payment for the
                time they were available, whether or not they produced output.
                That is like paying a taxi company for having taxis available
                and paying for the taxi again when it does a run. The
                availability of the generators increased from 70% before
                privatisation to over 90% in some instances after privatisation
                — a higher fixed cost to the consumer. The availability of
                payments accounts for almost 50% of the total generation costs,
                a figure considered by OFREG and the Northern Ireland Consumer
                Committee for Electricity as excessively high. At around 80%,
                generation costs account for the largest proportion of the bill
                for industrial users, and the proportion is 60% for domestic
                users.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After some resistance from NIE, the
                Coolkeeragh and Ballylumford contracts have been reconstructed,
                which has reduced the cost to customers to a certain extent.
                Work on the new combined cycle gas turbine plant at Ballylumford
                will lead to increased efficiency levels and a further reduction
                in costs. However, it is disturbing that NIE insisted that the
                capital expenditure should be written off over a period of 10
                years instead of the normal 20, which would have brought greater
                savings to customers. In my opinion, plant like that could be
                written off over 30 years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, the Kilroot contract is in need
                of renegotiation, but to date nothing has been done. The
                restructuring of the Kilroot contract, according to the Northern
                Ireland Consumer Committee, would bring the greatest savings to
                customers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it would be mistaken for this House
                to focus all its attention on the generators. In a consultation
                paper published by OFREG in April, the charges relating to the
                transmission and distribution of electricity represented the
                largest single component of the cost of electricity after
                generation, and accounted for 30% of the final electricity bill.
                Transmission and distribution costs are the most profitable part
                of the business for NIE and its holding company, Viridian. This
                has important consequences for domestic users in particular, as
                the transmission and distribution component is, as OFREG has
                stated, inversely related to consumption. Therefore the
                transmission and distribution costs for domestic consumers
                represent 40% of the bill, whereas for large industrial
                consumers they are less than 15% of the bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this juncture it is interesting to compare
                the costs of transmission and distribution with those in
                Britain. According to OFREG, at the time of privatisation,
                transmission and distribution costs were around the GB average
                for the average customer. Although overall transmission and
                distribution costs are expected to be higher in Northern Ireland
                than in Britain because of the lower level of electricity
                production, over the last 10 years they have shown an increasing
                divergence. We have not benefited as much from privatisation as
                consumers in Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This year, transmission and distribution
                costs will be around 57% higher than those in Britain. OFREG
                predicts that that divergence will continue, despite the growth
                in demand in Northern Ireland that should have reduced costs.
                Transmission and distribution costs in Northern Ireland are set
                to rise, and by 2001 this divergence will be close to 60%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One cannot get away from the fact that
                transmission and distribution costs are a major factor in the
                high price of electricity in Northern Ireland. In its April 2000
                consultation paper, OFREG says that it is worth taking into
                consideration that since privatisation, had transmission and
                distribution costs reflected those in Britain, consumers could
                have saved an estimated £200 million, and around £40 million
                in the year 2000 alone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If it is to fulfil the mandate given to it by
                the electorate and make a real effort to deliver social justice
                for all sections of our community, then the Assembly must
                address this serious issue. There is no justifiable reason why
                NIE’s transmission and distribution costs should be so much
                higher than those of comparable regional electricity companies
                in Britain. As OFREG says, NIE is unique in that it is the only
                electricity company not to have a price control set by the
                regulator. The regulator, unfortunately, has no teeth in
                Northern Ireland. The first price control was set by the
                Government in 1992-93, and ran until 1996-97. It allowed NIE to
                raise revenue by 3·5% above the rate of inflation, and its
                transmission and distribution prices by 1% annually above the
                rate of inflation. According to OFREG, that gave NIE £301
                million to invest in improving the network. One third of that
                money was not used for network investment, but for the benefit
                of shareholders. Consumers experienced the consequences of this
                during the storms of Christmas 1998, when many had to go without
                electricity for days.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1996, NIE rejected the second price
                control set by the regulator. The case was referred to the
                Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC). In the end, a
                compromise was agreed. However, it did not adequately deal with
                the problem of high transmission and distribution costs.
                Unfortunately, customers have also paid for the capital
                underspend, as NIE was allowed to claw back an additional £25
                million from customers in what the MMC referred to as
                &quot;underpaid depreciation charges&quot;. The customer paid
                twice. That is staggering when one considers NIE’s &quot;super
                profits&quot; since privatisation and the dividends paid to
                shareholders, which have surely and steadily increased.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been estimated that Northern Ireland’s
                total electricity bill between 1992-93 and the current year was
                £3·8&nbsp;billion before tax. Fifteen per cent of this figure
                (£573&nbsp;million) represented NIE’s share of the profit,
                and 7 per cent (£267&nbsp;million) of this sum was the
                generators’ profit. NIE also made healthy returns for its
                shareholders. In 1993 the dividend was 10p per share, rising to
                25.3p per share in 1999. NIE’s transmission and distribution
                asset base also increased considerably, from £402 million in
                1993 to approximately £520 million in 1999. Of course, it must
                be acknowledged that since 1997, particularly after the 1998
                Christmas storms, NIE has made amends by making significant
                improvements to the network, thus fulfilling their capital
                expenditure requirements. It has also invested in new customer
                communication systems.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another welcome development came in April of
                this year when NIE agreed to a price control for the supply
                component of its business, which is responsible for billing,
                meter reading and customer advice. This accounts for only 5% of
                the average bill and will save customers about £16&nbsp;million
                between now and 2005. However, it remains to be seen whether NIE
                will accept the regulator’s price recommendations where they
                really count — the transmission and distribution costs where
                NIE makes about 80% of its profits — before the third price
                control is due to come into effect in 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Devolution provides the Assembly with the
                opportunity to develop policies tailored to meet the needs of
                the people of Northern Ireland. If we are to have the confidence
                to implement and benefit from an all-Ireland, and indeed, a
                Europe-wide energy market as laid out in the draft Programme for
                Government, the Minister and his Department must seize the
                initiative, strike a fair balance between the interests of
                shareholders and consumers and end this electricity surcharge.
                The Minister and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment need to provide a clear policy framework to enable
                the electricity regulator to do his job without hindrance and to
                represent the interests of the consumer effectively. In this
                private monopoly situation, NIE are the price makers, and we the
                consumers are the price takers. Therefore it is imperative that
                the regulator be allowed to do his job.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been estimated that if Northern
                Ireland’s electricity prices had tracked those in Britain
                following privatisation, the consumer would be much better off
                overall. I tabled this motion because world energy and fuel
                prices are rising, and I have been led to believe that NIE are
                currently considering increasing consumers’ electricity bills
                by about 9%. Also, there will be a 5% increase in April due to
                the climate change levy. It is imperative that this issue be
                addressed now.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the number of Members who wish to
                speak, and that interruption must come and the Question be put
                no later than six o’clock, I have no option but to restrict
                the time for speeches. Therefore I ask Members to limit
                themselves to six&nbsp;minutes each, with no longer than
                10&nbsp;minutes for the moving and winding-up speeches. There is
                also an amendment to be considered, and 15&nbsp;minutes has been
                set aside for the Minister to respond at the end of the debate,
                before the winding-up speeches.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move the following amendment: After
                &quot;electricity supply market&quot; insert &quot;and
                distribution system&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The electricity industry in Northern Ireland
                was privatised in the early 1990s, and concerns have been raised
                about aspects of that privatisation. European Directives
                governing the electricity internal market have been issued since
                then as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given this background, I agree with Mr Byrne
                that there is a need to review the electricity supply market in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I start by commending the work of the
                electricity regulator in Northern Ireland, who has done a lot of
                work in highlighting failings in the current system and in
                trying to act on behalf of the consumer. I commend also the
                Northern Ireland Consumer Committee for Electricity for its
                timely briefing, which, no doubt, we have all received, and
                which contains some useful content for this time of the year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of my amendment is to clarify the
                motion and ensure that any review would cover the electricity
                distribution system in Northern Ireland. What I understand to be
                the electricity supply market is a relatively new arrangement,
                which has resulted in the largest electricity consumers,
                currently 32% of demand, being able to trade directly with
                independent generators. This has introduced a degree of
                competition between generators.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there is also a need to review the
                electricity distribution system in Northern Ireland. I welcome
                the fact that when moving the motion my Colleague used a much
                wider interpretation, and I commend him for doing so. I hope
                that the Minister will take on board that he is not speaking
                with a narrow focus, but on a much wider range of costs that
                impinge on the electricity supply industry in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to OFREG, input into the 1998-99
                transmission represents 39% of all costs to a typical domestic
                consumer. That is a very significant proportion. Also, the
                Northern Ireland Consumer Committee for Electricity has
                highlighted the fact that there is a growing divergence between
                the cost of electricity transmission and distribution of
                electricity by NIE and that incurred by companies in Great
                Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For domestic consumers, the cost of
                transmission and distribution in Northern Ireland this year will
                be about 57% higher than for customers in England and Wales. The
                estimated cost by the end of the current control period will be
                about 2p per unit of electricity in Northern Ireland, compared
                to about 1·3p in Great Britain. This additional cost must be
                borne by the consumers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Consumer Committee has
                highlighted that if, since privatisation, we had maintained
                parity with England and Wales, electricity consumers in Northern
                Ireland would have saved £200 million. We are talking about
                very substantial sums of money on the transmission side.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although we are unlikely to match the
                transmission costs of England and Wales because Northern Ireland
                is of a more rural nature, there is still real cause for concern
                over the degree of divergence that has occurred. I will outline
                my areas of concern with the past distribution system and also
                on future possible conflicts of interests, and I hope that I
                will demonstrate that there is a clear need for a review of the
                distribution system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1999, the director-general of OFREG in
                Northern Ireland advised that NIE had been allocated £301
                million between 1993 and 1997 for capital expenditure but only
                spent £204 million on the distribution system. The net benefit
                was an additional £14 million profit to NIE shareholders. It is
                clear that this should not be allowed. If money has been
                allocated for upgrading the system, it should have been spent on
                that. It should not have ended up benefiting NIE shareholders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, there have been dramatic changes
                since a winter storm caused huge disruption to the transmission
                system in Northern Ireland. I hope that this underspend will be
                unlikely to occur in the future, but, nevertheless, it should
                never have been allowed to occur in the first place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will touch on NIE profits. According to
                Viridian’s annual report for 1999-00, NIE made a profit of
                £64·9 million in the transmission and distribution of
                electricity, with a turnover of £500 million. It is in a
                monopoly position, and the conditions in which it operates have
                enabled it to be one of the most profitable Northern Ireland
                companies. But what huge technological risks has it taken? How
                can it justify such high profits? What huge improvements has it
                brought to the system?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NIE is a monopoly distributor. It has a safe
                number of consumers and a captive market. According to business
                analysis, NIE investors have had a 28% return per annum. Its
                share prices have increased by 20% per annum, and a dividend of
                approximately 8% per annum is payable to them. It has been a
                very healthy business for NIE and its shareholders — at the
                expense of Northern Ireland’s consumers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is in the past, but NIE’s parent
                company, Viridian, has diversified into other interests. As I
                have said, NIE is a monopoly distributor in Northern Ireland and
                has access to details of the demand of all electricity users in
                Northern Ireland. That is potentially sensitive information.
                Viridian Power Resources, NIE’s sister company, has decided to
                generate electricity at Huntstown combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT)
                station in the Irish Republic, so there is clear potential for a
                conflict of interests. Any review of the Northern Ireland
                distribution system must clearly address this. There must not be
                any conflict of interests with a monopoly provider of
                electricity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Considering today’s announcement that there
                is going to be a 9% increase in electricity prices in Northern
                Ireland, the need for a review of the electricity supply market
                and of the distribution system becomes more urgent. I urge
                everybody to support my amendment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all agree that electricity prices in
                Northern Ireland are too high, and the consumer falls for it
                every time. That is the real issue. Perhaps the Members who
                moved the motion and proposed the amendment can come together on
                the thrust of the issue and find accommodation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This issue hits the pocket of every household
                in Northern Ireland, and it is a topic very much in the public
                domain. Consumers in Northern Ireland face stiff charges for
                electricity. They are forking out about £2 million more than
                the United Kingdom weekly average for their light and power. We
                have already heard the statistics. To put it into perspective,
                it is £3·10 extra for each household in Northern Ireland each
                week. Over a year, that adds up to a substantial amount.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it any wonder that consumers are
                considering alternative methods of power and heating? Is it any
                wonder that gas is making inroads in the Greater Belfast area?
                Phoenix Gas is an alternative method that is available in my
                borough. Many people are considering that option because the
                prices are much lower. People are constrained and focused upon
                the price and the bills that they have to pay.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people who suffer most from the price
                increases are those who can least afford them — the elderly,
                single parents and families on low income. Very often they are
                also the people who use the most electricity. The result is that
                many are facing the stark choice that the elderly have to face
                every year — purchase food or heat the house. They have to
                choose whether to buy food for the children, put extra coal on
                the fire, or turn the electric up. How do you make those
                decisions? The decisions are dictated by your purse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As winter approaches, so does the possibility
                of confronting a subject that many try to avoid — hypothermia.
                Many senior citizens face this problem every day of the winter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Figures show that consumers in Northern
                Ireland are charged much more for electricity than are all our
                European neighbours. The figures are in front of us. I had made
                arrangements to get the figures, but the information that we
                received in the post today indicates a real difference. We are
                paying approximately two and a half times the sum our European
                neighbours pay. Northern Ireland consumers also pay more than
                the average prices in England, Wales and Scotland. Why do we pay
                a whopping 9·43p per kilowatt? That is the question we are all
                asking.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps one way of alleviating the price
                difference is to be more energy efficient, but I know that NIE
                has tried to do that. Those are things that we can do. At a fuel
                poverty show in the Long Gallery we saw people’s ideas on
                energy efficiency. NIE could spend more and make more money
                available, through loft insulation, hot water tank insulation or
                whatever. Those measures would help, but they would only
                partially address the issue. If the cost of electricity is still
                above the national average, the problem of price is still
                crucial. Full domestic competition is available on the mainland,
                but not in the Province — only 26% of the market is available
                and open. There is little chance of our having an alternative
                supply from another electricity company, because the source has
                to come through NIE. That concerns us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been much discussion about a
                two-tier tariff system. That could also address some of our
                problems. If there were a lower charge for essential power and
                then a higher charge for non-essential power, as in England,
                that could create an incentive for customers to use their
                electricity more wisely. In England consumers have not been
                disadvantaged. NIE should carefully consider that plan. Two
                thirds of Northern&nbsp;Ireland customers could benefit from
                such a proposal, and the cost gap could fall from
                £25&nbsp;million to £9&nbsp;million. That is a significant
                differential.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have been told that there may be some
                electricity coming in from Scotland. That may bring the price
                down. We are also aware of the possibility that the Republic of
                Ireland may supply electricity to Northern&nbsp;Ireland. A
                substantial and significant reduction could be made through
                those measures. At the same time there has to be a commitment
                from NIE to make the system work. At present, many customers —
                who are also our constituents — suspect that NIE could do more
                but is constrained by its shareholders. There is an onus on NIE
                to be more proactive in convincing customers that its primary
                concern is to supply a satisfactory service at a reasonable and
                equitable price.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr O’Hagan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The
                motion is very timely — it has just been announced in the
                media that there will be another price hike — but it does not
                go far enough. We need to be radical, innovative and imaginative
                on the whole issue of energy, not just electricity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, we need to look at an all-Ireland
                electricity supply. It is illogical for a small country like
                Ireland, with a population of less than half that of many
                European cities, to have two electricity systems. That has
                resulted in gross inefficiency and the disparity in costs that
                we have today. An all-Ireland energy strategy makes sound
                economic and strategic sense. We should also examine the
                expansion of natural gas networks. At present, the networks on
                the island of Ireland are clustered on the east coast, to the
                detriment of people in the west. That does not create a level
                economic playing field. It is grossly inefficient that only some
                of the population benefit from alternative energy resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also need to open up the potential for
                renewable energy resources — wind and wave power would be the
                most suitable. It is not an exaggeration to say that Ireland
                could export electricity if we harnessed it in that way. Not
                only would it make sound economic sense to use renewable energy
                resources in the long term, but it would also have a beneficial
                environmental impact. For example, Governments now have to
                adhere to the Kyoto protocol. It will also remove our reliance
                on fossil fuels. At present, NIE’s ECO tariff is more
                expensive to use. NIE should make a firm commitment to
                eco-energy and the ECO tariff should be cheaper to use.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was instructed by my party to propose to
                the Assembly Commission the use of wind turbines on the Stormont
                estate. The estate is the responsibility of the Department of
                Finance and Personnel, and the proposal is going through the
                Finance and Personnel Committee. I hope that the Department will
                look favourably on this option. However, there is no reason why,
                in the short term, the Assembly cannot transfer to the ECO
                tariff. By doing this, we would be demonstrating a political
                commitment to eco-energy, and we would be setting an example in
                this field.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support this motion. However, it does not
                go far enough, though it is good that these issues are being
                aired. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and the amendment, but
                there is a certain air of unreality about this debate. As we
                debate the issue, NIE stands poised to increase substantially
                the cost to the consumers. It has been suggested that the
                increase will be by between 9% and 10% and it will cite the very
                high cost of fuel, particularly oil, as its justification for
                this. However, Coolkeeragh power station is the only station
                that burns oil to generate electricity nowadays. While Kilroot
                has the capacity to burn oil, it burns coal, and Ballylumford
                uses natural gas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This issue of electricity energy costs has
                been ongoing for many years. In the 1970s there was
                over-dependence on the use of oil for electricity generation,
                and some changes were made as a result of putting too many eggs
                in the one basket. The real problem to be addressed nowadays is
                the absolute mess that was made of the privatisation of Northern
                Ireland Electricity. Not only were long-term contracts provided
                that were not in the interests of the consumer but, as I said at
                the time, the Northern Ireland electricity market was too small
                and there was no competition. That has brought about many of the
                problems that we face today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NIE needs to scrap all its contracts with the
                generators. It should go back to the drawing board and develop
                contracts which will provide electricity prices in line with the
                total operational costs. As Mr&nbsp;Byrne pointed out, the
                overly high cost of transmission and distribution of electricity
                in Northern Ireland is one of the major factors that contributes
                to high consumer costs. I also agree with Dr&nbsp;O’Hagan’s
                suggestion that we look not just at electricity, but at natural
                gas and other forms of energy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that people have come to accept that
                if we are to provide an energy distribution facility for the
                people in Northern Ireland, it must not just be provided on an
                all-island basis. While the introduction of the new Moyle
                interconnector has been opposed for environmental reasons, we
                must accept that we are now becoming part of a UK-based energy
                distribution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Enterprise, Trade and Investment
                Committee has been considering a number of energy issues and
                will continue to do that. We have worked hard on the proposed
                natural gas pipeline to the north-west, where Coolkeeragh would
                be the anchor tenant, so to speak, and would generate
                electricity through a combined cycle gas turbine.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week, I joined the Minister and Mr Beggs
                for the cutting of the first sod for the new power station at
                Ballylumford. It is important to create a level playing field,
                but I am irked by the suggestions coming from the Republic’s
                Government that there should be a levy on the gas flowing along
                the North/South gas pipeline, which will obviously provide
                resources for a new power station north of Dublin. The Republic
                of Ireland’s Government are doing us no favours, and the
                Committee recently decided to approach them to ensure that the
                levy is not imposed. Such a levy could have a wide-ranging
                negative impact on the development of energy provision in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the Assembly’s main aims is to
                increase investment in Northern Ireland. We will have energy
                prices that are substantially higher than those in other parts
                of the UK and in the Republic of Ireland, but it is vitally
                important that we develop prices that can attract the necessary
                investment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I echo the praise for the work of
                the regulator.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened with interest to Members’
                contributions. It was a shock to learn that electricity prices
                could rise by a further 9% in the coming months — by January,
                perhaps. I call that electric shock treatment. Do NIE’s
                decision-makers have no understanding of the difficulties faced
                by their customers? I think particularly of those who cannot
                afford to heat their homes at present prices and are about to be
                hit with a further increase. I do not know whether the increase
                will take effect slap-bang in the middle of winter or at the
                end, but I know that it shows an incredible lack of sensitivity
                and understanding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NIE claims that the rising price in Northern
                Ireland is a reflection of rising world energy prices. Why are
                NIE shareholders shielded from the rise, when NIE customers are
                forced to bear the brunt? I understand that profits of between
                £65 million and £70 million were made last year. In a normal
                market, if suppliers put prices up too high they price
                themselves out of the market and people go elsewhere. In this
                case that cannot happen because there is a monopoly on
                distribution, or at least on all but 32% of supply. Prices go up
                and up, and consumers can do nothing about it.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But we can do something about it. That is why
                we are debating this issue today. Let us take this opportunity
                to show the people of Northern Ireland that, as their
                representatives, working together, we can do something for them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So, what can we do? First, we can call on the
                Minister to review the energy supply and distribution market, as
                proposed in the motion and the amendment. We can, as Mr Byrne
                said, find a system to ensure that price controls are properly
                exercised through the regulator. We can, as Mr Shannon said,
                differentiate between the prices of essentials and
                non-essentials. We can insist, demand, cajole, and put pressure
                on NIE to adopt greater social responsibility to its customers
                and use its profits to soften the blow of high energy prices,
                particularly for low income families. And we can, as Dr O’Hagan
                and Mr Neeson suggested, look at the issue of energy from a more
                strategic point of view, whether it be north, south, east or
                west, as well as renewable and alternative sources of energy —
                a vital component in this whole strategic plan.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, we need
                to promote energy efficiency and, above all, to protect those in
                need. I do not know whether this House is aware that in 1988
                there were more than 600 deaths — they are called &quot;excess
                winter deaths&quot; — directly linked to the cold. That is an
                astounding figure. These are people who cannot afford to turn on
                an extra electric bar because the prices are so high. We have
                got to do something to combat that: it is a matter of urgency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to research the cause of these deaths
                on a cross-departmental basis covering health, age, housing, and
                economic issues. We must not just accept a domestic energy
                efficiency scheme. We must go further than that and adopt a
                wide-ranging scheme with no limitations on age or income,
                particularly of those over 60. We need an adequate national fuel
                poverty strategy, combined with an overview of energy prices and
                all the other issues. Let us hope that the Minister will do that
                when conducting his inquiry.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monopoly has been a way of life in Northern
                Ireland. It thrived during the long, dark days of direct rule
                when essential services stagnated and little changed. The storm
                of two years ago starkly illustrated just how critically ill the
                electricity industry had become. The same could be said of
                railways and other public utilities that suffered under the
                neglect of our absentee minders. We are now, I hope, in a
                position to address a range of issues critical to the emergence
                of a modern economy, finely tuned to compete with the rest of
                Europe. Electricity is central to that, so it is right that this
                motion should be debated today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Historically, this part of Ireland was at the
                forefront of providing electricity. There is hardly a town or
                village that does not boast that it was among the first in
                Ireland with some type of innovative production of electricity.
                Today, of course, electricity is not a novelty or a luxury, but
                an essential service affecting every one of us, whether as
                individuals, businesspeople or employees. From the moment we are
                born until we finally depart, we are dependent on electricity in
                one way or another.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a right to be concerned about the
                cost of electricity and its impact on not only our personal
                lives but on the modern economy that we wish to create.
                Following the reunification of their country, the Germans
                treated provision of a modern electricity industry as their
                highest priority. Old, inefficient plants that were uneconomical
                and highly damaging to the environment were taken out of service
                and replaced with efficient new equipment. Wind farms
                strategically placed in the areas where they have least impact
                on the environment are playing a vital role in ensuring that the
                electricity consumed comes mostly from renewable energy. That
                helps to redress the environmental cost of producing electricity
                and acts as an incentive for further development in the field.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question of cost is critical to our
                attempts to enable existing industries to remain competitive and
                to attract new inward investment. Such attempts are already
                severely handicapped by the strength of sterling and the
                disincentives created by corporation tax laws. The development
                of a European grid that would create economies of scale and
                increase competition between providers is an objective that must
                be pursued with full speed. The integration of electricity
                supplies on the island of Ireland is a key element in the
                eradication of inefficiencies and duplication. We must create a
                cost-effective industry that is capable of playing the role
                required of it to allow the Assembly to oversee the rebuilding
                of an economy severely damaged by the troubles of the last 30
                years. Indeed, gross inefficiency has been present in public
                utilities for much longer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion goes to the heart of the issue. We
                are entitled to ask the British Government to recognise their
                responsibility to provide us with the resources to rebuild our
                infrastructure, just as German industry is being rebuilt with
                the help of generous contributions from the federal Government.
                The production and supply of electricity at a reasonable cost is
                central to our objective.</p>

                an agreement about the motion. The Democratic Unionist Party
                will support whatever the Members have agreed. It is good to see

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well, I shall deal with Germany later on,
                perhaps. We know that the Member had a good time there last week
                as he mentioned it three or four times in his speech.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall return to the matter in hand. In
                Northern Ireland the costs of energy use are higher than in any
                other part of the United Kingdom. Households here expend 15·7%
                of their budget on energy use, as opposed to 12·5% in the rest
                of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland householders spend 7·7%
                of their budgets on electricity, whereas in the rest of the
                United Kingdom it is only 6·3%. So, for the ordinary man and
                woman in the street, the senior citizen or the family with young
                children, the cost of electricity is a higher component of their
                living costs than for those in the rest of the United Kingdom.
                Northern Ireland was sold short in the privatisation Bill that
                was brought forward by Sir Richard Needham. I had a wry smile
                last week when I heard Richard Needham telling us about the
                benefits of moving into the Euro zone. I thought of the fiasco
                that he organised then and the prices that we now have to pay as
                a result.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such high prices affect families, pensioners
                and other ordinary consumers, but they also have a damaging
                effect on industry in Northern Ireland. Companies such as
                Michelin and Montupet agree that electricity costs have a
                detrimental effect on their output and sales.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It also has a downside. When the IDB tries to
                sell Northern Ireland abroad, companies with high electricity
                usage look at the cost of energy in Northern Ireland and compare
                it to that in Portugal, Spain, and other European countries.
                They say &quot;Hold on a minute — the price of energy is very
                expensive in Northern Ireland&quot;, and then consider setting
                up in other countries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The increase of around 9% announced by NIE is
                shocking, and it is important that this House unite to say that
                it is not acceptable. It is not acceptable practice, and it is
                not an acceptable policy. Having said that, privatisation has
                put NIE in a position to do such things. Recently I looked
                through a book listing the top 100 companies in Northern
                Ireland. The most profitable company was NIE — or Viridian, or
                whatever it wants to call itself. Premier Power was eighth, and
                NIGEN was tenth. Three companies involved in electricity are
                among the top ten most profitable companies in Northern Ireland.
                That says a lot when consumers are suffering as a result of the
                cost of electricity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some time ago the regulator began looking at
                electricity generating costs and how they could be addressed. I
                understand that an arrangement has been agreed for Ballylumford
                power station, which could reduce the cost of generating
                electricity there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the last two years there have been
                proposals for Kilroot that would significantly reduce costs,
                certainly in the short term. The Minister has to make the call
                on that matter. A decision has to be made — it is one that
                could significantly reduce costs and benefit our community —
                and it concerns the proposal to burn ore emulsion in Kilroot.
                The Minister has to make that call, and there will be an
                environmental impact. There is also the long-term aspect in that
                the deal <i>in situ</i> will run out in 2016, whereas a new deal
                for Kilroot would continue until 2025. The advantages to be
                gained now must be weighed against possible future
                disadvantages.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the environmental impact, burning
                Orimulsion with a proper flue gas desulphurisation process would
                significantly reduce the emissions currently produced by Kilroot
                power station. While it would not be as beneficial as combined
                cycle gas turbine transmission, it would be more beneficial than
                the coal burning system currently in use at Kilroot. There would
                also be a significant reduction in costs up to 2016, compared to
                those we currently face. The Minister has some room for
                manoeuvre, and we look forward to an early outcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect to Viridian, the Minister must
                use all his pressure to bring it to heel and reduce the cost of
                electricity to consumers and to industry.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McMenamin:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank my Colleague Mr Byrne for moving this
                very important motion. For the life of me, I cannot comprehend
                how consumers on low income can afford to heat their homes. On
                average, the cost of electricity is 20% higher in Northern
                Ireland than in England. This is a major issue, which needs to
                be addressed seriously.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Electricity costs make possible investors
                think twice about where to locate industry. My constituency of
                West Tyrone and all areas west of the Bann can offer no
                alternative to oil — at least Greater Belfast can offer gas to
                industry. The cost of electricity in the Republic of Ireland is
                50% lower than in the North, and that may be one reason why its
                economy is booming.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A considerable number of Housing Executive
                tenants heat their homes with the Economy 7 system. This type of
                heating can be costly if not used properly, and residents living
                alone can find it impossible to heat their homes properly. The
                average expenditure on lighting and heating is 6% to 8% of
                household income. Lone pensioners need to spend an average of
                23% of their income on heating. However, they are more likely to
                underspend on fuel because they cannot afford the expense and
                want to avoid debt. For every degree centigrade drop below the
                winter average, there is a corresponding rise of up to 8,000
                deaths in Great Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another major problem is the threat of
                disconnection. It can cause untold anxiety to young mothers with
                children and to senior citizens. I appreciate that there are
                several ways to pay the outstanding bill before disconnection,
                but sometimes the householder might be ill or disabled and have
                difficulty in paying.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My constituency of West Tyrone is a rural
                area, and electricity charges can be crippling to small farmers.
                Young married couples with a mortgage, who have never been
                mentioned in these equations, can also find these costs
                crippling — a major burden on their income and a factor in
                their outgoings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Landlords who own flats and install their own
                meters for individual flats can charge whatever they want for a
                unit of electricity, and it is generally higher than the normal
                tariff charged by NIE.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One way of easing the burden of electricity
                charges might be to remove the standing charge that is
                applicable to all households in Northern Ireland. I ask for a
                special task force to be set up to examine the issue. I also
                suggest that charges be restructured to target social need in
                all areas of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I add my voice to those who have
                congratulated the Member for West Tyrone for bringing us to a
                very happy occasion of both a substantive motion and a proposed
                amendment before the House, with which we can all agree. Like my
                Colleague from Strangford, I hope to be able to come to an
                agreement about the final motion. Then we can send out a clarion
                call that we are opposed to what NIE is doing to Northern
                Ireland and electricity prices in the Province. We need to be
                certain about the signal we send from the House. It is good that
                we have that agreement, and I hope we can finalise that by the
                end of the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One comment with which I disagree was made by
                Ms O’Hagan. She said that she was opposed to having two
                systems of electricity power and distribution on such a small
                island. Her suggestion that we create an even bigger monopoly on
                the entire island of Ireland is something that I hope the House
                deplores. That would do even more harm to the consumer and
                undermine further the consumer’s rights. I hope that the House
                will knock on the head the bad economic case that she
                constructed. It would not make any economic sense at all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Competition in this field is what is
                required. Failure to have real price competition is what has
                caused some of the consumer’s problems. That is also one of
                the reasons why Mr&nbsp;Byrne has brought forward this motion.
                We do not have the necessary price competition to give the
                consumers what they deserve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like all other Members who have spoken in
                this debate, I am deeply disappointed by how NIE has acted
                today. It appears to have wanted to get its blow in first,
                saying at lunchtime today, before this debate and in the
                knowledge that it would take place, that prices are to be hiked.
                That is disgraceful and is not only a snub to this place and to
                elected representatives from across Northern Ireland who have
                found agreement tonight, but also an insult to the consumer. NIE
                should reflect upon its actions and realise that it is in the
                dock tonight and is being held accountable and found wanting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that the sooner it wakes up to that
                reality and start to reflect the needs of the consumer, the
                better for this society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard questions from right across
                this House tonight. Why is it that electricity prices are
                considerably lower in other European member states? Electricity
                is generated there in the same way as it is generated in
                Northern Ireland. In Scotland, prices are about 14% lower than
                in Northern Ireland. In Spain they are over 50% lower than in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why is it that in Northern Ireland such an
                inflated price is put on a necessity? As other Members have
                said, electricity is not a luxury — but a vital utility for
                the entire community. The reason cannot be the price of crude
                oil, because crude oil is the same price in the Republic of
                Ireland and Spain as it is here. It is due to other issues, and
                I suggest that one of them is the way in which the industry is
                structured here. Indeed, Mr&nbsp;Neeson said that the structure
                of NIE privatisation is the error that lies at the bottom of
                this problem. I agree with him on that point. I believe that the
                structure of the industry is wrong, and it goes back to the
                mismanagement of privatisation by Sir&nbsp;Richard&nbsp;Needham.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House should reflect very carefully on
                the economic advice that he is now purporting to give to people
                in Northern Ireland about the future of other parts of our
                economy. People should draw back from taking advice from that
                particular gentleman when we are living with the consequences of
                one of his most major decisions, which, as we can see,
                drastically affects the pockets of all our constituents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NIE has been wrong in what it has done. It
                has been found to be wrong, and I hope that the Assembly will
                send out the clear signal that NIE must change its policy, that
                it must change its prices, and that it must favour the consumer,
                not the fat cat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, but I think it is
                somewhat ironic that we are discussing this issue when the
                impact of climate change upon the world is becoming more and
                more evident. This time last year we might have thought that
                there could be terrible storms, droughts and other climatic
                upheavals, but that they would not affect us. They might affect
                Venezuela, Bangladesh, the Maldives or the Seychelles, but the
                United Kingdom would be safe. However, even as I speak, a large
                proportion of Great Britain is under water, and if the forecast
                is to be believed, the same will happen to a significant
                proportion of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The penny is beginning to drop that the main
                reason for this is the generation of greenhouse gases by Western
                society. We will have to learn that we cannot continue to pour
                vast amounts of these gases into the atmosphere and not pay a
                terrible price for doing so. We have to be very careful, because
                if we demand a price cut in electricity — and many of us feel
                that the price is too high in the Province — we will simply
                increase demand and the emissions into the atmosphere. The price
                cut has to be structured in such a way that it encourages energy
                conservation here — something that we, as a society, are
                extremely poor at. One of the suggestions that has been put
                forward is that we should target price reductions at those who
                are most in need — pensioners, the unemployed and the
                disabled. I would subscribe to that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been suggested that the pricing for
                the first 5,000 or 10,000 units, for example, should be
                deliberately reduced to enable those who are the low users —
                the people who are on low incomes — to enjoy basic heat, light
                and other facilities. However, once one gets above what could be
                ascertained to be a reasonable level, price increases would
                start to cut in to discourage people from wasting electricity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also believe that there should be greater
                emphasis on insulation and the conservation of energy in the
                Province. NIE is to be applauded — and perhaps this is one of
                the few bouquets that it will get this evening — for
                introducing the eco-energy tariff. This is a tariff by which
                consumers can buy electricity from a pool that is generated
                through environmentally friendly methods, such as wind power and
                wave power.</p>

                However, we have to pay a higher price for electricity under
                that tariff. Does the Member think that it would be appropriate
                for renewable and alternative energy sources to be subsidised so
                that we would be paying a lower eco-energy tariff and a higher
                price for other energy?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unfortunate that the wrong signal has
                been sent out regarding the eco tariff. It is, in fact, 1·2p
                per unit more expensive than standard fossil fuel electricity.
                NIE should send out the correct signal to society and say
                &quot;We will actually price that tariff at a lower or similar
                cost to the standard tariff.&quot; That would encourage more
                consumers to use eco-friendly electricity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No matter what we do, we must be extremely
                careful with the private consumer and industry, because the last
                thing we can afford to let happen in this society, or anywhere
                else in Europe, is a rapid expansion in the use of electricity
                generated through fossil fuels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to sound like a latter-day
                soothsayer saying &quot;Woe, woe and thrice woe&quot;, but if
                what we have seen over this past few weeks is anything to go by,
                this Province, and the entire world, is facing an ecological
                catastrophe. We must devise some system that reduces the cost of
                electricity to those most in need, and one that encourages all
                of us, including the people who run this building, to conserve
                electricity and energy, but that also ensures our continued
                economic growth. This is a difficult issue, and I do not envy
                the decisions that the Minister has to make. One option is the
                adoption of Orimulsion as one of the fuels to be used in the
                Province for electricity generation. NIGEN has examined this,
                and it will lead to a reduction in greenhouse gases, but let us
                not rush into a knee-jerk reaction by saying &quot;Cut
                prices&quot;. We have to think of the consequences to society,
                because we are doing no one any favours by giving them more heat
                and warmth at a cheaper price if they are up to their necks in
                water as a result of flooding. Let us think long and hard before

                the extent to which my time was taken up by energy matters. I
                had not appreciated the amount of activity, given that the
                energy market is privatised. Nevertheless, a substantial amount
                of time is taken up because so many different things are
                currently happening in the energy field. Not only is there the
                question of the gas industry and how it develops, but there is
                also the question of the all-island market, and I will come back
                to that. There are questions relating to pricing and to Northern
                Ireland’s competitive position alongside other European
                regions. There is the overall European dimension and a whole
                range of issues that I will try to cover in the time available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne asked &quot;Why do Northern Ireland
                consumers pay more?&quot; This matter was brought up by several
                Members. We pay more because in Northern Ireland it costs more
                to generate and distribute electricity. Most of the plant is 20
                to 30&nbsp;years old and is inefficient. Until recently, the
                choice of fuels has been limited, although fortunately that is
                now changing.</p>
                <i>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The competitiveness of the local industry and
                our ability to attract further inward investment are not helped
                by higher prices. They also impose an unacceptable burden on
                families with a low income, and Members placed great emphasis on
                that. However, I challenge Mr Byrne’s comment that there is no
                coherent policy direction, because energy issues are referred to
                in the Programme for Government. I assure him that we are
                developing a policy to create a more competitive market.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are in this position because a bad deal
                was made in 1989-90. We were given contracts that no one would
                enter into in the present circumstances. We are paying for the
                availability of plant and the generation of electricity. The
                cost of fuel is significant, and that is part of the price we
                pay. We have been wrestling, as has the regulator, with this
                unfortunate legacy. None of us wants it, none of us would agree
                to it today, but we are left to clean up the mess.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne said that nothing was being done
                about Kilroot, but I assure him that much has been done. Members
                have referred to several issues, including generation with
                Orimulsion, and I assure Mr Byrne that much time and energy has
                been spent on seeking the best options for Kilroot and the best
                policy framework in which the Department can help tackle the
                issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept the amendment put forward by Mr
                Beggs — a total review is a good thing. It is pointless to
                review parts of it, and I hope that we will be resolving the
                motion, as amended, at the end of the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many comments have been made about the
                monopoly situation and about the percentages of increases, and
                comparisons have been made with other regions. Some of the
                statistics were accurate, others slightly off, but the
                fundamental point has been grasped — we should not be in this
                position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding today’s price announcement, the
                regulator does not have the equivalent powers, but we are
                planning to correct that. Great Britain has a Utilities Act
                2000, and next year we hope to bring in a Bill to cover the
                utilities area and the role of the regulator. Members are
                unhappy, and this legislation will reflect their concerns. I had
                hoped to introduce this legislation in the first half of next
                year, but it is complicated. However, we will try to have it
                later next year if progress goes to plan. It would give the
                regulator specific powers for the generation section that do not
                apply currently in Great Britain, so perhaps the Assembly can
                make a difference.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NIE price increases are governed by the terms
                of the privatisation contract. The regulator has a role, and
                will have to examine the proposals. I will be paying close
                attention and will consult with the regulator. He will have to
                satisfy himself that there is economic justification for the
                increases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This does not address the social questions
                raised. People involved with constituency work in Northern
                Ireland will know that we are in dire straits, particularly our
                senior citizens. Mr&nbsp;Shannon and others have made this
                point. We are concerned and horrified that 600 excess deaths are
                deemed acceptable. Changes in the social security system have
                reflected what can be achieved. Unfortunately, the Social
                Security Agency (SSA) has been slow to realise that Northern
                Ireland is starting from a much higher base. Many houses are
                poorly insulated, but alleviation schemes are in place. Many
                elderly people are huddled round small fires. In this day and
                age it is a terrible indictment on all of us that people are
                freezing to death in this country. The Assembly must address
                this problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The climate change levy, to be introduced in
                April 2001, will increase the equivalent of between 5·5% and
                8·4%, depending on demand and load factors. The levy can be
                offset by a reduction in employers’ national insurance
                contributions. Intensive energy users will also be able to take
                advantage of this, which will have some impact. There was a
                battle with the Treasury over the gas industry. We were
                partially successful in securing an exemption for the industry
                so that for at least five&nbsp;years it will not be subject to
                the levy. The new gas industry will be able to get off the
                ground and will not be penalised before it has a mature
                distribution system in place. We also secured some additional
                assistance for the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) sector, on
                which many people in rural areas are dependent. I welcome the
                fact that there is no time limit on that assistance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference has been made to the potential for
                wind and wave power. Experiments are already under way, and
                local surveyors Kirk, McClure &amp; Morton have been employed on
                behalf of the British and Irish Governments to examine the
                potential for wind and wave power on the island. The initial
                licensing has been granted for the first tranche of experiments,
                and we will continue to look at it closely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson referred to the &quot;mess&quot; of
                privatisation and to the possibility of scrapping all business
                contracts, but it is not as easy as that. This is a difficult
                situation, but alternatives should be considered. I can assure
                everyone that we are looking at radical alternatives. The
                regulator has been struggling for the past few years to try to
                deal with the problem. When contracts are viable and lucrative,
                it is difficult to say to people &quot;Show your social
                responsibility and let the people off the hook.&quot; Private
                business does not operate in this way. Consequently, our method
                of dealing with the problem needs to be examined, and we are
                trying to produce radical proposals to alleviate the
                difficulties. I cannot say whether the Treasury will permit them
                or whether they will be viable. The Treasury earned twice the
                expected revenue for privatisation, and we are left paying the
                price.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson mentioned the levy being imposed by
                the Irish Government on gas. This is a huge issue which could
                potentially pose a threat to our ability to open the gas market.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr O’Hagan and a number of others mentioned
                the all-island issue. Even if one takes the whole island, the
                energy market is tiny. It makes sense only if one links up with
                Great Britain and, from there, to mainland Europe. That is what
                we are doing with electricity. The interconnector from Scotland
                will, we hope, be in operation by this time next year, and we
                wish to ensure that the gas supply between North and South is
                connected. Most gas comes from Scotland in any case, but the
                Corrib field off the west coast of Ireland must also be
                included.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this way, we shall have a gas and
                electricity market that is genuinely open to competition. By
                next April, we hope to increase the proportion of the energy
                market exposed to competition to 35% for larger commercial
                users, the maximum we are allowed at present. However, that
                figure could grow, and I do not doubt for a moment that the
                European Union will eventually open up most of the market.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question of transmission and distribution
                charges was raised by several Members, including Mr Byrne and Mr
                Dallat. After generation, they represent the largest single
                component of electricity costs. The regulator has embarked on a
                transmission and distribution price control review, with new
                price controls coming into operation in April 2002. This matter
                is under close examination for I understand that our region
                requires a large number of distribution networks in isolated
                rural areas. Nevertheless, the amount of money is huge, and any
                review would have to take that into account.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots represented the downside for the IDB.
                I could not agree more. It is not very nice trying to market
                this Province against a backdrop of high charges. That issue was
                raised by several Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McMenamin, and others, raised the issue
                about areas west of the Bann where gas is not available. We must
                face the fact that there are, quite frankly, certain parts of
                the Province in which it will not be available. However, we must
                try to get it to those areas if we possibly can.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am approaching the end of my allotted time.
                The Department has listened very closely to the substance of the
                debate, and officials are present and are taking notes. We shall
                take seriously what Members say, and I am committed — as the
                Programme for Government commits us — to reviewing the whole
                energy situation. It is almost a fundamental right, for one can
                do nothing in life or in business without it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to cover all issues, including
                distribution as well as generation. I assure the House that,
                together with the regulator, the electricity consumers’
                committee and other interests, we shall actively pursue the
                review to realise our objective of achieving a competitive
                market whose prices give us a playing field level with that in
                neighbouring regions. That is one of my principal objectives for
                the Department.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that Mr Byrne told me that he
                would be content to accept my amendment. I need speak no further
                on it. However, I understand that we are limited by procedures
                as to how the amendment can be incorporated.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Members who took part in the
                debate. I appreciate their comments about the timeliness of our
                discussing this issue. It is fair to say that there is a
                consensus that electricity costs in Northern Ireland are too
                high. People are asking why this is so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has said the reason is
                privatisation, whose mishandling in 1992 has given Northern
                Ireland this high-cost relic. Several very good points were made
                about the high cost of electricity, particularly for low-income
                families and pensioners. Mr Shannon made a very strong point
                that NIE should consider some way of introducing differential
                tariffs relative to electricity use.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Members emphasised the handicap
                currently being experienced by Northern Ireland industry. I say
                to the Minister that if the climate change levy is increased in
                April, as scheduled, it will be imperative that this Assembly
                try to ensure that Northern Ireland industry is not
                disadvantaged as it is at present.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells, Dr O’Hagan and others made strong
                environmental points. I fully agree that we need a radical
                examination of how we generate electricity. However, there is a
                real world and there is a make- believe world, and essentially
                this debate has been about the real world — how consumers are
                paying such a high charge for their electricity. There should be
                a radical appraisal of how we generate electricity in the
                future, and I concur with the general sentiments in favour of
                assessing alternative sources. I recognise that there has been
                an increase in one type of electricity generation in Northern
                Ireland, which is more eco-friendly, but the cost is
                prohibitive. In the short term we should not handicap domestic
                or commercial consumers as we have done to date. We have had
                seven years of high electricity prices; the issue has not been
                confronted. Therefore — and I say this to the Minister — we
                look forward to his bringing forward new proposals and working
                constructively with the regulator.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not blaming the current Administration
                and their Programme for Government. They are going to address
                the issue, and I welcome the statements made by the Minister in
                that regard. Consumers want this issue treated with urgency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This afternoon’s proposal by NIE to
                increase electricity costs by a possible 9% from January steps
                up the pressure. There has been some annoyance about NIE’s
                making this announcement today. It does not concern me that
                much; it only adds to the debate and increases the urgency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs moved a constructive amendment, and
                I fully accept its merits. The electricity market is not just
                about the generation and supply of electricity; it is also about
                its transmission and distribution. We have certainly heard a lot
                about the transmission and distribution costs that pertain here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am all in favour of economies of scale and
                of opening into a wider electricity grid, be it on an
                all-Ireland or on a European scale. The Minister has referred to
                the benefits that can accrue from the Scottish electricity
                interconnector; he is also trying to get a wider distribution of
                natural gas to other parts of Northern Ireland. Mr McMenamin, my
                Colleague from West Tyrone, and the rest of those of us who live
                in the west, have no alternative to electricity. This is a
                severe handicap. A potential industrial investor, thinking about
                setting up in my part of the world, was put off because there
                was no available supply of natural gas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate has been constructive and
                worthwhile. It is timely, and I welcome what all Members have
                said. Ms Morrice suggested we benefit from wider economies of
                scale and tap into the wider network of electricity generation
                and supply. All these points are welcome at this time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lastly, many Members paid tribute to what the
                OFREG regulator has done in Northern Ireland. He and his
                dedicated staff are paid from the public purse, and until now
                their views have largely been ignored. As this is a devolved
                matter, it is important that the Assembly address the discretion
                and area of competence of the regulator. This will allow us a
                real impact on electricity prices in Northern Ireland. The
                Minister referred to the Utilities Act 2000, which will come
                into operation in Britain in 2002. This piece of legislation
                will have at its core the duty of the regulator to protect the
                interests of the consumer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members referred to the need for
                balance between the interests of the shareholders of NIE —
                and, indeed, the power stations, — and the interests of the
                consumer. The consumer has no option but to accept the price
                that is determined by NIE. Therefore this Assembly must now in
                the short time that is left put its weight behind the regulator
                in the interests of social justice. There is no great desire for
                the Minister to establish a review group to report on
                transmission, distribution costs and the remaining Kilroot
                contract to the Assembly before the final proposals for the
                third price control are submitted in July&nbsp;2001. These
                proposals will come into effect in 2002. I welcome what the
                Minister has said in this regard, and I hope that the 630,000
                domestic consumers and 43,000 business consumers in Northern
                Ireland will reap some dividends from our deliberations. The
                only real issue is that time is of the essence, and it is in the
                public interest that these contracts be renegotiated.</p>
