                consultation with it on the public expenditure proposals
                contained in the Budget (No 2) Bill. The Bill may therefore

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind the House that the Second Stage of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate follows on from the Bill’s First
                Stage last Tuesday and the Supply resolution for the 2001-02
                Main Estimates that was considered on Monday 18 June. The
                purpose of the Budget (No 2) Bill is to give legislative effect
                to the resource Estimates that were approved through the Supply
                resolution that was passed last Monday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the wide-ranging and valuable debate
                then, I do not intend to detain the House with unnecessary
                repetition of the detail implicit in the spending authorisation
                contained in the Bill. I gave much of that detail last week.
                However, I will summarise the main features of the Bill in
                accordance with the nature of the Second Stage debate as
                envisaged under Standing Order 30.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The principle of the Bill is to authorise the
                use of resources totalling £5,021,262,000 by Departments and
                the issue of £4,679,167,000 from the Northern Ireland
                Consolidated Fund in respect of the Main Estimates for 2001-02.
                Members received copies of the detailed Main Estimates booklet
                on Monday 11 June.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to the Committee for Finance
                and Personnel for the attention that it has given, and continues
                to give, to matters of public expenditure and related procedural
                issues. I am also grateful for the confirmation from Mr Molloy,
                Chairperson of the Committee, that there has been appropriate
                consultation on the public expenditure proposals contained in
                the Bill, as set out in his letter to the Speaker dated 18 June.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the first full year in which Budget
                allocations will be determined and managed on a resource basis.
                Aside from the technical dimension of that, the transition
                involves the introduction of several new terms. Most of those
                were covered in the Vote on Account process in the Budget Bill
                in February. However, the Budget (No 2) Bill introduces an
                additional new term — &quot;accruing resources&quot; — which
                represents the Departments’ receipts or income. It was known
                as &quot;appropriations in aid&quot; in the old cash regime. I
                hope that clarifies matters for Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Speaker has acknowledged, the Budget
                (No 2) Bill represents the endgame regarding the 2001-02 Budget
                — a process that started last year and ran from the Budget
                vote in December 2000 to the Supply resolution debate last
                Monday. The spending plans reflected in the Bill have been
                approved and endorsed by the Assembly, but I will be happy to
                deal with any points of principle that may arise.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Finance
                and Personnel (Mr Molloy):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                The Minister of Finance and Personnel presented the draft Budget
                for 2001-02 on 17 October 2000. That was followed by a
                substantive Budget debate on 14 November and by the final Budget
                debate on 18 December. A sequence of events was involved. It
                really comes down to the question of whether the Assembly was
                given sufficient opportunity to properly consider the Bill’s
                implications and, if not, whether there is sufficient
                justification for proceeding in the absence of such
                consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Finance and Personnel is
                concerned that, due to the Westminster and local government
                elections, there has been limited time for Assembly Committees
                to have had appropriate opportunity to analyse the Estimates and
                to discuss them with their respective Ministers. In more normal
                circumstances it is the duty of the Committee for Finance and
                Personnel to ensure that all the Committees’ views on the
                financial provision proposed for the various Departments are
                co-ordinated and brought before the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly it is not possible to have such a
                properly informed debate on the Estimates for the current year.
                However, the Minister of Finance and Personnel kept the
                Committee fully informed and the Assembly updated on a regular
                basis on the preparation of the final version of the Estimates
                for 2001-02. The Finance and Personnel Committee is content that
                the requirements of Standing Order 40 for appropriate
                consultation have been fully met and that it is in order for the
                Budget (No 2) Bill to proceed. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget debate in any legislature is an
                important event. The Budget dictates how we will govern
                ourselves. It has a tremendous effect on the lives of our
                constituents, the economy and social well-being.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this stage of the Bill it is possible to
                deal only with very general terms. Notwithstanding that, it is
                evident that the total amount of money we can spend is
                determined by our income and not by our expenditure. It is
                almost a self-evident truth that our income in this case is
                capped by the grant-in-aid received from the Exchequer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We know from previous Assembly debates that
                we have cross-party agreement that the amount of grant-in-aid is
                inadequate. Its inadequacy has been exposed more and more in our
                experiences over the past two years. Each time we look at a
                departmental budget we see deficiencies, not in the work that is
                being carried out, but in the inability to have the money to do
                further things.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On previous occasions the Minister has
                indicated to the Assembly the urgent work he is doing with the
                other Ministers and with the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister regarding the famous — or now infamous — Barnett
                formula, which dictates in many ways how we govern in Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like the Minister’s assurance that
                those negotiations, which we all hope will go to a higher level,
                are now well progressed. Perhaps he could give us some
                indication as to whether there is a willingness on the part of
                central Government to redress the inadequacies of the Barnett
                formula and also to take on board the problems we are having by
                the revelations that each Department makes to the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have only to look at the Department of the
                Environment and its Committee to see huge deficits in water and
                sewerage provision, roads provision, hospital provision and
                adequate medical and surgical training.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those deficits have come about as a result of
                inadequate expenditure in previous years. It is estimated that
                there has been underspending on our infrastructure and on our
                primary resources of health and education for almost the entire
                period of direct rule. That being the case, it is surely a sound
                and valid argument that that deficit should be restored from a
                top-up; not from current restricted financing. A top-up would
                enable us to recover and address that inadequacy in these major
                issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Infrastructure is not a word that excites the
                ordinary man and woman in the street, but if you do not have
                infrastructure you cannot progress as a society, you cannot
                sustain industrial development, and you cannot attract inward
                investment. All those things impinge directly on the educational
                prospects — and the healthcare, moreover — of every man,
                woman, and child in our community.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had a series of almost catastrophic
                events that were never envisaged in the Barnett formula. Some of
                those were in agriculture — the BSE crisis, the foot-and-mouth
                disease outbreak and the threat of the run-down of our fishing
                industry. Those three major crisis areas in agriculture were not
                provided for by the formula used to give us our financing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking at the other Departments, £60
                million is required for sewerage and £100 million for
                infrastructure. Those are major issues that need consideration.
                I doubt that the current Budget can properly address our ongoing
                plans. However, those will have to be addressed now or in the
                immediate future. I am talking about matters such as the recent
                Hayes Report which, if it is accepted, predicates a huge
                investment in hospital infrastructure and medical services. We
                do not have adequate resources to meet that need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only alternative to the capped Barnett
                formula spending is to use direct taxation, which is a dirty
                word because it always means increasing taxes. The Scottish
                Parliament has a direct taxation revenue-raising power of up to
                three pence in the pound. We do not have that power, and I am
                not arguing that we should have that facility. However, because
                of the strictness of our current grant-in-aid controls we will
                have to review the existing arrangements or look at
                alternatives. There is a great reluctance — understandably and
                sometimes justifiably — among all Assembly parties to increase
                direct or indirect taxation, even in the form of licences. In
                the next two days that issue may crop up. All parties bitterly
                oppose minuscule increases in licensing fees, and that indicates
                that, even if we had direct taxation, we would not be able to
                use it. In the meantime, we must tailor our Budget and our
                commitment to economic and social development to the resources
                available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another huge area coming up is the recovery
                of the agriculture industry and its knock-on effect in tourism,
                which has faced horrendous problems in many areas of Northern
                Ireland. South Down has suffered a triple whammy as regards
                tourism, agriculture and fishing, with no apparent real moneys
                being directed to those problems. I hope that special extra
                funding will be directed from the Executive to address those
                issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the area of fishing alone, the Irish
                Government have made an additional £20 million available for
                the improvement of their fishing fleet while we are decreasing
                the capacity of our fishing fleet. I do not want to labour that
                issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have the question of building new
                maternity hospitals, which was debated on the radio this
                morning. Where is the money coming from for such projects? These
                are real issues that any debate needs to address, because unless
                we can make a change in our economic and social well-being — a
                change in the fabric of our society — then our efforts in
                relation to our devolved responsibilities are brought to nought
                by lack of finance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister, in his opening remarks, said
                that I would fully understand the meaning of the term
                &quot;accruing resources&quot;, because it is a substitution for
                &quot;appropriation in aid&quot;. I do not know what
                &quot;appropriation in aid&quot; is, so perhaps he would explain
                that phrase also.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are very grateful for the opportunity to
                consult at this important stage of the Budget. As well as
                talking about the overall principles, I would like to look in
                some detail at certain areas we would like to see underlined in
                the Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I begin with one of the Assembly’s most
                important considerations — the future of our children. We hope
                to see plans for a children’s commissioner coming on-stream in
                the next year. Can the Minister tell us what plans have been
                made for additional expenditure for that purpose? Which
                Department — or Departments, as we are talking about joined-up
                government — will have responsibility for the office, and how
                will that be reflected in future Budgets?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is recognition of the importance of
                research and statistics as a firm foundation on which to base
                future policy analyses. Through the many parliamentary questions
                that we have asked this year, we have ascertained that there are
                no available statistics on some topics, such as, for example,
                the number of children living in poverty. It is unfortunate that
                such statistics do not exist. In order to fine-tune policies, as
                the Executive suggested in their position report to the Assembly
                for the Programme for Government, we need high-quality, relevant
                and accurate information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are disappointed that, apart from specific
                funding for the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency,
                only the Department of Higher and Further Education, Training
                and Employment has allowed for departmental research and
                development. Although the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment has the Industrial Research and Technology Unit,
                other Departments, such as those responsible for the social
                development and health budgets, should be explicitly
                prioritising research moneys. Will the Minister look into the
                level of each Department’s research budget and tell us what
                the budget accommodation is?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill does not show the amount of money to
                be spent on private finance initiatives (PFIs) and how they
                deliver public services. As we have asked before, does the
                Executive accept that if they continue to pursue expenditure by
                private means, they are mortgaging our children’s future?
                Spending money on private firms now means that we have to pay it
                back later and, it is accepted, with a great deal of interest.
                What percentage of money does the Bill allocate to private
                companies, and what will the repayment be? We would appreciate a
                response to these questions. We do not believe that private
                finance represents value for money for our people today or
                tomorrow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also want to talk about economic issues.
                What is the Minister doing to accommodate the recommendations
                made by the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment on
                the ‘Strategy 2010’ report concerning tax? A number of our
                recommendations favour helping the economy to grow and become
                stronger through initiatives, tax breaks or other imaginative
                ways. Are those recommendations being accommodated? If so, what
                is being done through the Budget to implement proposals such as
                tax breaks for the creative industries, greater support for the
                social economy or the needs of small business?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The euro is one of my own areas of interest.
                As we all know, the euro will be in place and in the pockets of
                people south of the border. What moneys will be set aside to
                help Northern Ireland’s small businesses manage the position
                they will find themselves in? Will there be a proposal to help
                small businesses give their prices in euros as well as pounds?
                What initiatives are there?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to raise a point that was brought to
                me by trade unions about the minimum wage. The Assembly
                supported the £5 minimum wage, and it is hoped that legislation
                will be introduced in the near future to accommodate the
                pressure from the Assembly on that. What is the Minister doing
                in the Budget to prepare for that legislation?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Childcare is of great interest to the Women’s
                Coalition. What provision is in the Budget for subsidies for
                childcare places and for accommodating the parental leave
                measures that will come in through legislation in Brussels and
                London?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the Second Stage of the debate on the
                Budget (No 2) Bill — it is not an opportunity to rerun the
                supply debate of last week. In a Second Stage debate we discuss
                the principles and philosophy of a Bill, not its specific terms.
                Members had the opportunity to raise such points in the supply
                debate. Please bear that in mind.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take the point. I will conclude my remarks
                without going into too much detail, but I thought it important
                to raise those points for the Minister to consider.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My final point concerns peace building, which
                also concerns the future of our children. How can individual
                Departments, and the Executive as a whole, lead on issues such
                as challenging sectarianism? Although we are emerging from
                conflict, we still live in a deeply divided society. There
                should be an extensive programme to combat sectarianism in
                schools, community centres and at all levels of society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Political leaders can lead from the front by
                example. However, those leaders should look to the examples of
                women’s groups and trade unions that have done so much work
                and have such expertise in that area. Will the Executive
                consider, and respond to, the money that has been set aside for
                developing a strategy on community relations, anti-sectarianism
                and questions that we have on race and ethnicity?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a Second Stage debate, and we on this
                side want to come back to some of the issues at Consideration
                Stage and perhaps thereafter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget (No 2) Bill carries on from the
                previous Budget Bill and earlier Supply resolutions. As this is
                the Second Stage, we do not intend to divide the House today. We
                will consider the detail of the various appropriations contained
                in the draft legislation. We have no difficulty whatsoever with
                many of them, many of which are, necessarily and rightly, in
                general form. However, there are issues that concern us and
                should concern us, especially Members on this side of the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, the Minister and other Members
                will not be surprised that we will not forget or run away from
                expenditure under the Department of Finance and Personnel on,
                for instance, the North/South Ministerial Council, the various
                all-Ireland bodies and other areas, such as the Civic Forum. Our
                party will return to those issues later.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to put on record that our position in
                the House today does not in any way diminish our opposition to
                those areas of expenditure where we believe that the allocation
                of money does not represent good value for the people of
                Northern Ireland. The allocated money is being spent on a
                political project and not on delivering real and substantive
                benefits to the people on the ground on both sides. For
                instance, after a considerable period, many people still wonder
                exactly what the Civic Forum is supposed to be doing for its
                money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will return to those issues later. It
                would not be appropriate to go into them in detail at this
                stage, especially in the light of your earlier ruling, Mr Deputy
                Speaker, but I want to put the Minister on notice about them.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My contribution concerns a fairly small but
                important element of the Budget. I pay tribute to the Minister
                for his co-operation in ensuring that the requirements of the
                Government Resources and Accounts Act (Northern Ireland) 2001
                have been taken fully into account. Resource accounting is a new
                concept that takes the presentation of accounts away from simple
                receipts and payments. It enables Members to have a much more
                comprehensive picture of the state of the various Departments,
                and it is to be hoped that it will allow Members to identify
                areas where better use of public money can be made, where
                savings are possible and where additional services are feasible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I speak now as an individual — lest I get
                into trouble — but as Chairperson of the Audit Committee, I
                realise that for Departments to comply with the Act will involve
                additional work and additional pressure. Nevertheless, it is
                well worthwhile. The benefits are enormous, and they will
                further advance the Assembly’s impact on how public money is
                spent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the
                Public Accounts Committee and, in particular, to Mr Billy Bell,
                although he belongs to another party. That Committee has
                established itself as a very reliable watchdog to ensure that
                the bad practices of the past are eliminated. In the proposed
                Bill every penny spent must be accounted for, and civil servants
                at all levels now realise that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We hope that the dark days of direct rule are
                behind us. Let us hope that we never return to a situation where
                elected representatives are not in place to ensure that
                Government services are provided on a basis of best value,
                keeping in mind the need to target social need and test for
                equality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the years ahead, the services for which we
                are responsible can be transformed, provided that there is
                proper public scrutiny. It would be remiss of me not to pay
                tribute to the Comptroller and Auditor General, who no longer
                works in isolation but, for the first time, reports to elected
                representatives. That exercise is working extremely well, and
                the public at large realise that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, all of this would not be
                possible if everyone were not pulling in the same direction. The
                Audit Committee, the Public Accounts Committee and the Finance
                and Personnel Committee are all co-operating in the common
                interests of everyone. At times that may seem strange, but it is
                a reality. The Minister of Finance willingly participates in a
                spirit of co-operation, and that is a good omen for the future.
                The Assembly needs to blow its own trumpet at times. It has
                every reason to be proud of the fundamental changes that have
                taken place and that will continue, provided that common sense
                prevails and the wreckers do not have their way.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Minister, you will have heard my earlier
                remarks that this is the Second Stage of the Budget (No 2) Bill
                and not an attempt to rerun previous debates. I know that you
                will be judicious in your response.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I noted your earlier remarks, Mr Deputy
                Speaker, with some appreciation. Members need to appreciate the
                nature of the Budget exercise. This is obviously not an occasion
                when the Assembly can range freely over all the expenditure
                items in the budgets of the various Departments. We are trying
                to complete, in a competent and proper manner, the necessary
                procedures following the budgetary decisions made last year and
                approved by the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the basis of those budgetary decisions we
                were able to authorise expenditure in the first period of this
                financial year through the Vote on Account and the Budget Act
                (Northern Ireland) 2001. In this Bill we are authorising the
                rest of the expenditure for this financial year. Members want to
                have regard to, and Committees should ask, whether the Estimates
                and the Bill properly reflect those previous decisions. The fact
                is that they do. I know that some Members have opposed some of
                the provisions, but in the Budget (No 2) Bill we are doing what
                we are required to do, which is to provide for the competent
                authorisation and allocation of expenditure as already approved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some points dealt with particular areas of
                expenditure. I will not go into those, because those areas are
                not germane to today’s exercise. On the other hand, I do not
                want to sidestep everything, because many Members did not
                address the particulars of the Bill as such, but raised wider
                budgetary issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Chairperson of the Committee for Finance
                and Personnel, Mr Molloy registered the Committee’s concern
                about procedures — particularly in the longer term — and
                also recorded its satisfaction that there had been sufficient
                consultation with it to allow accelerated passage given the time
                constraints. I appreciate the constructive role that the
                Committee for Finance and Personnel has played and continues to
                play. On behalf of my Executive Colleagues, I want to ensure
                that it can continue to play and develop that constructive role,
                not just in its own interest but as an aid to the good work of
                other Committees. The Committee for Finance and Personnel has a
                pivotal role in ensuring that the Assembly gets proper
                consideration in regard to budget planning and implementation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Barnett formula falls outside the remit
                of the Bill per se. However, I assure the House that the
                Executive are well seized on that issue. Next year, in the
                context of the 2002 spending review, we will need to refine and
                articulate a strong case for revisions of the Barnett formula.
                It will not be a case of just asking the Treasury if it knows
                who is asking. There will be difficult issues, and the Executive
                are prepared to address them. The Executive hope that Members
                and Committees will be realistic about the difficulties and
                challenges that they face. Just as there are strong points to
                make, there are also strong points and questions that must be
                answered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point about the Barnett formula raises
                the issue of the adequacy of our budget, and many Members have
                touched on this, both today and on other occasions. As an
                Assembly we have already registered those questions. The
                Assembly needs to look not only at the question of whether it
                needs more money, but at the question of whether it needs to
                plan more wisely for the money that it has. Do we need more
                targeting for that money?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do we need more definitive strategies to
                underpin our spending plans? Do we need those strategies for the
                discrete spending decisions at departmental and ministerial
                level as well as for the Executive’s Determinations? I am
                concerned when there are many calls in the Assembly for more
                money rather than attempts being made to ensure that better use
                is made of the budget. We must remember that the information in
                the Budget (No 2) Bill and in the Estimates should not be
                referred to only as we go through the process of passing the
                Bill. Departmental Committees should use the information,
                together with the details in the public service agreements and
                the commitments in the Programme for Government, as they
                scrutinise the work of Departments during the year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Committees can scrutinise the work of
                Departments in many ways. There can be more monitoring of a
                Department’s performance. If there are questions about the
                quality of Estimates the most telling way to pursue the answers
                is not by considering the Budget or Budget (No 2) Bill; it is by
                looking at the scrutiny work that departmental Committees can
                undertake during the year. Committees can interest themselves in
                certain programmes and look at the related management,
                administrative and policy issues. In doing so, they can also
                examine the adequacy or accuracy of Estimates. The Executive
                have no problem with Committees taking such an interest.
                Committees should rightly interrogate spending plans at a
                departmental level, as well as in the wholesale context of
                Budget consideration at such times.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice raised many points that are well
                beyond the ambit of the Budget (No 2) Bill by nature of their
                detail. A Bill is coming forward concerning the children’s
                commissioner, and it is not my place to imply or suggest that
                anything that the Assembly might legislate for is pre-empted or
                predetermined by the Budget (No 2) Bill — it is not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Issues have been raised concerning the
                importance of statistics. I refer people with those concerns to
                my point that Committees should make sure that they impress
                their considerations on Departments to ensure better planning
                and targeting, which are necessary, because we need more robust
                statistics. The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency
                is trying to do that on several levels, and it responds to and
                takes on board the working requests of other Departments. We are
                trying to improve that situation, and if Committees can offer
                any insight into statistical gaps we will try to make good those
                gaps. We identified that problem in relation to the North/South
                statistical profile, which we published earlier this year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice asked what is being done to
                accommodate the Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee’s
                views on ‘Strategy 2010’ and certain tax considerations. Mr
                McGrady asked about tax-raising powers and the sensitive issues
                involved in such considerations. The points made by Ms Morrice
                gave rise to questions about the fact that some people are
                seeking tax-raising and tax-reducing powers.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are to consider more fiscal discretion
                or leverage for the Assembly, we must make sure that we join up
                our thinking on that. It will be very difficult for us to make a
                coherent case for any improvement in such capacity if we are
                saying continually that we will not levy any increases and that
                what we want, by way of intervening powers for ourselves in the
                fiscal regime, is simply the ability to offset or duck certain
                taxes. We must make sure that we not only do more as a joined-up
                Government but that we are ready to show that we are a grown-up
                Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The points about following through on ‘Strategy
                2010’, which raise questions about the impact of aspects of
                the fiscal regime, will be reflected by the Executive in their
                consideration with the Treasury and other devolved institutions
                of several matters in the fiscal regime — consideration that
                takes place at the Treasury’s request.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past we have reflected on fuel duties,
                aggregates tax and so on, and we will do so again — that will
                include tax breaks for creative industries. Those points will be
                made on behalf of the Executive, not just by me as Minister of
                Finance and Personnel, but by the Ministers with relevant
                sectoral interests, such as the Minister of Enterprise, Trade
                and Investment, Sir Reg Empey, or, in the case of creative
                industries, the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, Mr
                Michael McGimpsey. Those points will be pursued with the
                Treasury, not least by the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister, because it falls to them to represent and prosecute
                certain cases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat made useful points about the
                implications of resource accounting and budgeting. We must
                understand that we are dealing with a different system. We do
                not fully realise the implications of that. It will create some
                difficulties, but I am impressed by the way in which
                Departments, including my own, have managed the challenge of
                change to date.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must recognise that this will change the
                nature of the control that the Assembly will have. It gives us
                greater planning opportunities and greater planning challenges,
                because the Assembly will have more of the picture than it had
                before, as Mr Dallat said. Not only will the Assembly control
                spending, it will control the stock of assets. People have not
                fully realised the implications of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat’s remarks on the contribution of
                the Public Accounts Committee are well made, but it should not
                just be up to the Public Accounts Committee to examine post hoc
                whether expenditure was undertaken in the most proper,
                beneficial and effective manner. There is a considerable gap of
                activity, and that will enable departmental Committees to become
                involved. They will be able usefully to interrogate more of the
                operative spending practices of Departments than previously.
                That will not in any way detract from the work of the Public
                Accounts Committee. In many ways it will build upon much of the
                work and consolidate many of the pointers and useful principles
                that have been established by the Public Accounts Committee in
                relation to some programmes. However, we cannot cover them all,
                and I would like to see the various Committees taking up and
                amplifying some of the concerns that have been registered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was one question on accruing resources.
                It is difficult to understand what appropriations in aid are.
                Cash received by Departments, with the approval of the Assembly,
                is appropriated towards their gross expenditure plans.
                Appropriations in aid are receipts and income that come to
                Departments and are used in support of our wider Budget, and
                that is what we mean by accruing resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will refer points on individual spending
                programmes to the relevant Minister or write directly to Members
                on them. It would not be appropriate to go through all those
                points exhaustively because they are not necessarily appropriate
                to the Budget (No 2) Bill. I appreciate that some people missed
                the Supply motion last week because they had expected it to run
                into Tuesday, and I accept that some points have been saved from
                then and are being carried over now.</p>

                Department of Finance and Personnel has been required to draft
                the Order for the Secretary of State’s signature. The draft

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Order arises because the Planning Appeals

                transferred from the Department of the Environment to the Office
                of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Planning Appeals Commission deals with
                appeals against decisions of the Department of the Environment’s
                Planning Service. Under the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order
                1991 and the Water and Sewerage Services (Northern Ireland)
                Order 1973, the Department of the Environment has
                responsibilities relating to, for example, the remuneration
                allowance of the commissioners of the Planning Appeals
                Commission and the Water Appeals Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Water Appeals Commission comprises the
                four most senior members of the Planning Appeals Commission. It
                deals with appeals in regard to the work and responsibilities of
                the Department of the Environment, the Department of Agriculture
                and Rural Development, the Department of Culture, Arts and
                Leisure and the Department for Regional Development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of the Environment has been
                considering the appropriateness of its role in regard to those
                appellate bodies for some time. However, since the introduction
                of the Human Rights Act 1998 in Northern Ireland it has been
                examining its functions more closely to ensure its compliance
                with the 1998 Act and the European Convention on Human Rights.
                The Department was satisfied that the Planning Appeals
                Commission and the Water Appeals Commission are entirely
                independent and impartial. However, it recognised — as did we
                — that the current statutory arrangements could create a
                perception that the commissioners are not fully independent. For
                that reason, and with Mr Foster’s agreement, the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister proposes to acquire
                the sponsorship functions of the Department of the Environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed transfer will provide these
                appellate bodies with more robust and transparent levels of
                independence and impartiality. The transfers would be effected
                under article 4(3) of the Departments (Transfer of Functions)
                Order (Northern Ireland) 2001. The functions under the Planning
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 that would be transferred from the
                Department of the Environment to the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister would include powers to
                appoint commissioners to the Planning Appeals Commission and to
                determine their remuneration and allowances. The Office of the
                First Minster and the Deputy First Minister would also be
                granted powers to appoint staff to assist the commission in
                performing its functions, to determine their remuneration and
                allowances, and to determine remuneration allowances for any
                assessor appointed by the chief commissioner to assist at
                hearings. It would also acquire powers to make rules for
                regulating the procedure for proceedings before the commission
                and to prescribe fees in respect of commission applications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is proposed to transfer the functions
                contained in the Water and Sewerage Services (Northern Ireland)
                Order 1973 that provide for the appointment of the chief
                commissioner and other commissioners of the Water Appeals
                Commission, the payment of commissioners and those appointed to
                assist the commission. The four most senior members of the
                Planning Appeals Commission act jointly as commissioners of the
                Water Appeals Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A consultation role in the appointment by the
                chief commissioner of an assessor to sit with the member of the
                commission at an appeal or hearing would also be transferred to
                the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minster.
                There would also be provision to approve the payment by the
                commission of fees and allowances to an assessor and to make
                rules to regulate commission procedure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of those functions currently fall to the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Department
                for Regional Development and the Department of Culture, Arts and
                Leisure, where these Departments have an interest in a water
                appeals hearing. Mrs Rodgers, Mr Campbell and Mr McGimpsey have
                agreed to the transfer of those functions to the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, as outlined in
                articles 8, 9 and 10 of the Order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The transfers of several other functions are
                set out in the Order. In February 1999, the Assembly approved an
                earlier report by the First Minister Designate and the Deputy
                First Minister Designate setting out details about certain
                functions of the 11 Departments in the Northern Ireland
                Administration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The principal Departments (Transfer and
                Assignment of Functions) Order (Northern Ireland) 1999, which
                implemented the agreed structures, was enacted in December 1999.
                Since its enactment, Departments have identified several
                statutory functions that must be transferred to other
                Departments to create consistency with the agreed allocation of
                functions at that time. The opportunity is now being taken to
                enact those transfers.</p>

                of Functions) Order (Northern Ireland) 2001 will transfer
                functions relating to the payment of expenses of the North/South
                Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council and the Civic
                Forum from the Department of Finance and Personnel to the Office
                of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. While the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                supports the operation of the North/South Ministerial Council,
                the British-Irish Council and the Civic Forum, the Northern
                Ireland Act 1998 provides that expenses in respect of these
                functions are defrayed as Department of Finance and Personnel
                expenses. That will be addressed and corrected by article 3.
                When the Northern Ireland Act 1998 was drafted, the Office of
                the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister did not exist.
                The Order before the Assembly would regularise that position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the functions being transferred
                from the Department of the Environment to the Department of
                Finance and Personnel come under article 4(1) of the Departments
                (Transfer of Functions) Order (Northern Ireland) 2001. These
                transfers are necessary because of the distribution of functions
                under the principal 1999 Order. They relate to functions
                conferred on the Department of the Environment under social
                security legislation that deals with rate fraud in housing
                benefit claims.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, the opportunity has been taken in
                article 4(2) to transfer several provisions from the Department
                of the Environment to the Department for Regional Development.
                Those provisions properly fall in the remit of the Department
                for Regional Development; they relate mainly to its
                responsibility for public transport and its obligations as a
                public roads authority for Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fourthly, article 5 of the Order transfers
                functions from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment to the Department of Finance and Personnel. This
                relates to the appointment of a committee to advise Departments
                on the exercise of functions under the Statistics of Trade and
                Employment (Northern Ireland) Order 1988. That committee is
                currently appointed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment, and the focus of its work is predominantly economic
                and business statistics. This degree of specialism is reflected
                in the membership of the committee. While current legislation
                makes provision for Departments other than the Department of
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment to consult the committee on
                matters related to the collection and quality of general
                statistical information, this facility has not been widely used.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A committee appointed by the Department of
                Finance and Personnel will retain the statutory functions as
                currently detailed in the legislation relating to business
                statistics, and it will act in an independent advisory capacity
                to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency — an
                agency of the Department of Finance and Personnel. Given the
                agency’s position as the host body for all Northern Ireland
                Civil Service statisticians and its role in quality-assuring
                their work, it is appropriate for the new committee to develop
                its role beyond pure statistics or business statistics.
                Therefore, its remit will span the statistical material of all
                Departments, as well as covering more fundamental issues such as
                quality assurance, a statistics code of practice and national
                statistics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fifthly, article 6 of the Order transfers
                certain functions under the Pension Schemes (Northern Ireland)
                Act 1993 from the Department for Social Development to the
                Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and
                Employment. This relates to the payment of contributions when an
                employer becomes insolvent. As those payments are infrequent, it
                has only recently come to light that in consequence of earlier
                legislation on the consolidation of pensions, the function is
                more appropriate to — and should have been transferred to —
                the Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and
                Employment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My sixth point deals with article 7 of the
                Order, which carries some minor transfer from the Department of
                Education to the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure. This
                relates to library and recreational matters consistent with the
                transfer of library services, recreation and cultural activity
                functions from the Department of Education to the Department of
                Culture, Arts and Leisure in the principal 1999 Order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, article 11 of the Order makes
                legislative changes consequential upon the transfers. The Order
                has been scrutinised by the Committee of the Centre and the
                Examiner of Statutory Rules. All Ministers concerned in these
                transfers have been consulted and are content. I hope that
                Members will support these measures.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee of
                the Centre (Mr Gibson):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee of the Centre considered this
                Statutory Rule at Consultation Stage and Statutory Rule Stage.
                The junior Minister has outlined in detail the various transfers
                of functions from one Department to another. The Order was
                presented to us as a tidying-up exercise following the creation
                of the 11 new Departments and the establishment of devolution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As outlined earlier by the junior Minister,
                the area of greatest concern to the Committee was the transfer
                of the Planning Appeals Commission and the Water Appeals
                Commission to the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister. We were told that this was to allow for greater
                independence. Currently the Department of the Environment has
                statutory responsibility for the Planning Appeals Commission,
                and the four most senior planning appeals commissioners comprise
                the Water Appeals Commission. Therefore, the appellate bodies
                were examining the decisions of the Department that had the
                statutory responsibility for them. While we were assured that
                they acted independently in that arrangement, this transfer
                creates a more open and accountable form of impartiality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee questioned whether these
                important appeal bodies would have been better set up outside
                the central Government structure to provide them with even more
                independence and impartiality. However, the Government had
                already announced a review of public administration, and the
                Committee decided that this matter should be taken on board in
                that review. All forms of appeals in our administrative system
                should be seen not only as apparently independent, but as very
                obviously independent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The junior Minister dealt with the 11
                transfer functions which relate to Departments other than the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. The
                Committee of the Centre consulted with the other relevant
                Assembly Committees and got assurances on the points of concern
                that were raised. The junior Ministers attended the Committee of
                the Centre and positively answered the questions that had caused
                concern. Therefore, the Committee of the Centre is fairly and
                reasonably satisfied that it can recommend that this Statutory
                Rule be accepted and affirmed.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received no further indication of
                Members who would like to speak.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome Mr Gibson’s comment that he is
                fairly and reasonably satisfied. If anyone says to anyone else
                here that he is fairly and reasonably satisfied, that can be
                taken as a commendation. Mr Gibson rightly said, as did I at the
                outset, that the main thrust of this transfer of functions is to
                deal with the Planning Appeals Commission and the Water Appeals
                Commission. There are others coming through as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While satisfied that both commissions are
                entirely independent and impartial, this provides a greater
                outward display of that impartiality. It remains for me to thank
                Mr Gibson on behalf of the Committee that he represents for his
                words of support. I ask that the motion to approve these
                provisions be supported.</p>

                asked questions about matters that were not his responsibility.
                They were occasioned less by their appropriateness as questions
                to that Minister than by the events of the recent elections. As
                the Deputy Speaker ruled at that time, such questions are out of
                order. They should not be put, and, if put, the Minister should
                not be required to respond.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Speaker of the House of Commons of
                Canada, the hon Peter Milliken, and several of his parliamentary
                Colleagues have visited us today, and some Members have had an
                opportunity to meet them. It is an honour for the Assembly not
                only to receive distinguished parliamentarians, but, for the
                first time since it decided to join the Commonwealth

                Alastair Campbell, who said that the days of the bog-standard
                comprehensive school were over? Does the Minister agree that
                there is little point in copying an experiment in England that
                experts agreed failed between 1971 and 1999?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I noted those comments when they were made.
                The Department of Education has put in place a wide-ranging
                review. The Gallagher and Smith Report provided information on
                education in England, Scotland and some European countries. The
                review body and the panel of education advisors have substantial
                knowledge of these matters. The review body has undertaken study
                visits to the South, Scotland, the Netherlands and Austria to
                experience their systems at first hand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be a serious mistake to pre-empt the
                outcome of the review body’s deliberations. An extensive
                consultation is taking place, and, as a result of the
                information that I have received from the review body and its
                trips abroad, I am certain that it is taking a broad view of all
                this.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that when considering
                comprehensive education he would do well to examine the concept
                of community schools that exists in the Republic of Ireland? Not
                only are they comprehensive, but they are open to the whole
                community, thereby promoting lifelong learning.</p>

                schools.</p>

                as to how all this will turn out, but I do not know how it will
                turn out, because the review body is independent. It has been
                involved in in-depth discussions on many education systems, and
                I am as keenly interested as Mr Dallat in the outcome of its

                considering the extension of the deadline until later in the

                Department to put this in place as early as possible at the
                beginning of next year. Any delay would be highly detrimental,
                as we are dealing with the sense of unfairness and inequities

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regard this as an urgent priority — an
                objective to be achieved as quickly as possible. This has put
                people under pressure. It has put many officials in my
                Department under pressure, and by extending the period of
                consultation I have made their lives much more difficult. We are

                specific human rights issues have been identified. Under my
                Department’s New TSN action plan, a working group was
                established some time ago to consider the promotion of access to
                schools by disadvantaged groups, with particular reference to
                the operation of admissions criteria.</p>

                report will issue from the Department to schools in late August
                as specific advice for the review of admissions criteria. My
                Department will also be undertaking an equality impact
                assessment of the open enrolment policy in 2002-03 under its
                statutory equality scheme. The whole system of post- primary
                provision is currently under review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department is aware of these important
                issues and is taking appropriate action. I should also stress
                that admissions criteria are statutorily matters for boards of

                human rights issues identified in the commission’s report.
                Given that this matter is urgent and accepting that it is for
                boards of governors to implement, can the Minister say how
                quickly he expects to issue any revised guidance in the light of
                that report? Will he be taking any further action so that the
                admission of pupils who are neither Catholic nor Protestant to
                integrated schools is treated more fairly than at present?</p>

                settle these matters. We should not exaggerate the extent of the
                problems we face. Generally, boards of governors take great care
                in drawing up and applying their criteria, and they exercise
                their responsibilities very conscientiously. We must ensure that
                any problems identified are resolved in the future, and that
                includes the problem with integrated schools. We are monitoring
                the situation carefully, but we must keep the problems in

                issues, and doubtless many Members receive communications from
                their constituents, particularly in the aftermath of the results
                of the 11-plus examinations. We have tried to deal with the
                problem by establishing the working party. That was a positive
                development, and we await the outcome of it. The advice will
                issue to schools in August, and I hope that we can overcome many

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I first came to the Department of
                Education, I stressed the importance of parental choice and of
                ensuring that we allow for the demand for education in relation
                to particular sections of the community, whether in the
                integrated, Irish-medium or any other sector. We said that we
                would do everything in our power, as long as people came forward
                with robust proposals. On the specific issue of applications for
                the establishment of new schools, we have been at pains to
                ensure that there has been no favouritism for anybody and that
                people’s rights have been protected. At all times the
                Department has ensured that it adhered rigidly to its criteria
                for the establishment of new schools or the continuation of
                schools that were under threat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that Members’ minds may, for

                were down to ask questions were not in the Chamber when their
                time came. In addition, any Members who may have wished to ask
                supplementary questions were denied the opportunity to do so.
                Although that may be a discourtesy and a disadvantage to the
                House, it is also a discourtesy to the Minister and his civil
                servants, who have taken substantial time to prepare responses
                to the questions. Frankly, that is not the way in which the

                labhair Gníomhaireacht an Chaomhnóra ad Litem ó seoladh í i
                mí na Samhna 1996 go héifeachtach ar son páistí sa dlí

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am satisfied that the Guardian Ad Litem
                Agency, since its launch in November 1996, has provided an
                essential voice for the child in public law and adoption

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To clarify, I should explain that I have
                carried out the duties of guardian ad litem as an employee of a
                health and social services board, though it is not an interest
                to declare. It seems that with the setting up of the agency,
                there is now less consistency in the work of individual
                guardians, and they may take different attitudes in accordance
                with their professional judgement. I would not wish guardians to
                be in the same position as, perhaps, psychiatrists or doctors,
                by finding that they disagree with each other in court. To
                ensure consistency, is there not a case for considering greater
                regulation of the way the entire panel works?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each case is unique and must be treated on
                its merits. It is ultimately for the court to determine the
                action to be taken, based on the evidence before it and its
                assessment of the Guardian Ad Litem Agency’s recommendations.
                The Social Services Inspectorate is empowered to carry out
                inspections of the agency to ensure that its services adhere to
                acceptable standards and that it continues to satisfy
                legislative and departmental requirements. The Social Services
                Inspectorate will shortly plan its business programme for the
                next five years. Together with the Department’s childcare
                unit, it will consider whether there is a need to include an
                inspection of the Guardian Ad Litem Agency during the planning
                cycle. I am informed that the courts value highly the work of
                the Guardian Ad Litem Agency; it is my assessment that they are
                satisfied with the agency’s work.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Hayes Report has outraged most of the
                residents of County Tyrone. Most of the area covered by
                Cookstown, Dungannon, Omagh and Strabane district councils has
                been marginalised. Accessibility and availability of services
                are not properly provided for in the Hayes Report because of the
                decline of Tyrone County Hospital. Will the Minister and her
                associates show serious concern during the consultation period
                for the residents’ heartfelt outrage? It will not disappear
                until their demands are met.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is a frank assessment of the
                problems that face our hospital services, and it underlines the
                need for the problems to be confronted. Everyone who is affected
                by the report should take time to study it carefully, and
                everyone will have an opportunity to make his or her views
                known. It is important to stress that no decisions have been or
                will be taken prior to a period of consultation. Any changes
                that are proposed for the long-term future of our acute
                hospitals will be subject to an equality impact assessment. I
                agree that the question of access to acute hospital services is
                a matter of crucial interest, and I reiterate that everyone will
                have an opportunity to make their views known.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Hayes Report on acute services has caused
                immense disquiet and anger in Omagh and west Tyrone. The
                recommendation flies in the face of all logical factors involved
                in medical care provision. What comfort and consideration can
                the Minister offer the staff and, in particular, the patients of
                the Tyrone County Hospital who have genuine fears about the
                future of acute services provision in west Tyrone?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the light of the Hayes Report that has
                just been published, does the Minister agree that the proposals
                of the working party regarding the provision of services in
                Downe Hospital — the Stewart Report — should have been
                implemented? The Minister placed a moratorium on the building of
                the new hospital in Downpatrick approximately a year and a half
                ago. She suspended the architectural work and placed a
                moratorium on the procurement of equipment for the new hospital.
                Does she not agree that she should now lift those moratoria? The
                new hospital buildings will cater for whatever services will go
                into them. Two years have already been lost, and it is
                absolutely disgraceful that medical, surgical and nursing staff
                are expected to work in the archaic conditions that now exist in
                the Downe Hospital.</p>

                I will advance proposals for agreement by the Executive, with a

                traditional approach of publicly-funded investment has been

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am happy to confirm the thrust of that. As
                the Executive emphasised in the Programme for Government,
                resources available from taxpayers are finite and stretched by
                the need to provide services to meet levels of need that are
                greater than the UK average. The Executive have also had to deal
                with a legacy of historical underfunding in the infrastructure
                of our public services, which means that education, for example,
                has a backlog of capital investment needs of around £500
                million. That simply cannot be funded in the traditional manner
                with the resources available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is therefore important that the Executive
                and the Departments explore new ways of financing public
                services such as PFI/PPP. Where this is employed, it is
                invariably because the traditional investment approach has been
                considered but has been judged to be unaffordable from available
                resources. PFI/PPP is used to address real needs, but only if
                deals with private- sector partners are affordable and
                demonstrably deliver value for money.</p>

                part of the remit of the new working group to consult with other
                Departments and particularly to look at other innovative schemes
                for funding the investment deficit such as bond schemes, which
                are being examined by at least one Department?</p>

                opportunities to provide public services and maximise the amount
                of investment that takes place in the public interest. We must
                keep underscoring that we are trying to maximise the amount of
                investment in the public interest, and we are talking about the
                provision of better public services for the longer term. That

                not going to be as straightforward as some of their sponsors
                necessarily believe, so the working group will have to address

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can confirm that. Public procurement is
                first and foremost the means by which the public sector buys in
                the goods and services that it needs to discharge its
                responsibilities to the citizens. Securing commercial value for
                money is an important consideration. With well over
                £1&nbsp;billion a year being spent, not only might savings be
                possible but that activity has the potential to have a
                significant impact on the social and economic environment. For
                that reason, the review team has, as part of its terms of
                reference, the task of exploring the scope to use public
                procurement to further social, economic and environmental
                objectives in the context of current EC and international law
                relating to procurement. I look forward to its findings and
                recommendations.</p>

                been directly affected and are suffering financial hardship as a
                direct result of the foot-and-mouth disease crisis. Businesses
                that fall into that category in west Tyrone should be availing
                of that scheme. The tests that have been introduced —
                including being able to show a 15% drop in turnover — are
                neither complicated nor exacting. I hope that as many Members as

                to over 1,200 groups and individuals listed in the equality

                dedicated equine establishments with a view to redressing the
                direct competition that they experience from farms operating
                subsidiary equine businesses, but which pay no rates.</p>

                addressed in the rating policy review, which is under way. All

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister take the view that
                levelling rates is a primitive and crude method of raising
                revenue and that, as in certain states in the United States of
                America, local purchase taxes and income taxes, which reflect
                more accurately an individual’s ability to pay, are a fairer
                way of raising revenue? Will he undertake to consider that?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the context of the rating policy review,
                we are trying to make sure that we have a means of raising
                revenue that is efficient in giving a good yield but fair in the
                burdens it imposes on households and businesses. The Member
                referred to direct taxes, including some examples of states in
                the USA, but direct taxes of various kinds can be as unpopular
                and at times as crude and simplistic as he thinks that rating
                policy is.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity
                to make a statement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Tuesday 6 May, four weeks before the
                general election and six weeks before the meeting of the Ulster
                Unionist Council, the First Minister announced his intention to
                resign from office on 1 July if decommissioning did not take
                place. Owing to the results of the general election and the
                local council elections and the success of anti- agreement
                candidates, it is clear that the First Minister has no option
                but to resign.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To make that gesture meaningful, all Unionist
                Ministers ought to resign with him. To do otherwise would be to
                reduce the actions of the First Minister to a stunt — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. Members on all sides — at least
                those with any experience — ought to be aware that personal
                statements are heard in silence. I ask that this convention be
                observed. It has not always been observed in the Chamber, but
                Members should adhere to it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To do otherwise would be to reduce the
                actions of the First Minister to a stunt, the result of which
                would be to see further concessions made to Republicans over the
                summer on policing, amnesties for on-the-run terrorists and
                demilitarisation. All Members must be acutely aware that that
                will be the inevitable consequence if the First Minister alone
                resigns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague Maurice Morrow and I have
                therefore today tendered to the Speaker a letter of resignation
                effective on the resignation of all the First Minister’s party
                Colleagues from the Executive.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members:</p>
                </b>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That action, together with the election
                results, will send out the clearest possible signal that the
                current system does not command the support of a majority of
                Unionists in Northern Ireland. The DUP is committed to finding
                an accommodation that can command such support and in pursuing
                that aim it will talk to any democratic party. However, it will
                not sit down or negotiate with those who are not committed to
                exclusively peaceful means. The DUP will not act in a way that
                will simply hand over Departments to those who support the
                Belfast Agreement; it will act in the best interests of all the
                people of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today we challenge the First Minister to see
                if he is serious about decommissioning and give him the
                opportunity to take a decisive and meaningful step. The process
                has reached a moment of truth, and the First Minister can halt
                the concessions to Republicans that may be made over the summer
                months. I challenge him to act now. Let him heed the will of the
                Unionist electorate and prevent a further wave of capitulation
                and concessions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time to unify Unionism behind a
                position that can command the support of the majority of
                Unionists. This is an opportunity that Unionism can ill afford
                to miss. Mr Morrow and I remain ready to divulge the precise
                terms of our letter as and when the First Minister does
                likewise. <i>[Interruption].</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I advised the House on 8 May, the occasion
                of a previous personal statement, this statement will be made
                under the precedent of a statement made on 15 July 1999. When
                Ministers make statements about their personal position that
                affect public office, an opportunity may be given to other party
                leaders or their nominees to make comment or response to them.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am astonished by some of the comments that
                have been made by Mr Campbell. He appears to be in some doubt as
                to what the letter I lodged with the Speaker says. If there is
                any problem I will publish the letter. It contains one sentence.
                It is absolutely clear in what it contains and what its effects
                will be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Behind the fog of language that we heard from
                Mr Campbell two things stand out. First, he is incompetent; he
                has not read the Northern Ireland Act 1998. The letter he has
                lodged will have no effect. A letter of resignation — if he
                can read the Northern Ireland Act — should be sent to the
                Deputy First Minister and myself. Sending a resignation letter
                to the Speaker has no effect at all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, he is a coward, he is a political
                coward. If he had any courage he would go now. What is he going
                to do? He says —<i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He says that after I resign he might think
                about it. In other words he is content to follow me, and by
                saying that, he is showing that he and his party regard me as
                the leader of Unionism.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. Normally it is the case that when
                there is disturbance it is in the Galleries, and they may be
                cleared. If the House will not settle there will be little point
                in continuing with this.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell described the First Minister’s
                resignation letter and any implementation of it as a
                &quot;stunt&quot;. Mr Campbell and Mr Morrow seem to be offering
                what might at best be described as a &quot;shadow stunt&quot;.
                They &quot;may&quot; resign if other Ministers resign following
                Mr Trimble’s resignation. It seems to me that they are
                suggesting that all the Unionist Ministers should take the same
                step and the same moves in a manner that I think is dangerously
                close to a political form of line dancing. I would have thought
                that on that basis the DUP Ministers might reconsider what they
                are offering.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For some time it has been clear to many of us
                outside Unionism that there are two groups of people on David
                Trimble’s back: those within his party are there because they
                are trying to bring him down; and those from the DUP are there
                because they are quite happy to piggyback on David Trimble and
                on the success and the workings of the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet again, we have an indication from the DUP
                of their attempt to talk up their stance, and how they are out
                to break or undermine the agreement, while at the same time
                taking care to shelter themselves within the office of the
                agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The non-statement from Mr Campbell and the
                very obvious non-statement by Mr Morrow, or &quot;Mr
                Ditto&quot;, show that the DUP, in spite of its hype about its
                mandate, has no agenda now that the election is over.</p>

                raving, and to see his attitude — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

                best described as what the scriptures call &quot;a
                creeper&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me make it clear that Mr Durkan, who
                seems also to be enraged, remembers a day in the House when they
                were kissing him, congratulating him and patting him on the
                shoulder because he had been elected to office in the Assembly.
                Who was it who brought him down? It was not the gentlemen
                sitting on those Benches, who were hiding away in Glengall
                Street. It was I and this party behind me who brought the mighty
                man down. If anyone suggests that my party is interested in
                office rather than principle, that proves that it is not. If we
                had been interested in office we could have taken the best
                offices in the House. That is a fact of history that cannot be
                gainsaid.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What has happened today is this: the bluff of
                the First Minister and his fellow travellers who are trying to
                fool the public that they can stay in power when he goes has
                been called. We know that when he goes, they have to go. Why do
                they not do it decently and let every Unionist worth his name
                and who has any interest in defeating Republicanism and the IRA
                resign? <i>[Interruption].</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are not prepared to put Republicans into
                office, as the party that is mumbling would be very glad to do.
                The moment of decision and of truth has come, and if these men
                were Unionists they would get out and stay out.</p>

                &quot;No surrender&quot; catchphrase of Unionism; now we hear
                surrender. The message from broad Nationalism and Republicanism
                is that yes, there are problems, but we can resolve them through
                dialogue, negotiation and commitment to politics. I direct that

                is that if we measure the progress of the last few years against
                our collective experience of political failure, there is only
                one option. That option is to continue on this path, take our
                courage in our hands and exercise the mandate we received to
                deliver peace and democracy through negotiation, agreement and
                mutual respect. We will then solve the outstanding problems of
                militarisation and policing in our society, the criminal justice
                review and, yes, the question of arms. We will resolve those
                problems by agreement and by applying ourselves in a diligent,
                sensible fashion. Those who set ultimatums and unrealistically
                expect that we can solve the problems of generations in a matter
                of months betray the expectations of those who voted for the

                into believing that they are not going to make the Assembly
                work, when even the dogs in the street know that they are

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it not sad that those who signed up to the
                agreement have brought the whole democratic process in Northern
                Ireland into disrepute with what is taking place in the Chamber
                today? We are being treated to nothing more sophisticated than a
                political game of chicken played by the Ulster Unionist Party
                and the DUP. They have no mandate to remain in the House for one
                more minute, because they presented themselves to the electorate
                on the basis of &quot;no guns, no Government&quot; and total
                opposition to the Belfast Agreement and its institutions. They
                stated clearly that they would not have terrorists in
                Government. The only fact is Mr McGuinness’s statement — at
                the beginning of the negotiations in Castle Buildings that
                brought this whole sordid process into being — that there
                would be no guns before, during or after the negotiations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble may issue post-dated resignations,
                and the DUP may mimic that move, but the only people who have
                stuck to their guns are those represented by Sinn Féin on the
                other side of the Chamber. Fifty-nine percent of the electorate
                cast their votes on the basis of Mr Trimble’s promise that he
                would resign, and on the DUP’s promise to smash the agreement.
                The electorate voted against terrorists in Government. However,
                they are sitting in the Chamber and will continue to sit in the
                Executive for as long as they wish to do so.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful that I am able to bring this
                important motion to the Assembly for debate in order to
                highlight the problem of alcohol consumption in public places,
                alcohol abuse by young people under the age of 18, and the
                problems of overindulgence. Many of my constituents in the small
                towns and villages of Fermanagh and South Tyrone — especially
                in Moy, County Tyrone — have seen these problems at first
                hand. They have endured weekend after weekend of alcohol-
                related disturbances with severe loss to their quality of life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not condemn people for enjoying alcohol
                when they are responsible and aware of other people’s rights.
                Each weekend, many people enjoy a drink responsibly and without
                impinging on the rights of others, either on their person or
                their property. Most are sensible enough to go home by taxi or
                with someone who has not imbibed alcohol. I commend groups that
                socialise together and organise rotas with a designated
                non-drinking driver.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a tolerant society people should be aware
                that there are consequences for breaking the law. Laws are not
                made to restrict but to protect. I am concerned about young
                people who drink to excess, drink in public places, create a
                nuisance, drop litter or damage and destroy property.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned about the high incidence
                of under-age drinking, which ensures a continuing culture of
                irresponsible use of alcohol. In 1999, the European School
                Survey Project on Alcohol and other Drugs (ESPAD) involving 15-
                to 18-year-old students showed that the United Kingdom and the
                Republic of Ireland shared the dubious distinction of being in
                the top four European nations of students who had been drunk 10
                times or more during the 12 months preceding the survey, and of
                students who reported binge drinking three times or more during
                the 30 days previous to the survey. Binge drinking is defined as
                having five or more drinks at a time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surprisingly, the wine-drinking countries
                such as France, Italy and others in the Mediterranean area
                report the lowest incidences of such behaviour. It is important
                that parents encourage their children to have a responsible
                attitude towards the use of alcohol. Lessons in high schools and
                grammar schools on the effects of alcohol could help to combat
                the growing under-age drinking culture.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A recent UK-wide study by Dr Martin Plant of
                the Edinburgh-based Alcohol and Health Research Centre found
                that 75% of children aged between 15 and 16 admitted that they
                had been drunk. The study also shows that one in four deaths of
                young men are alcohol-related. The charity Alcohol Concern, in
                response to the study, called for tighter enforcement of
                under-age drinking laws, by saying:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We just want to see the existing laws
                enforced properly when they have been broken by people selling
                alcohol to under-age drinkers.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the World Health Organisation conference
                in Stockholm in February this year, EU Commissioner David Byrne
                said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;My key message on delivering change on
                alcohol and youth is the three Es: enforcement, enforcement and
                more enforcement.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Law enforcement could be combined with a
                considered approach by the Government to address how the drinks
                industry aggressively markets alcoholic products.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The drinks industry is very experienced at
                focusing on particular target groups, and the introduction of
                alcopops shows that there can be only one conclusion as to what
                group the industry was targeting and appealing to. One drinks
                company even undertook market research on women’s attitudes to
                discover how to make bottled beer more attractive to females.
                The end result was an easier-to-hold bottle and a thicker label
                for women to peel off. Needless to say, sales improved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What can be done? Is more legislation
                necessary? Yes. An immediate start can be made with the
                enforcement of existing laws and by-laws. Even if the Assembly
                produced new legislation, any law is useless unless it is
                enforced. The abysmal failure of existing by-laws to control
                public and under-age drinking stems from the inability of either
                district councils or the RUC to enforce them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">District councils have powers to create
                by-laws under the Local Government Act 1972. Each of the 26
                councils in Northern Ireland is responsible for its alcohol
                by-laws.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are 26 council areas and 26 different
                ways to apply alcohol by-laws. This inconsistency was
                highlighted by a review of the operation of alcohol by-laws in
                Northern Ireland that was presented to my local council —
                Dungannon and South Tyrone — by its director last year. As
                part of that study, responses were received from 21 councils.
                The findings showed that the enforcement of alcohol by-laws in
                Northern Ireland is at best patchy and at worst non-existent. It
                is a lengthy and costly process for a local council, under an
                existing by-law, to designate a street, a village or a town as
                an alcohol-free zone. Legislation is required to make it simpler
                for new areas to be added to a schedule attached to the existing
                by-laws. However, serious consideration should be given to the
                introduction of Northern Ireland-wide legislation to create a
                consistent approach to tackling alcohol abuse in public areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an urgent need to clarify the
                relationship between the local authorities and the police.
                Responsibility for the by-laws and prosecution lies with the
                councils. Detection of the offence is the responsibility of the
                police. That division creates a weakness in tackling a serious
                issue. Local authorities are concerned that the police do not
                pursue rigorous detection of offences. Conversely, there are
                reduced detection rates by the police due to the lack of
                commitment by some councils to proceed with prosecutions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem of the enforcement of alcohol
                by-laws is exacerbated when many inebriated persons are gathered
                together. There is also a high cost, with local policing
                resources tied up to control public disorder. For example, on a
                typical Friday or Saturday night the police in a small town with
                licensed premises would be on alert for three to five hours,
                with possibly half of a divisional mobile support unit having to
                be drafted in to cope with the numbers. The approximate cost,
                totalling man-hours, local resources and extra units, is
                £250,000 a year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must also be noted that 60% of
                alcohol-related disturbances happen in the vicinity of licensed
                premises and that 16- to 24-year-old males are the highest risk
                group for alcohol-related violent crime. There is currently no
                legislation to enable the police to seize alcohol which is being
                consumed in public, except from young persons under the age of
                18.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is ambiguity about the use of the word
                &quot;consumption&quot;. Persons in possession of an open
                container of alcohol in a public place are not committing an
                offence. Prosecution can only take place if persons are observed
                consuming the liquid. The current legislation should be changed
                to allow a charge of possession with intent to consume alcohol.
                The police must be given the power to detect and prosecute those
                guilty of such an offence. That could take the form of fixed
                penalties and the power to confiscate alcohol. The police would
                then have the information on alcohol-related offences to
                maintain an up-to-date record and to provide continuing
                monitoring data. These records would merit inclusion in the
                police performance indicators for annual appraisal in each
                council area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a real need to review the operation
                and application of alcohol by-laws in Northern Ireland. A single
                accountable body should be made responsible for enforcement and
                the prosecution of offenders. Logically, that body should be the
                police.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very difficult for the police to
                identify young persons who are under age and drinking alcohol.
                We all know that young persons now dress in as mature a manner
                as possible and look far older than they really are. An approved
                identity card scheme would go a long way to preventing young
                people under the age of 18 from obtaining alcohol.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It could take the form of a card that could
                be produced before purchasing alcohol from licensed premises or
                before entering a licensed establishment. After the production
                of approved documentation giving proof of age, local authorities
                could provide young people with free identification cards. To
                reduce fraud, the cards could be bar-coded or marked with a
                hologram.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An accredited scheme for training bar staff,
                door staff and staff in licensed premises, as set out in the
                document on the strategy for reducing alcohol-related harm,
                would be welcomed and should be implemented as soon as possible.
                The scheme could be co-ordinated by councils, but with
                centralised direction to ensure consistent standards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must pursue a Northern Ireland-wide
                education programme to alert younger people to the dangers of
                under-age drinking. I welcome the inclusion of that proposal in
                the strategy document. To ensure a consistent delivery of the
                education programme, it should be provided under the direction
                of the joint action group on drugs and alcohol.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer again to the statistics for the
                United Kingdom in the ESPAD document. They show that young
                people — 15- to 16-year-olds — who use alcohol admitted to
                poor educational performance, to having accidents, to being
                injury prone, to having poor relationships with their parents,
                to becoming involved in scuffles and fights and to having
                unprotected sex after drinking. That last point is especially
                worrying: in Northern Ireland, there are many teenage
                pregnancies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alcohol-related disturbances, typically
                involving young men, are costing Northern Ireland dearly. The
                estimated total cost of alcohol-related harm for 1997-98 is
                £777 million. That is horrendous. Think of what could be done
                with that money; it could be much better used.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy for reducing alcohol-related
                harm that was launched by the Department of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety is a positive attempt to tackle
                alcohol abuse. It will have an impact on the two areas that I
                have spoken about today. I welcome the announcement that there
                will be joint implementation of the alcohol and drugs
                strategies, although such joint implementation requires adequate
                resources. The work of the RUC is an integral part of the
                strategy, and that fact should be openly accepted. The police
                have to control public disturbances and deal with other offences
                resulting from alcohol misuse. There is an urgent need for a
                review of the alcohol by-laws in Northern Ireland. The required
                resources should be forthcoming.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Member on bringing this
                matter to the attention of the Assembly. We are only too aware
                of the increase in alcohol-related crime, including not only
                attacks on individuals but attacks on property, cars and
                businesses. Doctors in accident and emergency departments are
                constantly dealing with injuries resulting from domestic
                violence that is fuelled by drink or drugs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alcohol is the most abused drug but because
                it is socially acceptable it is seldom seem as such. Often, a
                blind eye is turned to alcohol abuse. Most major cities have
                by-laws that address the problem of outdoor drinking. The
                enforcement of those laws by local authorities is the difficult
                part. Council officers must go to court to prosecute. The police
                arrest individuals and gather evidence, but local councils must
                decide whether to prosecute.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the main problems in the area covered
                by my local authority — Derry City Council — is that it is
                often the habitual drinker — or wino — who is brought to
                court. The fine is derisory, but bringing the case to court is
                expensive, and it is time-consuming for council officers.
                Frequently, the offenders who should have been brought before
                the court are missed. If they are charged, the courts often show
                leniency, and the offences continue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By-laws must apply to designated areas, and a
                blanket ban is unenforceable without adequate resources. Glasgow
                has such a policy, but in my area it was felt that this policy
                would not work. Support for such a policy must come not only
                from the community but from the police. If more resources were
                available to councils they could employ officers to enforce the
                policy and bring perpetrators of drink-related crime to court.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By-laws can be easily overcome by moving
                on-street drinkers to another area where they can laugh at those
                trying to enforce the policy — which often happens. The
                support of statutory agencies such as the education and library
                boards, health and social services boards and those involved in
                the treatment of young alcoholics is necessary if we are to
                raise the awareness of the public and get its support. That is
                why I support the motion and ask for the legislation to be
                amended and more resources to be made available. A Province-wide
                education programme is needed to address the problem once and
                for all, and we must make the by-laws and legislation adequate.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson, who moved the motion, and Mrs
                Courtney mentioned some of the deficiencies in the legislation
                and by-laws. I know from experience in North Belfast and as a
                city councillor that there are problems with enforcing the law.
                The issue comes up time and again for councils. People say that
                the by-laws are not effective, but the fact is that the
                legislation is inadequate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson mentioned a couple of areas of
                concern. For example, if the police find someone with an open
                container of alcohol and know that that person has been drinking
                outside a designated drinking area, there is nothing they can do
                unless they catch the person in the act or he or she is an
                under-age drinker. That brings the law into total disrepute.
                Much money is spent by local authorities on putting up signs
                that say &quot;No Drinking&quot;, and to a great extent that is
                a token effort at tackling the problem. I once asked my local
                authority in Belfast about the number of people who had been
                convicted of offences in relation to the by-laws, and the number
                was paltry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another area of concern is that although many
                streets and parks in any borough or council are designated as
                areas where people cannot drink, the by-laws cannot cover entire
                areas. That can lead to the problem simply being pushed from one
                area to another and people calling for their areas to be added
                to the list of designated areas. One school of thought says that
                a council should have the power to ensure that an entire area is
                covered by the by-laws.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem causes great concern, and it
                seems to be on the increase. People are entitled to consume
                alcohol if they wish, but we must draw the line at heavy
                drinking in public areas, because it can lead to antisocial
                behaviour and other problems. Current legislation is inadequate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support what the motion says about an
                education programme. Sometimes we talk about enforcement and
                neglect education — these two elements must go hand in hand.
                Neither enforcement nor education on its own will solve the
                problem. As with litter, there is no point in simply fining
                people for dropping it; people must be educated so that they do
                not drop it in the first place.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fully support the call for an education
                programme — or the enhancement of existing education
                programmes — and increased resources to deal with the problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have spoken about the need to have
                legislation amended. The problem is that the motion as currently
                worded does not call for legislation to be changed, although I
                think that that is the thrust behind it. The motion states that
                current levels of enforcement of the by-laws are inadequate,
                calls for increased resources and mentions a Province-wide
                education programme. However, I think that many Members — and
                the proposer of the motion, in her winding-up speech — will
                accept that the deficiency of legislation is a major issue.
                Perhaps some sort of amendment should be considered in relation
                to that. That may be what lies behind the thrust of the motion,
                although its wording is not explicit. I am happy to support the
                motion in so far as it goes, and I believe that the underlying
                message is that there is a need to examine the terms of the
                legislation itself.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. Members have mentioned
                the lack of resources available for education programmes. I
                agree. The issue is not just about people drinking in our
                streets; it is also about educating our young people — and
                those not so young — on the dangers of the misuse of alcohol.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alcohol misuse creates massive social and
                family problems. Joan Carson rightly said that the Minister of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety has relaunched a
                strategy which, as the Minister said in answer to a question in
                April, is aimed at reducing adult alcohol problems. The strategy
                commits the Department to three objectives: encouraging a
                sensible approach to drinking, promoting effective treatment
                services and protecting individuals and communities from the
                damage caused by alcohol misuse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The majority of on-street drinking is done by
                young people. They are likely to be under age and therefore
                cannot purchase alcohol legally. We need to ask where they get
                this drink. We are aware that some adults make money by
                purchasing alcohol from off-licences for these young people.
                That happens in towns and cities across the North. Some young
                people produce fake identification, and others get dolled up to
                the nines to appear older than they are.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not sure whether people are aware that
                in my own area, west Belfast, my party and several community
                groups and local drinking establishments were involved in
                setting up a community off-sales initiative. It was a pilot
                scheme to encourage the community and the off-licences to tackle
                the issue of under-age drinking and the associated problem of
                on-street drinking. We were encouraged by the response of the
                off-licences, the community groups involved and the wider
                community. The off-licences agreed to require identification and
                not to sell drink to people unless they were over 21 years of
                age. Those involved in off-sales say that they are losing some
                of their profit, but they do not mind because they are playing a
                part in helping the community to tackle the wider problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must develop an approach to tackle alcohol
                abuse through peer education and through educational programmes
                in our schools. The role of the education system has been
                mentioned. We need to target and attack the culture of drinking.
                Drink is promoted in big neon lights. Adults set the tone. The
                behaviour of adults can encourage or discourage our young
                people. Young people need to learn about the dangers of alcohol
                misuse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know it has been touched on earlier, but,
                as an overall co-ordinated approach, we need to deal with people
                who sell alcohol and adults who make money by encouraging young
                people to drink. We need a co-ordinated approach to the
                advertising of alcohol. Alcohol creates damage in the family,
                and in the social and community sector. We need to say that it
                is not a glamour issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the comments of Joan Carson. I was
                alarmed by the statistics she and Annie Courtney referred to
                with regard to the money spent on hospital-related incidents
                around alcohol misuse. We also need to look at fixed- penalty
                fines. Annie Courtney did mention that the winos seem to be more
                likely to end up in court. We need to take on board whether
                these fixed-penalty fines work. Usually these people have little
                or no money anyway, so where do they go? Are we creating a
                vicious circle? We need a long-term, strategic, co-ordinated
                approach to tackle the whole issue, not only of under-age
                drinking but also of alcohol misuse. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs E Bell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and the comments made by
                Mrs Carson in her comprehensive speech. It is an unfortunate
                fact of life that, unlike most other countries where pavement
                cafes are encouraged, the situation in Northern Ireland
                militates against this. It does not lend itself to the often
                delightful practice of open-air drinking, even in such organised
                legal establishments as cafe bars, and so on — certainly in my
                area. Our primary objective must be to strenuously oppose the
                many, often illegal, forms of largely under-age open-air
                drinking.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my constituency of North Down, outdoor
                drinking occurs on a regular basis throughout the area —
                unchecked on most occasions. The RUC maintains that its problem
                is undermanning, resulting in an inability to enforce the law.
                Therefore, the reputation of the RUC is the first to suffer, and
                the problem gets worse. The situation on the streets of central
                Bangor at the weekends is such that many of the youth of the
                town head into Belfast and other places for their entertainment.
                Very few residents of any age would dare to venture onto the
                seafront or High Street areas after dark. This cannot be allowed
                to continue. Also, when some of the drinkers are moved away from
                the seafront into the suburbs, the elderly there live in fear of
                their houses being wrecked, or worse. It makes life very
                difficult, both for residents and tourists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A more active enforcement role is required,
                and this may take many forms, including education, which has
                been mentioned by other Members. Also, much more concerted
                action by the RUC, with the support of other agencies and
                stronger legislation, is first and foremost on my and my
                constituents’ list. It is really a case of having a good
                working partnership between councils, the RUC and the Department
                of Health, Social Services and Public Safety with its different
                strategies, as Sue Ramsey mentioned. When this partnership
                works, it ensures that the dangers of drinking in public places,
                drink-driving, burglary, vandalism, and so on are recognised by
                all sections of the community as serious breaches of the law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The continuing sale of alcohol to people
                under the legal age limit is also something that needs to be
                more rigorously investigated — again, a measure requiring the
                attention of the RUC — although, as Sue Ramsey pointed out,
                there are more community initiatives. That is very welcome.
                Those found selling alcohol to under-age persons should be put
                out of business immediately, if possible. We must strengthen and
                implement the legislation effectively so that the RUC and other
                agencies have the appropriate support. We have to cut down the
                supply of alcohol as much as possible. We need to arrest those
                who still insist on flouting the law and prosecute them with the
                full might of the law. We must ensure that the courts not only
                are able to sentence them effectively and severely but also are
                charged to do so to a much greater degree than they tend to do
                at present with the few who are brought before them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Nigel Dodds. The position is
                comparable to that of people who fail to buy dog licences, or to
                prevent their dogs from soiling the streets. When they are
                brought to court, the magistrates consider the matter to be too
                small and simply fine them. We must get out of that mindset. We
                can make major headway towards greatly reducing the blight on
                our society if the motion is passed and the attention of the
                relevant authorities is drawn to it. I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and congratulate Mrs
                Carson on the excellent manner in which she proposed it. Not one
                constituency represented in the Assembly has been free from the
                blight brought about by the increasing problem of outdoor
                drinking. It is reaching epidemic proportions throughout
                Northern Ireland, and even in those areas where the local
                authorities have attempted to take some action, law enforcement
                is difficult. The problems are compounded by the fact that the
                already hard-pressed members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary do
                not have enough resources. They are struggling with major
                problems such as domestic crime and the increased terrorist
                threat, and unfortunately alcohol abuse is fairly low on their
                list of priorities. It is only when this kind of activity takes
                on the magnitude of some of the incidents that have occurred in
                the Queen’s University area, where many people drink
                excessively, continue to do so on the streets and then start to
                fight, that it becomes a major problem for the security forces
                and the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson’s motion proposes attempts to
                educate young people in order that we may in the future help to
                alleviate the problem or remove it from society. Probably most
                people, and particularly those with young families, are
                conscious of the fact that there is increased pressure on our
                young people through television, magazine and newspaper
                advertising. Alcohol has been glamorised and made fashionable,
                and it represents something desirable for young people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was good reason for the banning of
                tobacco advertising, and urgent attention and serious
                consideration should be given to the promotion of alcohol. As
                the father of a young girl, I am aware that children are taken
                up with advertising such as that for Budweiser and the vodka ads
                that are made to look glamorous or have catchphrases that even
                the youngest child starts to parrot and mimic. It shows the
                impact of unscrupulous people who have only financial gain in
                mind. These large companies that promote alcohol are not
                targeting older age groups, who have already determined the type
                or brand of alcohol they are going to use. They are carefully
                and clearly targeting the younger market that will be coming on
                stream in a few years’ time. I particularly welcome the
                opportunity that may be created when someone is appointed as an
                ombudsman for children’s affairs — a matter referred to in a
                previous debate. This matter should be given top priority in our
                attempts to prevent our children being subjected to this type of
                abuse — it can be described as nothing else.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In closing, I congratulate Mrs Carson on
                tabling the motion, and I am delighted that we have an
                opportunity to support it.</p>

                available for this important debate. I warmly commend and
                congratulate my Colleague Joan Carson on bringing the matter to
                the attention of the Assembly. It gives this issue necessary
                attention, which is very timely. As Members have already said,
                we have all been faced with problems in relation to illegal
                outdoor drinking in our districts. The problem of enforcement is
                a major task confronting everyone. Current legislation is
                clearly unsatisfactory. It necessitates someone being caught in
                the act of consuming alcohol. Apparently, it is not enough to
                catch someone with a glass or bottle in their hand; they must be
                partaking. That has been a major flaw in the current
                legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am interested to know — and Mrs Carson
                may be able to shed some light on this — who has overall
                responsibility for the matter. Is it the Minister of the
                Environment because of his responsibilities for local
                government, or is it the Minister of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety? In any education programme, it is important that
                there is joined-up government and that all bodies with input
                into helping resolve these matters give consideration to them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Enforcement is a serious problem. It has
                already been said that it is not possible or practicable to
                expect the RUC to be at every street corner or town centre.
                However, the problems created by illegal drinking in open places
                now dog many town centres, which are not now being inhabited by
                the &quot;right&quot; kind of people, so to speak. Largely
                speaking, many of our larger towns have become ghost towns,
                particularly at night. The only people found in them are winos
                and people with serious alcohol- and other substance- related
                problems. We should remember that we have a responsibility for
                those people too — to give them proper care and attention, and
                to try to ensure that we lead them away from those activities
                and give them better opportunities in life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my constituency of Newry and Armagh, and
                indeed in the district council area of Newry and Mourne, there
                are local initiatives such as pubs with no beer. That might
                sound unusual to some Members, but experiments are being tried
                to alert young people to the dangers of alcohol. It is one thing
                to be in a party mood or quite sociable, but it can lead to
                serious addiction and to the most serious social problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am bound to say that there is parental
                responsibility in this area. It is crucial that parents are
                aware of where their children are and who they are with, and
                that they put parental influence at a premium.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that the Government did
                not propose to introduce legislation in the Queen’s Speech to
                extend the opening hours of public houses and make drink more
                readily available, as was advocated by some very misinformed
                people, on a 24-hour basis. More than enough alcohol can already
                be bought and consumed. Extending the licensing hours would only
                exacerbate many of our social problems. We should consider
                restricting the opening hours of places where alcohol is sold,
                particularly if it is being sold to people who are under age.
                There should be severe sanctions against the owners and
                proprietors of such establishments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the motion. It is timely and should
                be brought to the attention of the relevant Ministers and their
                Committees, so that appropriate legislation can be framed and
                the Assembly can make a contribution to society. That will be a
                positive result that will help us to deal with this intractable
                problem.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank all those who remained for the debate
                after a hectic period earlier. It shows that they feel that the
                matter is important. If other Members take time to read Hansard,
                they will see that we have a big problem in all constituencies
                whose Members have spoken. We have a problem common to all: not
                a town, village, area or townland is free from under-age
                drinking and the accessibility of drink. Mrs Courtney said that
                the blanket ban was unenforceable, but it is something we must
                think about — either a ban or some other way of dealing with
                the problem throughout Northern Ireland. Mrs Courtney also
                brought up something that I had forgotten about — the pressure
                that is put on our hospital services at the weekend — and I
                welcome that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nigel Dodds said that the by-laws are not
                adequate, and I agree with him about signage. We have the
                country covered with no-drinking zones, yet nobody takes any
                heed. The legislation requires amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was interested in what Sue Ramsey said
                about her area of west Belfast and the pilot scheme. Some people
                are doing that in local areas, and it is very commendable. Danny
                Kennedy said much the same, and that is fine in particular
                areas, but we need an overall response on this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eileen Bell talked about the fear generated
                at weekends. In a local village in my country area there is an
                atmosphere of fear caused by drinking. Cedric Wilson talked
                about television advertisements and the pressures on young
                people. The banning of tobacco advertising was a good suggestion
                and something to be considered — perhaps not by the Assembly,
                but other places could ban television advertisements. Those
                advertisements target young people, and once they have them
                hooked on alcopops and such things, they have customers for the
                rest of their days.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To tackle the problem sensibly, the present
                by-laws need to be amended to include powers to confiscate
                alcohol being consumed in public. A clearer definition is needed
                of what is meant by the possession of, or consumption of,
                alcohol in public. The power to prosecute offenders should be
                withdrawn from councils, but there should be a liaison role for
                them with the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stricter control of the licensing of
                establishments that sell alcohol would be useful, as would an
                accredited Province-wide training scheme for staff of bars and
                off-licences. It might be considered mandatory for businesses to
                be included in this scheme as a condition to obtaining a licence
                or a licence renewal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Province-wide scheme to provide identity
                cards for those over 18 years of age might reduce the incidence
                of alcohol purchase by under-age customers. A valid identity
                card could be used as a proof of identity in situations other
                than the under-age purchase of alcohol. The co-ordinated
                approach suggested in the document on the strategy for reducing
                alcohol-related harm should include direct co-ordination and
                co-operation with the RUC. If the statistics on alcohol-related
                harm were combined, councils, the Assembly and the public could
                be made aware of the human and monetary costs involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank everyone who contributed to the
                debate. This is a complex subject, and the debate highlighted
                the problems we have to address. I ask that the points made
                today be noted and acted on by the Departments concerned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy has asked which Department has
                overall jurisdiction on this matter. I cannot answer that. The
                Department of Education, the Department of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety and the Department of the Environment
                could all work together to develop appropriate legislation to
                address effectively the problems of drinking in public,
                under-age drinking, the resultant disturbances and social
                problems. I ask that the motion be supported.</p>
