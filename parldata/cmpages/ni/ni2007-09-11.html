		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I want to say something about the statement that the Minister of Agriculture  and Rural Development made yesterday. Mr Ford raised a point of order, asking  why two members of the Executive were called to ask questions of an Executive  colleague. The Deputy Speaker Mr McClarty was in the Chair at the time, and he  undertook to raise the matter with me. I have given it some consideration.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that Standing Orders do not preclude  Ministers from asking questions of other Ministers. However, page 36 of the  &lsquo;Northern Ireland Assembly Companion&rsquo; &mdash; I am sure that everyone has <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">a copy with them &mdash; shows that such questions were  no</span>t the usual practice in the previous Assembly. However, I believe that  Ministerial statements offer Members an <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">important  opportunity to hold the Executive to ac</span>count. In future, therefore, I  intend to call members of the Executive to ask questions following a statement  from a ministerial colleague only in special circumstances. I may still call  them as private Members, referring to them by name rather than by their  ministerial office.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that that clears up that matter. It was a very good  point of order, and I must say that points of order of that nature are scarce  in the House.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Football Offences Act</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  this debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10  minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members will have five minutes  to speak. One amendment has been selected and published on the Marshalled List.  The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes to propose and five minutes  to make a winding-up speech.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly congratulates the Irish Football  Association on its campaign against sectarianism and, in order to strengthen  powers of sporting bodies to deal with sectarianism and violence in sports  grounds, calls on the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to commence  consultation, with a view to introducing to Northern Ireland an Act similar to  the Football (Offences) Act 1991.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to begin by stating clearly that the Alliance  Party&rsquo;s position is that any legislation designed to address the conduct of  spectators at sporting events should not simply consider association football  but must cover all sports that are played competitively in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland has a long and proud tradition of achievement in all sports. All sections of the  community can be justly proud of that legacy. Sport can be a unifying  and positive force for good in our society. Northern Irish football, for example,  is currently on the crest of a wave &mdash; if we ignore Saturday evening&rsquo;s  performance against Latvia  &mdash; and it brings <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">a tremendous sense of pride  and enthusiasm to everyone. </span>As with  all sporting success, the football team represents an opportunity for this  country to be seen in a positive light across the world, helping us to  demonstrate that we are emerging from a  troubled past, working towards <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">a  brighter future and welcoming people from all religious</span>, cultural and  ethnic backgrounds into our society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I stress my understanding that the vast majority of  spectators and supporters want nothing more than to enjoy the atmosphere of a  competitive event and to support their chosen team, or player, in a peaceful  manner. Indeed, I wish to recognise and commend the Amalgamation of Official  Northern Ireland Supporters Clubs on its outstanding work and, in particular,  its Football for All ethos, which is promoted by the Irish Football Association (IFA) and encourages  participation by everyone, regardless of political affiliation, cultural  identity, gender, religious background or disability. I congratulate the  amalgamation on being awarded the Brussels International Supporters Award 2006  for this vital work and also its efforts for charity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I note remarks made by Michael Boyd, the IFA&rsquo;s head of  community relations, that efforts to combat abuse have had a positive impact on  the number of spectators attending Northern Ireland football matches,  with regular sell-out games. The Northern Ireland shirt is now  flying off the shelves, which is good news; let us hope that the shirts are  manufactured locally.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Gaelic Football Association (GAA) and other sporting  bodies in Northern Ireland  have also made positive outreach efforts, which is a welcome step. We  congratulate all those organisations. However, we must sadly acknowledge that  all too often local sporting events have been hijacked by groups of individuals  and used as an outlet for disturbing expressions of bigotry, hatred and  intolerance. Those allegations have also been made against individual players.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Government have acknowledged the need for movement in  their action plan on a shared future; a specific action point in that plan is  that, after a consultation period, the provisions of the Football (Offences)  Act 1991 would be introduced to Northern    Ireland. Although any legislation should  cover all spectator sports and will require tweaking to address specific Northern Ireland  issues, the 1991 Act is the best place to start.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That tough legislation has helped to stamp out a culture of  hooliganism and hatred in English club football.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s recent past has witnessed a  catalogue of shameful incidents in which there have been actual and alleged  instances of sectarian threats and abuse. The result has been that talented  young sportspeople, such as Neil Lennon, who plays soccer, and Darren Graham,  who plays GAA sports, withdrew from sporting life in the Province, leaving it  the poorer for their absence. However, I am delighted to report that Darren  Graham has now returned to play the game that he loves.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Players who come from ethnic minorities have also been  subject to outrageous abuse. That should not &mdash; and cannot &mdash; be tolerated. The  excellent work of the IFA in tackling such issues has been encouraging,  particularly its campaign to kick sectarianism  out of football. I also welcome its Football Without Frontiers  initiative, which has been designed to combat racism and sectarianism and which  brings together experts from the UK  and Ireland  to work on those issues.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">International bodies such as the Union of European Football  Associations (UEFA) have disciplinary regulations on discrimination. Those  measures are welcome and should be introduced in Northern Ireland. The Assembly  should support those measures through its legislative process. The Football  (Offences) Act 1991 provides a useful template for any legislation, as its remit covers any act that occurs at a ground,  including events that take place in the two hours before the advertised  start of a match and up to one hour after it has ended. The 1991 Act also makes  offences of indecent racial chanting, throwing missiles and entering the  playing area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The football banning orders that have been imposed in England, Scotland  and Wales  can guide us when we come to devise penalties for offences. Such is the  seriousness of some offences that, in certain cases, a lifetime ban from  domestic and international events would not be inappropriate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Positive steps to eliminate discrimination in sport have been proven not only to have real societal  benefits but commercial benefits. I understand that society must also  address discrimination, but that is a longer-term objective. However, with the  prospect of a multi-sports stadium being built in Northern Ireland &mdash; I use the  word &ldquo;prospect&rdquo; deliberately &mdash; sport here is entering a new era. We should do  everything that we can to support it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that discrimination in sport is dealt with by  the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure  and the NIO, given that the latter&rsquo;s remit encompasses public order and  incitement to hatred. However, I encourage the Minister of Culture, Arts and  Leisure, who, I am glad to see, is with us today and is paying particular  attention to what I am saying, to take the lead on this important issue. As elected representatives, we must send the clear  message that there is no place for hatred in any part of society in  Northern Ireland and that competitors and true fans should be allowed to enjoy  and participate in sporting activities, free from persecution of any kind.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To date, legislation that our Executive have made has been  sparse, to say the least. Our new Assembly now has an opportunity to begin to  do what its representatives were elected to do, which is to legislate. I ask  for Members&rsquo; support for the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: Leave out all after the first  &ldquo;sectarianism&rdquo; and insert</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;, urges all sporting bodies in Northern Ireland to undertake  similar initiatives against sectarianism; and calls on the Northern Ireland  Office to commence consultation with a view to introducing legislation to  address sectarianism, racism and violence associated with all sporting events.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionists welcome the opportunity to debate  sectarianism, racism and violence in sport. I am sure that the House joins me  in thanking the three Members in whose names the motion stands.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Our amendment is intended to do nothing more than  strengthen the motion, and, in doing so, it will inject into the debate an  immediate sense of bounce and vitality by tackling the ability of legislation  to correct at source. We must, therefore, lay responsibility at the door of the  Northern Ireland Office and say to it that a serious problem exists, which it  must approach with a clear objective. That clear objective is to introduce  quickly the legislation that is necessary to support those who are working to  stamp out the evils of sectarianism, racism and violence. As ever, I am pleased  to see in the House the Minister who is responsible for sports. No doubt,  however, he will confirm that such legislation is a reserved matter.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, I hope that he will confirm his willingness to  encourage the NIO to act swiftly to introduce the legislation that the Assembly  requires.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That legislation, in the words of our amendment, would take  Northern Ireland  beyond a single sports Act to distilling an all-embracing law that caters for  multiple sports events. Regrettably, however, that legislation carries with it  evidence of our society&rsquo;s inability to overcome sectarianism and racism without  resorting to, and depending on, new laws &mdash; evidence that points equally to  failings in society itself.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot be proud to admit that laws are now required to  deal with the yobs and louts who give sport a bad name. It is a pity, too, that  bias, ignorance, intolerance and downright  bloody-minded unwillingness prevent some from appreciating the talent  and great skills of sportsmen and sportswomen, let alone serve to obstruct others from the pleasure and pride of  competing for the team because they love, and want to play in, a game of  sport.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist amendment was tabled to widen the scope  and impact of new laws, and to ensure that they will contain a decisive  mechanism to remove sectarianism, racism and violence from sport. The motion singles  out one sport through a call to introduce legislation similar to the Football  (Offences) Act 1991; our amendment, however, intends the same law for all  sports, because none should, or can, be excluded &mdash; not even tiddlywinks in the  leisure centre or croquet on the public lawn &mdash; as long as sectarian, racist  louts can, and do, stalk even that kind of sports event.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Our amendment asks the House to send a serious and  significant signal to all sports. That should first be done by highlighting and  complimenting the Irish Football Association&rsquo;s magnificent efforts. Secondly,  all should be alerted to the fact that no sport can be complacent, because none  is free from sectarianism and hatred. Sectarianism, racism and associated  violence are not confined to soccer, nor are those problems only for the IFA to  address.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To call for legislation is correct; however, let us do it  properly, by covering all sports, including Gaelic games, which are among the  highest spectator sports in Northern Ireland, and at which recent appalling incidents  of sectarianism made headline news. Those headlines shocked and rocked the  sport, and caught the attention of those with little interest in, and knowledge  of, Gaelic sports. They were a timely reminder of the brutality of sectarianism  &mdash; a wake-up call to knock us out of complacency, highlighting how a young  player can be harmed to the extent that he stated a desire to quit the hurling  game that he loved so much, because he could take no more sectarian abuse.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Such incidents have no place in sport or society, and must  be stopped. Although I support the introduction of legislation to stop the  ugliness of sectarianism and racist abuse, I suspect that enforcing such laws  will not be an easy task. That must be examined in the consultation that will  follow this debate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, I mentioned sending a signal to the NIO. I trust  that today the House will couple that with a strong message to the louts and  yobs that they are not wanted at sporting events. It would be better for both  sport and society if there were no need to bring in new laws to protect against  sectarianism, racism and violence in sport, both on and off the field.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the harsh facts of reality tell us otherwise:  there is a need. Today, that need has been strongly identified, just as the  demand for a sporting culture free from sectarianism and yobbish behaviour has  also been made, and, I sense, just as strongly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As with all matters where change can make a positive  difference, we may not see an immediate improvement, but we can content  ourselves in the knowledge that tomorrow&rsquo;s young players and tomorrow&rsquo;s  supporters will surely benefit from the decision that I trust Members will take  today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is not a great difference between the motion and the  amendment; however, the difference is sufficient. The motion does not refer the  issue of legislation to Northern    Ireland, where ultimately the responsibility  will rest for the foreseeable future. The amendment is, therefore, more  suitably prescriptive and more exacting in its representation of the Assembly&rsquo;s  views. I ask the sponsors of the motion to consider fully the merits of the  Ulster Unionist amendment and the House as a whole to support it.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Today&rsquo;s motion addresses sectarianism in sport, which is but one facet of a problem that surrounds us &mdash;  sectarianism in our society. I am happy to support the amendment,  because it broadens the debate from just sectarianism to include racism and the  violence associated with all sporting events. The IFA is to be commended for  the good work that it has done in tackling sectarianism. There is also a  recognition that the two other main sports &mdash; rugby football and Gaelic games &mdash; must be considered when dealing with sectarianism.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the introduction, through the Northern Ireland  Office and Westminster,  of a sports offences Act that would cover  all the principal games. It should cover not only violence, sectarianism  and antisocial behaviour in and around the grounds, but address the involvement  of alcohol in some of that antisocial behaviour.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, we have been able to commend the IFA. However, I  want to focus on something that Mr McNarry touched on &mdash; the situation regarding  Gaelic games. The case of Darren Graham highlighted a problem with Gaelic  sports. His presence shows that the GAA is not a totally Roman Catholic  organisation; clearly, there are people from the Protestant community who take  part in Gaelic games. However, although the organisation is perhaps 99% Roman  Catholic, it is 100% nationalist. That is the key issue. The GAA introduces  something to sport that should not be there.  It has, built into its constitution, a nationalist ethos, ambition and  aspiration. A careful reading of the GAA&rsquo;s constitution shows that very clearly  to be the case.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That nationalist, and, in some cases, republican,  aspiration is reflected in several ways. Many GAA grounds are named after republican heroes or, as people from my  community would certainly view them, terrorists. In addition, there are not  only grounds &mdash; I have a long list, but I would not be able to cover them all in five minutes &mdash;but clubs named after  republicans. There are also competitions named after republican  terrorists. Even the two premier trophies in the Gaelic world &mdash; for Gaelic  football and hurling &mdash; are named after men who were members of the Irish  Republican Brotherhood.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is often pointed out by propagandists for the GAA that  Sam Maguire came from a Church of Ireland background in County Cork.  In fact, Sam Maguire was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a  gunrunner, a terrorist &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>: I have one minute and 20 seconds remaining, so I do not have  time. I can discuss matters with the Member later. I have a long list with  which to deal.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we deal with this issue. The premier  GAA trophy is named after Sam Maguire, and it was taken around this Building by  one of the leading Sinn F&eacute;in Members. Indeed, the Deputy First Minister has had  that trophy in this Building in the past.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not surprising that one finds a difficulty with the  republican ethos in the GAA when the premier trophy is named after someone who  was implicated in the murders of members of  society in London  and elsewhere. Sam Maguire was an intelligence officer in the Irish  Republican Brotherhood who set up people to be murdered. He used his position  in the Post Office in London to bring guns into Ireland. All of  that tells me that there is a problem that is peculiar and unique to the GAA.  That is not an issue that arises in football, where clubs tend to be named after the local town or a particular  place. That is perfectly normal practice elsewhere in the world. In  rugby football, a similar situation prevails, but the GAA is an organisation  that is 100% nationalist, and I hope that when dealing with the wider issue,  that matter will be addressed.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; sa  d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo. I wish to commend and congratulate the Members who brought the motion before the House. However, I  am disappointed with the remarks of the previous contributor. We are supposed  to be discussing a motion that covers sports, but the Member went into history in great detail. Fair play to him for his  knowledge and his learning of history. However, it is a shame that his  speech addressed just one particular sport.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I take this opportunity to wish both the Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland  soccer teams well in their European  Championship qualifying endeavours. I hope that both teams qualify for the  championships.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that, one day,  we will see an all-Ireland football team. We should look at the example  of rugby, which has shown great leadership and courage in the past. An all-Ireland football team would show great  leadership and courage to all the fans on the island of Ireland,  would further reduce the level of sectarianism and would help the integration  of newcomers to our society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to commend the IFA on its campaign against sectarianism. I congratulate Michael Boyd  and the community relations department on its achievements. That department has  been proactively out in our communities, delivering programmes to reduce  sectarianism and to make football a more inclusive  sport. Unfortunately, there are still individuals who chant sectarian  songs and fly flags in the grounds. That deters some sections of the community  from attending games.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I visited the IFA&rsquo;s website at the weekend and read its  Football for All section. The IFA&rsquo;s community relations policy statement states:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The IFA respects and values diversity. We endeavour  to provide an environment which values and  enables the full involvement of all people, in all aspects and at every  level of Northern Ireland  football, regardless of perceived cultural identity, political affiliation or  religious beliefs. We believe in the philosophy of Football For All.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is an important  statement, which shows that the IFA is taking the matter seriously.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also wish to congratulate the GAA on its response to the incidents in Fermanagh, to which other  Members have referred. Both the IFA and the GAA deserve congratulations.  However, the fact that this motion is before the House is a clear message that  there remains sectarianism, racism and violence in sports grounds. We must stop  that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Football (Offences) Act 1991 makes it an offence for  fans to throw missiles or to chant indecent or racial slogans. That is good,  and we can support that. However, sporting bodies, associations and clubs have  a responsibility to stamp out such behaviour. Sectarianism  and racism come in many forms and must be stopped immediately. If it  comes to the attention of clubs or associations that someone &mdash; a fan, a player,  or a club official &mdash; is acting in a sectarian or racist manner, officials  should act immediately and bar that person from future games.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must ensure that sport is open to everyone and that  everyone is made welcome whether they are taking part or are just spectators.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In concluding, I support the motion and commend the Members  who tabled it. However, it must be recognised that reducing sectarianism will  not be achieved by just introducing legislation &mdash; indeed, if we had our own  justice powers, we could make such legislation ourselves and not have to invite  outside bodies to do so. A lot of hard work will be required by the sporting  bodies to introduce anti-racism and  anti-sectarianism programmes, education programmes and other initiatives  to their members, players, officials, fans and associations, and to show real  leadership in stamping out racism and sectarianism. Let us all give racism and  sectarianism the red card. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I commend Kieran McCarthy for tabling the motion. If it were not for him, we  would not have had the amendment that was moved by David McNarry. The SDLP will  be supporting the motion and the amendment because there are clear reasons for  doing so.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It was extremely disappointing that Nelson McCausland used  almost four and a half minutes of his speech  to have a go at the GAA. The GAA&rsquo;s presentation to the Committee for  Culture, Arts and Leisure was, without doubt, the most extensive with regard to  raising young people in a holistic way in areas such as discipline, health,  education and social engagement. That view was accepted by the Committee, and  that language was used by the DUP. I did not think that his speech was fair  given the approach that he took during the presentation to the Committee.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Football (Offences) Act 1991 deserves serious  consideration in Northern    Ireland. Despite the considerable efforts  being made at association level in soccer, rugby and Gaelic, sectarian, racist  and abusive chanting is the reality at  sports grounds across Northern<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> Ireland</span> week in and week out. The Act makes it an offence  to make indecent or racialist chants at a football ground. The Act also  defines indecent or racialist chanting as being such that is abusive or  insulting to a person by reason of his  colour, race, nationality or creed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Central records of prosecutions under the Act in Britain have  only been kept since 2001. According to the Department of Culture, Media and  Sport, 93 people were convicted for racist or indecent chanting between the  beginning of the 2001-02 season and 2005. Unfortunately,  that figure would have been considerably higher had the legislation been introduced into Northern    Ireland during that period. However, simply extending the Act to Northern Ireland  may not be adequate for two reasons: first, it does not specify sectarian  chanting; secondly, it only applies to soccer.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister  of Culture, Arts and Leisure&rsquo;s announcement yesterday to market Northern Ireland  as a region in which athletes can prepare for the 2012 Olympics. That will be  hugely important for the quality of life here. However, the negative impacts of  sectarianism, as reported in the press, do not go down well, particularly at  international level.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The IFA, the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) and the GAA  deserve to be supported in their ongoing efforts to stamp out unacceptable behaviour. Over the past decade,  significant steps have been taken to address sectarian perceptions. The  GAA has abolished rule 21, and the IFA&rsquo;s Football for All campaign has been  rightly praised by Members and has gone a long way towards putting an end to  sectarianism. The IRFU introduced &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Call&rsquo; as a unifying  common anthem for Irish rugby.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no acceptable level of abuse in society, and there can be no place for it in sport. It is the  Assembly&rsquo;s job to provide legal protection to those who are tasked with  enforcing the standards that we set for ourselves. Had appropriate legislation  been in place during the summer, those who taunted Darren Graham, a young  Protestant who had played football and hurling for Fermanagh at under-21 level,  could have expected to face prosecution, and the Ballymena supporters, who, in  the words of Linfield manager David Jeffrey, hurled abuse at his Catholic  players, would be facing the prospect of not seeing an Irish league match for  quite some time.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Young people are not  born bad, and they are certainly not  born with sectarianism in their blood. As politicians, it is our job to  set an example. However, unfortunately, at times, we have heard sectarian  comments and chants in this Chamber, which is not a good example for the  leaders of the community to be setting.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister should issue a consultation document at  post-primary level and at all-spectator level for discussion in the community.  The community wants the leadership that such consultation would provide. Young  people, irrespective of background, should feel free, content and comfortable  when playing whatever sport they want in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  I support the amendment. The majority of sporting events in Northern Ireland  pass off without any trouble, and only a minority of fans, on a few occasions,  are involved in sectarian abuse or violence. Unfortunately, there have been  occasions when religious sectarianism has come to the fore in every sport,  along with sporadic outbreaks of hooliganism &mdash; no sport has been immune from  antisocial behaviour. Recently, in rugby, Welsh players allegedly suffered  racial abuse from spectators and players, and in GAA, a Down player was abused  at Casement Park. Tackling this deep-seated problem  is not easy, and legislation will not provide the whole answer. We must all take action and work in partnership, using  educational and promotional methods, with sports governing bodies, local clubs,  the police and the community itself.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Major steps have been taken in Great Britain as regards  legislative controls, investments, and improvements in infrastructure.  Unfortunately, those steps have not been taken in Northern   Ireland, and a principal difficulty for clubs here is  that legislation making it an offence to carry drink on supporters&rsquo; buses or  bring alcohol onto the terraces applies in other areas of the United Kingdom, such as Scotland, but  does not apply here. The police here are powerless to act in such  circumstances.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the safety legislation introduced in  2006 is fully enacted, as well as ancillary public order legislation, which  regulates spectators&rsquo; behaviour in relation to hooliganism and excessive  drinking. That legislation should apply to all major stadiums: rugby, GAA,  football and so on.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Glentoran Community Trust is an organisation in my  constituency that may provide an example of how the problem can be tackled. It  is the first trust of its kind to be set up in Northern Ireland, and during the  short time that it has been established, it has enrolled 400 members and  launched an initiative to encourage cross-community interest. The trust has  involved Glentoran Football Club, which has established good relations with the  principal of St Joseph&rsquo;s Primary School in St Comgall&rsquo;s  parish, Ballyhackamore, with a view to encouraging pupils to visit the local  football club. The school has an enrolment of 160 pupils, of which 40% are from  the Philippino and Polish ethnic minorities. Glentoran Community Trust and  Glentoran Football Club have brought pupils to the club and published  information in both languages. Such educational initiatives encourage people to  take an active part in tackling sectarianism. The trust has also obtained  grants and replaced paramilitary murals in east Belfast with portraits of the Glentoran  greats.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I must declare that I am a member of Linfield  Football Club. That club is to be congratulated on its scheme, Support for  Sport, through which it has attempted to address the issues also.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Linfield Football Club has allowed the local ladies&rsquo; camogie team to practise on its ground under  floodlights. Belfast Harlequins Rugby Football Club has also been  encouraging in that area, and all those actions help to promote a love of  sport.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Linfield &mdash; the current Irish League champions &mdash; have  undertaken a great deal of hard work. Some Members already have congratulated  the IFA on its Football for All programme, which has been very successful  because of its community relations officer. I am happy to support the amended  motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I will be brief as I  do not want to repeat anything that has already been said. An important point  that Wallace made is that action on the issue should start at club level.  Legislation is not the answer to any of the problems. We must get to a point at  which nothing happens that makes us think that legislation may be necessary.  Linfield Football Club has done great work, as has the IFA, and I appreciate  that great work.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, of all the sports played in Ireland, soccer  is the only one that is not played to any extent on an all-Ireland basis.  Although not a panacea, it might remedy the problem of sectarianism to some  extent if soccer followers were exposed to more all-Ireland competition.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Setanta Sports Cup is an important competition that has  had a big influence on the more successful teams in the North, particularly Linfield.  To leave the cocoon of the Six Counties may help supporters to broaden their  minds and see sport as sport, rather than as a means of exhibiting  narrow-mindedness and sectarianism.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I am in favour of the amendment. Some Members who spoke mentioned the  possibility of one team for the island. Were they to attend, or even watch, a Northern Ireland match, they would realise that  there already is only one team in Ireland  &mdash; that being Northern    Ireland, of course.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Since 1998, the IFA, in partnership with the Northern  Ireland Community Relations Council, the Sports Council for Northern Ireland &mdash;  now Sport Northern Ireland &mdash; and the Amalgamation of Official Northern Ireland  Supporters Clubs, has worked to remove sectarianism from football through the  Football for All community relations programme.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As a Northern Ireland  supporter who has attended home  internationals in Windsor   Park since the late 1980s,  I have witnessed first-hand the change in atmosphere at the stadium, where  there is now an inclusive, family-orientated, football-focused environment.  That is due in no small part to self-policing by the Northern Ireland supporters clubs.  I congratulate them on the work that they do in that regard.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Anyone attending Windsor  Park will be serenaded throughout the  90 minutes with such modern classics as &lsquo;Away in a Manger&rsquo;, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re not Brazil, We&rsquo;re Northern Ireland&rsquo; and &lsquo;Stand up for  the Ulstermen&rsquo;. Fans now recognise that we are the twelfth man, and the  positive atmosphere and support that we generate has helped our national team  to famous victories against England,  Spain and Sweden.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, as supporting the team becomes more fashionable, a  danger exists of attracting a thuggish element. I had the great pleasure of  accompanying the green and white army on its excursion to Latvia at the  weekend. Although the result did not go our way, the noise and carnival  atmosphere generated by Northern Ireland  fans in Skonto Stadium was reminiscent of the wonderful nights that I have  experienced at Windsor   Park.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Speaking to fans before and after the game, I was made  aware of scattered incidents of clashes with local police. That was a result of  a combination of heavy-handedness by the Latvian authorities and of drinking  and stupid behaviour by a small proportion of Northern Ireland fans. That is a  worrying development. Northern Ireland  fans are proud of their title of best fans in Europe,  and they do not want that kind of behaviour to tarnish their good name.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Football (Offences)  Act 1991 introduced several offences aimed at removing missile throwing,  indecent and racialist chanting, and pitch invasions.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Other legislation has been promulgated since then to  strengthen the football authorities&rsquo; grip on the hooligan element. The Football  (Offences and Disorder) Act 1999, which amended the Football (Spectators) Act  1989, not only concerns itself with domestic football, but gives the courts the  power to impose banning orders at domestic and international games. Coupled  with that are tighter controls on ticket touting, which are contained in the  Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. The Sporting Events (Control of  Alcohol etc.) Act 1985, now amended by the Licensing Act 2003, prevents drunk  people from entering a football ground when a designated football match is  taking place; the consumption of alcohol on certain coaches, trains and motor  vehicles travelling to a designated football match; and the possession of  fireworks, flares and similar items at designated matches.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sadly, although the IFA has sought to deal with the  problems that were evident in domestic football and at international matches,  the GAA is perceived as an inherently sectarian organisation. Several Members  have mentioned the recent example of Darren Graham, a young Protestant who  simply wants to play the sport that he loves. Had he not highlighted the  bigotry that he faced, does anyone believe that he would have been given the  apologies and assurances that it would not happen again? I do not.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Rule 7(b) of the GAA&rsquo;s constitution states that the association should be non-sectarian. However,  supporters are led by example. What chance do they have when GAA grounds  and competitions are named after IRA volunteers who murdered their way through  decades of sectarian violence? Sectarianism must be stamped out of all sports.  Perhaps the GAA will follow the IFA&rsquo;s lead. I look forward to a &ldquo;GAA for all&rdquo;  initiative and a &ldquo;kick sectarianism out of the GAA&rdquo; campaign.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Will the Member agree that it is not simply a matter of tackling sectarianism  on the terraces, but of tackling the institutionalised political sectarianism  that is embedded in the constitution of the organisation to which she has just  referred?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I absolutely agree with the Member and I thank him for his intervention. A wide  range of legislation must be introduced in order to be effective. I, therefore,  support the amendment, which calls for a package of legislative measures.  Furthermore, I agree that such legislation should encompass all sports so that  all sporting bodies are given the tools to deal with sectarianism, violence and  all forms of antisocial behaviour.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sporting events should be about what is happening on the  pitch or field and about the pleasure and anguish of competition, not abuse and  intimidation.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. T&aacute; s&eacute; in am d&uacute;inn uilig an c&aacute;rta dearg  a thaispe&aacute;int do sheicteachas sa sp&oacute;rt. T&aacute; m&eacute; ar aon intinn le Paul Maskey ar  an &aacute;bhar sin. I agree with Paul Maskey, who said that it is high time to give  sectarianism and racism the red card in sport. At the outset, I wish to say  that Armagh supporters are not in any way  biased: they do not care who beats Tyrone.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are great rivalries and battles in sport. I commend  Wallace Browne for being able to transcend that great divide between Linfield  and Glentoran football clubs, which must have taken huge effort. I also commend  Kieran McCarthy for proposing the motion and David McNarry, who said that there  is no room for complacency on this matter. The motion specifically refers to  the IFA. I acknowledge the good work that  has been done by its Football for All campaign.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During the summer, I  visited Whiterock leisure centre in west Belfast for an imaginative and well organised  fun day. I went there in the company of Professor Eric Saunders, who is the  Cathaoirleach of Sport NI. We witnessed a great occasion during which young  sport stars were introduced to their own community; people such as Jane Adams,  who is a camogie all-star several times over. I was pleasantly surprised to  find that there are young people from that community who are on the books of,  for example, St Paul&rsquo;s  Gaelic Athletic Club and Linfield Football Club at the same time. Apart from  anything else, those young people are extremely busy making a positive  contribution to sport. I found it significant to learn that young people are on  the books of both a Gaelic football club  and Linfield Football Club. Good work must be acknowledged and  commended.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sport can be a tremendous unifier. It is no excuse for  abusive behaviour of any kind. Like Francie Brolly, I pay tribute to those  clubs that, at local level, exert hugely positive influences on young people &mdash;  which are clearly seen &mdash; in the areas of health and responsibility. I witnessed  those influences when I met the GAA&rsquo;s Ulster council and learned about  all the work that is carried out at a local  level. The introduction of  defibrillators in clubs throughout Tyrone and Armagh  is a good example of those clubs&rsquo; influence on health matters. The extent of  that scheme is being widened.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The GAA, the IFA, and all the responsible bodies, have a  lot of work to do. They do good work. Members know that Gaelic games are my  code. One issue that has not been raised in the Assembly, and which I feel  strongly about, concerns international soccer. Darron Gibson has recently come  under a lot of pressure because he opted to play for the Twenty-six Counties  team. Darron comes from Derry. He made the  choice to play for that team. I hope that FIFA will catch up with the Good  Friday Agreement in respecting the right of any individual to determine his or  her own national identity, and not to penalise anyone involved in those  matters.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Basically, action must be taken to ensure that sectarianism  is given the red card, as Paul Maskey has said. There should be no equivocation  in the matter a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  The issue of sectarianism in sport is one that I feel strongly about. I support  the amendment put forward by the Ulster Unionist Party. I have been an avid fan  of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  football team since my youth, which was not yesterday: I go back a few years. I  have travelled to foreign lands to watch the Northern Ireland team play. I did  not go to Latvia,  which was just as well. I have stood in rain and shine to cheer on my team. I  have remained proud of my home team throughout all their efforts.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members may know  that I watched the Northern Ireland team play in Spain in the 1982 World Cup. That was  one of the best teams that Northern    Ireland has ever had. I also supported my  home team in Mexico  in 1986. Therefore, I have been around when it comes to supporting Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  teams. I have watched many players come and go. I have seen some of the greats  wear green and white &mdash; and manage the team.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In recent years, I have seen a change in the way that  things are handled. It has been a good change. Since 2001, there has been a concerted effort by team members and fans  alike, facilitated by the IFA, to stamp out sectarianism and to go back to the  roots of team support &mdash; a love for the team and the beautiful game. No longer  are songs like &lsquo;The Billy Boys&rsquo; resounding throughout Windsor Park.  We cheer songs such as &lsquo;We&rsquo;re not Brazil,  We&rsquo;re Northern Ireland&rsquo;,  which I do not intend to sing. I suspect that, like my colleague, Michelle  McIlveen, I would not sound very melodious. I would probably bring the rain on.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  The slogan &lsquo;We&rsquo;re not Brazil,  We&rsquo;re Northern Ireland&rsquo;  could have been applied to the foot-and-mouth crisis as well.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I do not think so. Obviously, Barry has a different sense of humour from me.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We no longer leave our children at home, but bring them  with us to support the country. My sons, who are now young men, no longer have to leave the game early in case of  violence, as they did when they were wee boys. We can now watch to the glorious  or the bitter end, depending on the score. That change has also been remarked  upon by others. That is why Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  fans are the best fans in Europe. That is not  me saying that &mdash; it was attested by the award of the Brussels International  Supporters Award of 2006. The Football for All initiative has reaped its  reward.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, only so much can be achieved by the IFA. The  motion has been proposed to put powers into place that will back up the Football for All initiative. However, I do  not believe that the motion goes far enough, in two respects. The first is that  the three main offences under the Football  (Offences) Act 1991 &mdash; pitch invasion; indecent or racialist chanting;  and the throwing of missiles &mdash; do not fully address all the issues. The obvious  omissions begin with sectarian chanting, alcohol control, ticket touting at  matches, and the important football banning order, which would ensure that our  team falls into line with legislation that governs other European football  teams.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Our Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure Mr Poots is  making an effort to address that issue. He is working with the NIO to introduce those measures so that sporting bodies,  in their efforts to stamp out the nonsense in the matches, can have the backup  of the PSNI and the Home Office. Thus the game can once again become one that  father and son, mother and daughter, and so on, can enjoy the victory and  spoils of the event.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The IFA has achieved a fan base that realises that to  support a team means to do exactly that &mdash; support it, not drag others down.  Those fans want the prerequisites for attending matches to be a simple love of  the game and a desire to create a family atmosphere &mdash; and not the fact that a  fan comes from a particular background. Those efforts need to be backed by  further legislation &mdash; and more than simply the Football (Offences) Act 1991.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that sectarianism in GAA sports is very  much in the spotlight following the recent revelations  about the young Protestant, Darren Graham. My colleagues and other  Members have already mentioned the matter, and the young man&rsquo;s experience has  been well documented, so I do not intend to dwell on it. However, it is  unacceptable that he should feel that he has to leave the sport, and the GAA&rsquo;s  attempts to ensure that such an incident does not happen again must be given  power by backing up the PSNI and legislation to ensure that the sport is  player-friendly and supporter-friendly and can be enjoyed by those from all  backgrounds.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many young men of my age &mdash; I say young men, but perhaps the  word &ldquo;young&rdquo;is not entirely accurate &mdash; would have enjoyed watching a Gaelic  match in years gone by, but yet would feel uncomfortable doing so now. Most  Protestant young people do not know how the game is played or what the scoring  rules are. Those issues must be addressed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The IFA has brought Northern Ireland fans from a dark  place into a brighter place. The GAA should take note and apply the same  principles so that it can achieve the same result. Our children need to support  all sports in which we as a nation participate. They should enjoy the victories  of Northern Ireland and view them as a way of letting others see that we are  more than a small country &mdash; we are a small country with a big heart and soul.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr Poots)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I thank you for giving the Assembly  the opportunity to have this debate. I welcome the opportunity and appreciate  the fact that the motion and amendment have been brought forward today, while  recognising that there is a need to address issues of sectarianism, violence,  racism and antisocial behaviour at sporting venues across Northern Ireland.  However, sectarianism and hooliganism are not simply a problem for the world of  sport and football; they are societal problems that sometimes find their voices  at sporting venues. It is, therefore, a complex matter that requires the  introduction of a wide range of measures if it is to be successfully combated.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Against that background, I wish to pay tribute to the IFA&rsquo;s  excellent work to tackle sectarianism and hooliganism in soccer as part of its  Football for All campaign. Since 1998, the IFA has had a full-time community  relations officer who works in partnership with  the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council, Sport Northern Ireland  and the Amalgamation of Official Northern Ireland Supporters&rsquo; Clubs. Tribute should also be paid to the amalgamation for the  support that it has given to the IFA in dealing with those issues.  Members should be aware that, last year, delegates from UEFA and the European  Union awarded the amalgamation the Brussels International Supporters&rsquo; Award  2006 for its efforts to stamp out sectarianism.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is widely accepted that the work of the IFA, supported  by the amalgamation, has gone a long way towards reducing the incidence of  sectarianism and hooliganism in soccer.  That work strongly complements what the Government are trying to achieve  through their &lsquo;A Shared Future&rsquo; initiative, particularly with regard to  promoting equality and good relations across all communities. The IFA&rsquo;s  Football for All initiative continues to reaffirm my belief in the contribution  that sport can make to the promotion of the objectives in &lsquo;A Shared Future&rsquo;. I  have sought to reflect that belief in the new draft strategy for sport and  physical recreation, which should be published in the near future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, if we want to maximise the contribution that sport  can make to those objectives, we must also examine  closely the problems that it faces. All our major sporting venues are  dated and fall short of modern standards for safety and comfort. That situation  is not conducive to encouraging either good attendance or acceptable standards  of behaviour among spectators. That is one of several issues that must be  addressed if we are to tackle successfully problems of violent and disorderly  conduct among spectators.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In response to those issues, my Department has already  introduced an initiative on safety at sports grounds, including new legislation  in the form of The Safety of Sports Grounds  (Northern Ireland)  Order 2006, which is designed to promote safety at major sporting  venues. Over the past three years, my Department has also provided &pound;9 million  to Sport Northern Ireland to assist with the introduction of its stadia safety  prog&shy;ramme, the aims of which are to help clubs improve the standard of  facilities at their venues and to promote responsible management of major  sports events.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The improvement of the physical infrastructure of sports  grounds is, of course, only one dimension. The human dimension is equally  important. Since my appointment as Minister for sport, I have received  representations on the need for legislation to deal with hooliganism and  sectarianism at sports grounds. Having given those matters careful  consideration, I am now satisfied that offences must be created around  unauthorised pitch incursion; offensive chanting and missile throwing; bringing  bottles, flares and fireworks into grounds; the carrying and drinking of  alcohol on special public transport on the way to and from designated matches,  and during such matches; and ticket touting. The introduction of a football  banning order regime for Northern    Ireland will be critical when we qualify for  next year&rsquo;s European Championship finals tournament.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Members will, however, appreciate that those measures, although related to  sport, are in fact public order measures. The power to introduce them into Northern Ireland,  therefore, does not lie with this Assembly. Those are reserved matters, and  remain the responsibility of the Northern  Ireland Office. In light of that, I wrote recently to the Minister with  responsibility for criminal justice at the Northern Ireland Office, Paul  Goggins, informing him of my keenness to make early progress in this area, in  the interests of both sport and public safety. I have also asked Mr Goggins for  his co-operation in taking these matters forward as expeditiously as possible.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to report that I have received a letter from Mr Goggins in which he says that he will be  happy to work with me to agree an appropriate package of measures. I  intend to meet Mr Goggins later this month with  a view to taking the issue forward with the Northern Ireland Office.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  The Minister has mentioned some of the responsibilities of the Northern Ireland  Office and said that he wants to make pitch incursion an offence in the  proposed legislation. Is it not the case that many people in Northern Ireland  believe that a similar Order could and should have been introduced by a  previous incumbent in the Northern Ireland Office &mdash; Mr Peter Hain, the Secretary  of State? Had he introduced such legislation, however, a great deal of  attention would have been paid to his past activities, including pitch  incursions at sporting events many years ago, and embarrassing questions might  have been asked.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: The  Member knows that Ministers are not privy to the papers of their predecessors,  but I understand his point.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I welcome the Assembly&rsquo;s interest in this  matter. I assure the House that I am doing all in my power to ensure that early  progress is made in the introduction of new public order offences relating to  sports grounds. I firmly believe that they have a key part to play in improving  safety at sports grounds and in combating sectarianism, racism and violence in  sport and in society at large.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Progress in this direction will also go a long way towards  making our major sports venues more attractive to a larger and wider audience,  which is critically important for the development of sport in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  It will be difficult to amend the motion in the light of the Minister&rsquo;s  statement, which was very welcome, and which described the work that his  Department and the Northern Ireland Office are doing to grasp the nettle of  sectarianism and racism in sport.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will summarise Members&rsquo; contributions. Members across the  Chamber have co-operated on the issue, and I welcome the fact that all parties  appear to support the UUP amendment, which was designed to add breadth to the  original motion. Everyone has recognised that sectarianism  and racism are problems in our community but that those issues do not  reside only around sports grounds, of whatever code. Unfortunately,  sectarianism and racism are endemic, and they must be treated in various ways  by all sections of society. Legislation may play a role in defining some of the  necessary moves, but, for progress to be made, the clubs must make the real  moves with individuals and associations across the cultural divide.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Most Members have taken a modern approach, but Jim Shannon  almost stole my thunder. I think that I am one of the oldest Members present  today &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  You are.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I admit to that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As a schoolboy, I went to the infamous Northern Ireland versus Italy match,  when the referee and linesmen failed to turn up. Sixty thousand people in Windsor Park were waiting for the match, so a  local referee and linesmen were thrown into the den. The match took place and  finished up in a riot because of some  Continental tactics that had never been experienced in Northern Irish  soccer. The match was eventually replayed, and Northern   Ireland won, going on to play in international  competition in Europe. In those days, the  facilities were non-existent, and the toilets were medieval. As a young fellow,  my feet were lifted off the ground, and I was carried out through the gates on  the backs of thousands of people who were squeezing their way out of the  grounds. Fortunately, grounds and safety levels have improved over the  generations. The Minister&rsquo;s comments this morning indicate that his Department  will prioritise the future safety of grounds.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past 16 years, the Northern Ireland Office failed  to grasp the opportunity to address the problem of sectarianism and racism. The  initiative shown by the IFA and its supporters is to be welcomed. The GAA&rsquo;s  moves to address sectarianism in County   Fermanagh are also to be welcomed. The behaviour that is  reported in the media seems to focus on soccer and, sometimes, on Gaelic sports. However, there are also problems  with other sports, either before or after the match, which are referred to as a &ldquo;bit of laddism&rdquo;. I wonder  whether hotel proprietors, who have  to put their premises back together after certain festivities, see that  sort of behaviour as laddism or as  vandalism. Are the working-class followers of soccer, in particular,  being singled out for attention? Sometimes the offences are blown out of  proportion by the media. I am not saying  that such incidents do not, or should not, happen, but a knee-jerk  reaction sometimes follows those incidents.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">An in-depth consultation is needed. The University of Leicester has produced a good paper, which attempts  to identify the social problems of young males and problems in sports grounds  in England.  There is much useful information in that report.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister  for his statement, which is helpful and encouraging. There should now be  a widespread and meaningful consultation, with no point scoring. If the problems can be solved, everyone can enjoy  attending sporting events with their families &mdash; in my case, with my  grandchildren. Sport provides a good public image, and I wish the Northern Ireland team success in tomorrow&rsquo;s  match in Iceland; I was most  disappointed that the team lost its match against Latvia on Saturday. I want a  continuation of a positive approach to sport.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>: As a long-standing and long-suffering supporter of Bangor  Football Club and of Northern Ireland,  I also wanted to mention the riots after the 1957 Northern   Ireland versus Italy match, but Mr Robinson beat  me to it. Riots are not particularly new.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Was the Member at the match?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  Yes, I was.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Was the Member at both matches?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  Yes, I was. I have been to thousands of matches over the past 50 years.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I can speak  with some authority on football. I do not have the same level of  experience of GAA and rugby, because I have attended only a few matches.  However, the legislation that the motion proposes the introduction of should  not be restricted to football. Although Members have referred to the Football  (Offences) Act 1991, any new legislation should not be restricted to that one  sport. The 1991 Act is a template on which that legislation should be based,  but it should apply to other sports.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The situation faced by Darren Graham has already been  mentioned. However, there is also, as far as the news is concerned &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  Yes.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. I am pleased that those who delivered the  winding-up speeches on the motion and the amendment have acknowledged that we  all have a responsibility to tackle  sectarianism in sport. I am sure that the proposers of the amendment and substantive motion did not  intend to allow the DUP to engage in its favourite pastime of GAA  bashing. It is a pity that Mr McCausland failed to reflect on the timing of the  formation of the GAA. It was formed after centuries of ethnic cleansing of all  things Irish, including our language and our culture.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I thank the Member for her inter&shy;vention. I agree that there was a tendency to  GAA-bash during the debate. There has been quite a number of attacks on  referees at GAA matches, and so forth. However, the legislation could be useful  to all sports. Therefore, the motion is not trying to tie any new legislation  to football, other than its stating that the Football (Offences) Act 1991 could  form the template for that legislation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I first became aware of football in 1948, when Jimmy  Jones&rsquo;s leg was broken during rioting at Windsor Park.  My father was at that match, and he was in quite a state when he got home.  Belfast Celtic withdrew from the league as a result of that incident.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been sectarianism and violence at Irish League  matches for the past 50 years. As a Bangor  supporter, I remember once being surrounded by a group of fans. They were not  Linfield supporters, but they started singing &lsquo;The Sash&rsquo;, and so forth, to try  to provoke us good Protestants into attacking them, or something along those  lines &mdash; I am not sure what their exact intention was. However, there was  certainly a need for change then.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry&rsquo;s amendment is fine, and we can go along with  it. Several points that he made may delay legislation, however. Mr McNarry said  that our motion was specific to football &mdash; its intention was to include all  sports in any legislation. The tendency for other Members to attack the GAA  during today&rsquo;s debate is counterproductive.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Pat Ramsey said that there was sectarian chanting at sports  grounds across Northern    Ireland &ldquo;week in and week out.&rdquo; I have attended quite a few matches recently, and I  think that Mr Ramsey was exaggerating. There is some sectarian chanting, but  the situation has changed dramatically in recent years.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Michelle McIlveen talked about the change in atmosphere at  the IFA. That change has actually been happening since the 1980s. During the  early 1980s, I used to take my two sons to Windsor Park  to see all the international matches, and I was pretty disgusted with some of  the fans&rsquo; behaviour. When the Irish Republic beat Northern Ireland  4&ndash;0, I had never felt so intimidated at a football match in my life,  even though the fans causing the trouble were supporting the same team as me. I  had to take the children home halfway through the match.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Since then, the IFA has done wonderful work and brought  about dramatic changes, for which it has not been give full credit.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McElduff and Mr Brolly said that local clubs should become involved in promoting anti-sectarianism.  Ten years ago, I did not think that I would ever give credit to Linfield  Football Club, but it has done a good job in trying to promote  anti-sectarianism. In fact, the team now probably has more Catholic players  than Protestant, which it would not have done 20 years ago. The club has links with the GAA, it has hosted  camogie training sessions and it is also involved in the Dunfield initiative, which is a cross-border youth league  bringing together football teams from Northern Ireland and the Republic. That initiative has been successful in  changing the fans&rsquo; attitudes. Fans who attend internationals at Windsor Park now do not recognise it from 20  years ago, or even 10 years ago.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  wish to add my congratulations to a local club. I do not go to football matches  very often but, last week, I went to Donegal Celtic Football Club in west Belfast. The club opened  its grounds and turned them into a mini Chinatown  to welcome the Chinese community. The team played a friendly game with a  Chinese football team. I do not want to tell Members the score, but it was a huge humiliation: 5-0 to Donegal Celtic.  Everyone enjoyed the game, and it was a wonderful night. I also pay tribute to  Linfield Football Club, because it has also worked with the Chinese community.  Donegal Celtic said that it hopes to play a Polish football team next. I hope  that they also have a good night.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  That illustrates the progress that those clubs are making in tackling  sectarianism and racism. I also recall a Northern Ireland match against the  Republic where black players from the Republic team received horrible racial  abuse.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The violence must also be tackled. FIFA is now getting much  stronger on violence. In the past couple of years, two international teams have  had matches cancelled because of violence in their stadiums. A football offences Act would benefit the IFA, and  Howard Wells of the IFA has said that he would support it. We must get  rid of sectarianism, racism and violence.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to the amendment, it is true that criminal  penalties for football offences would have to be introduced in Westminster  legislation. This is a cross-cutting issue, and the Department of  Culture, Arts and Leisure has the lead on  anti-racism and anti-sectarianism in football. In England, while  the Home Office leads on the criminal side of football offences legislation,  the Department for Culture, Media and Sport leads on anti-racism and on  building a culture of tolerance and inclusion in sport.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the Minister intends to meet his NIO counterpart  later this month to discuss the possibility of introducing legislation. I find  it hard to imagine that the NIO will rebuff a unanimous view from the Assembly  and the Executive that action is required on such an important issue. There is  no reason why the Minister and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure  cannot drive this issue forward and get the NIO moving. The general public are  always asking what politicians do to earn their money. This is an issue where  recent events have shown that action is necessary now, and passing the buck to  the NIO will not endear us to them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, <span style="font-style:normal; ">That the  amendment be made</span>, put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly  congratulates the Irish Football Association on its campaign against  sectarianism, urges all sporting bodies in Northern Ireland to undertake similar initiatives against sectarianism;  and calls on the Northern Ireland Office to commence consultation with a view  to introducing legislation to address sectarianism, racism and violence  associated with all sporting events.</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="3"></a>Attacks on Orange Halls</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10  minutes for the winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to speak will  have five minutes. One amendment has been selected and published on the  Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes to propose  and five minutes for the winding-up speech.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly condemns  all attacks on Orange Halls and calls on all political parties to use their  influence to stop such sectarian attacks.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In proposing the motion, I wish to make it clear that I am  a proud member of the Orange Order in north Down. The Orange Order is a  religious organisation that is dedicated to the promotion of civil and  religious liberties for all. It is, of course, an exclusively Protestant  organisation that honours the memory of all those who, through many centuries,  cherished the pursuit of liberty, equality and freedom to worship, according to  one&rsquo;s conscience.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Orange Order bases all its teachings and actions on the  teachings of holy scripture, which it accepts as the supreme authority on all  matters relating to Christian life and teaching. It supports and seeks to  uphold the constitution and monarchy of the United Kingdom, and is no more  political or exclusive in nature than the Roman Catholic Church or the Ancient  Order of Hibernians.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Throughout Northern Ireland  &mdash; and indeed in the Republic   of Ireland &mdash; there are  many Orange Halls, which perform an important social function. They are not  only used for lodge meetings, but as an important resource for a multitude of  community groups, clubs and organisations.  It is reprehensible that those buildings &mdash; which support activity at the  heart of Protestant, unionist and Ulster-Scots life &mdash; should be subject to  constant and apparently organised sectarian attacks. Often, during those  attacks, vandals and arsonists destroy priceless historical records, artefacts,  lodge banners and memorabilia. Such attacks do not destroy the spirit of  Orangeism &mdash; on the contrary, they make members more determined than ever to  develop their distinctive culture and heritage.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In a recent letter from the PSNI, I received statistics  that showed that, in 2005-06, there were 62 recorded attacks on Orange Halls.  In the past year, that number has escalated to more than 70. By contrast, in  the past two years, there has been only one recorded attack on an Ancient Order  of Hibernians building.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: In  my constituency of Newry and Armagh, there have probably been more attacks on  Orange Halls than anywhere else in Northern Ireland. In the run-up to  the Twelfth of July period this year, there were three such attacks. Does the  Member agree that many Orange Halls are used by community groups and religious  organisations, and therefore the attacks on them are seen locally as attacks on  the wider Protestant community?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  concur with my colleague on all those points. Attacks on Orange Halls and on  churches have cost taxpayers &pound;4 million in the last five years. It is also  reprehensible that any organisation &mdash; orange or green, Protestant or Roman  Catholic, unionist or nationalist &mdash; should  be on the receiving end of wanton destruction and damage. However, to  the unionist community, it seems that Orange Halls are being singled out as a  target by members of the nationalist/republican community.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It has not been an easy road for the unionist people over the last 40 years. They believe that they  have been on the receiving end of a vicious, violent and sectarian  assault on the physical and commercial infrastructure of the Province, the  institutions of Government, and their lives. In those years, unionists have  always found it difficult to imagine what perceived or real problems existed in  Northern Ireland  that could have justified such a prolonged and determined campaign of terror,  which resulted in the loss of so many lives. It has been difficult too that, in  the cause of peace, we have to sit in  Government with Sinn F&eacute;in /IRA. We have reluctantly accepted that that  is part of the price that we must pay to shape a peaceful and prosperous future  for all our children. However, it is vital in this new dispensation that there  is tolerance and respect for all our distinctive Orange, unionist and British culture.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, we will hear much about equality, justice, respect  and a shared future. We are often lectured by Members opposite on those very  principles &mdash; almost to the point that one might think that nationalists and  republicans subscribe to such principles.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Parity of esteem is a  two-way process. It is incumbent on all nationalist and republican  politicians and community leaders to use  their influence to stop elements of their community from directing  sectarian aggression against the Loyal Orders. The displays of violence and  hatred directed against Orange Halls in particular must be stopped.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps someone from Sinn F&eacute;in can explain why a member of  that party was caught on the roof of an Orange Hall in Newcastle in recent weeks. Did he think that  he was Spiderman or Superman, or did he merely want to admire the Union Jack?  What action will Sinn F&eacute;in take against that party member? Sinn F&eacute;in has failed  to educate its people, and it has failed to stop those in its community carrying  out attacks on Orange Halls. Furthermore, its MLAs have failed in their duty as  public representatives to deliver on the matter. It is time for them to  deliver. It is easy to talk the talk, but it is not so easy to walk the walk.  Actions speak louder than words.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I support the content of the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment,  I feel that it was tabled to detract from the motion and the debate on attacks  on Orange Halls. The amendment is a means to detract from the point that the  DUP is trying to make. If the amended motion were tabled as a substantive  motion, I would have no problem supporting it, but I notice that the amendment  does not call on politicians to use their influence to stop sectarian attacks.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Unionists have given much to further the cause of peace in  our Province. There is a huge responsibility on  the nationalist people &mdash; especially on the republican community and its  leaders &mdash; to show that they can respect our rights as British citizens in Northern Ireland  to pursue our culture, cherish our identity and celebrate our distinctive  heritage in an atmosphere of tolerance and respect. Sectarian attacks from any  side of the community on a community facility or hall are wrong. They must stop  now, and republicans must stop them now.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  beg to move the following amend&shy;ment: Leave out &ldquo;all attacks on Orange Halls&rdquo;  and insert after &ldquo;condemns&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;attacks on all homes,  property and community facilities, including Orange Halls,&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I do not agree  with everything that Mr Easton has said, but I welcome the measured way in which he has approached the opening  to the debate. It is, understandably, an emotive issue for Mr Easton as a  member of the Orange Order, and I hope that the debate continues in that tone.  Today, Members want to work out a way in which to ensure that sectarian attacks  against Orange Halls stop.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Sinn F&eacute;in amendment was not tabled to dilute the DUP  motion. I have no difficulty with the content of the motion. The amendment is  to ensure that we encompass sectarianism in society and that Members, as  political leaders, bring it all to an end. We do not want Members to engage in  &ldquo;whataboutery&rdquo; during or after the debate, and ask about incidents that  happened in their area. Today should see the start of a debate on the issue  among Members, as political leaders, and among wider society on how to stop  sectarianism. I agree with Mr Easton: there has been a sustained increase on  attacks against Orange Halls, and those attacks must be condemned and stopped.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Easton mentioned a  newspaper report that alleged that a member of my party was caught on  the roof of an Orange Hall. If anyone produces substantive evidence that proves  that that incident took place, the party will deal with the person involved.  The DUP has its disciplinary procedures, and it has recently had to deal with  several high-profile cases. Matters relating to those cases were before the  judiciary, so the DUP could not proceed with any action until the court cases  had concluded. Mr Easton, therefore, must look at the alleged incident in Newcastle with an open  mind. Sinn F&eacute;in cannot deal with the matter until substantive evidence is  brought forward, and the allegation proven. The PSNI may also conduct a  criminal investigation into the incident, and that would mean that Sinn F&eacute;in  could do nothing until the investigation&rsquo;s completion. The DUP has had to do  that in many instances.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Would the Member support any PSNI investigation into that matter?</p>
		    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair" style="margin-top:6.4pt;margin-right:11.35pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:11.35pt;">(Mr Deputy Speaker  [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  certainly would. I urge everyone who has information on anyone who is involved  in criminal activity against Orange Hall property to give it to the PSNI. I  have no difficulty in saying that. As I said previously, political leaders have  a responsibility on such matters. Mr Easton spoke about tolerance and respect,  and that is what we all must display.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must understand each other better. Sinn F&eacute;in, the DUP  and the Ulster Unionist Party must engage with  each other to change the nationalist and republican community&rsquo;s views of  the Orange Order.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I learnt more about the Orange Order, and what an Orange  Hall is used for, from listening to a five-minute interview on &lsquo;Talkback&rsquo; than  I have from spending 20 years in politics.  The interview was with a young woman who runs a youth centre and a  child&rsquo;s cr&egrave;che in an Orange Hall in Kilmore, which is in my constituency. That  hall was burnt down and was attacked again recently with paint. She spoke for  those five minutes about what she used that Orange Hall for. I came to  understand that it was more of a community facility that had been attacked than  a place that housed the Orange Order. If, after 20 years of being involved in  politics, I can learn that information in five minutes, what could we learn if  we spoke to each other about such matters?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask Members on the other side of the House not to  entrench themselves in the politics of the past. They clearly remain suspicious  of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s motives and lack of leadership where attacks on Orange Halls are  concerned. Although Sinn F&eacute;in has major difficulties with the Orange Order and  its marches, such as that on the Garvaghy    Road, which is also in my constituency, I tell the  House sincerely that my party is serious about stopping attacks on Orange  Halls. Mr Irwin, a DUP Member, intervened to say that such acts of aggression  are seen as attacks on the Protestant community. The halls are used as cr&egrave;ches  and youth clubs, and they are used to host dinners for pensioners. Orange Halls  are used for all those activities that we  in the wider political circles have not provided. Everyone in the House  who represents a rural community knows that no council, or anyone else,  provides community facilities in those areas &mdash; it is either the GAA or the  Orange Order that provides them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I appeal to Members to understand that Sinn F&eacute;in is serious  about stopping attacks on Orange Halls. Members can remain suspicious, but they  should take the extra step of sitting at the table with us so that we can all  discuss &mdash; and find a way to resolve &mdash; the issue. Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s amendment does not  serve to undermine the motion; instead, it encompasses the problem of  sectarianism. We do not have to get involved in &ldquo;whataboutery&rdquo;, but we must  tackle sectarianism and the attacks on Orange Halls head on. Go raibh maith  agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I welcome this important debate. At the outset, I am proud to confirm that I am  a member of the Orange Order in County   Armagh.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It cannot have escaped the Assembly&rsquo;s attention that the  motion is being debated on 9/11, the anniversary of the appalling attacks in  the United States of America that ushered in a new, and very terrible, age of  world terrorism. That new age began at a time when we thought that our own  Troubles were coming to an end. That is why the clear evidence of continuing  sectarian bigotry that manifests itself in attacks on Orange Halls is so  unacceptable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Attacks on Orange Halls represent an attempt by republicans  to intimidate, bully and threaten the unionist and Protestant cultural  tradition. Those attacks are entirely out of place in an age &mdash; and in a new  dispensation &mdash; when all cultural traditions should be mutually respected and  equally valued. It is a &ldquo;Brits out&rdquo; policy taken to one of its most extreme  forms, and it is just not on.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">No tolerance should be shown to those who carry out such  attacks. It does not take much common sense to see that they could cost the  Province the prosperity to which it is entitled after so many hard years of conflict.  We must not &mdash; and cannot &mdash; give the mindless cavemen and women who carry out  those attacks any opportunities to jeopardise the relative peace that we now  enjoy. Their actions have no place in any decent society. That is why there is  no reason to protect the people who carry out those attacks. They are dangerous  people who must be apprehended and convicted by being given long prison  sentences. Communities must not shield them, and republican political leaders  must demonstrate their credibility as peacemakers by making every effort to  have those responsible handed over to the lawful authorities &mdash; the PSNI. That  means that all the community influence that a political party wields, which, in  some cases is considerable, must be used in stopping for good attacks on Orange  Halls.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">None of us can be half in or half out of the process &mdash; an &agrave;  la carte approach to law and order only when it suits, and when it does not  upset any of our supporters. There is nothing more insidious and damaging to  the whole political process here than a partial application of the principles  of law and order. Make no mistake: the world is watching. Every attack on an  Orange Hall and every sectarian incident is logged by overseas investors and  reported in the world&rsquo;s press in the most unlikely places. The eyes that are  scrutinising those events are not casual observers &mdash; they are potential  investors. We had better take notice and listen when they ask whether the  Troubles have really stopped.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot afford to have a society frayed around the edges,  with the residue of lawlessness hanging over it from its troubled past. Our  potential to attract inward investment must not be harmed. The best way to effectively marginalise individuals or groups who  indulge in attacks on Orange Halls is  to inform the police &mdash; that is the  way to deal with these activities. If the nationalist and republican  communities were to do that, it would help  to build a lasting peace and to convince the unionist-minded community  that nationalists and republicans are sincere about a shared future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I heard what Mr O&rsquo;Dowd the Member for Upper   Bann said, but actions are needed at this stage, not words. No one  who wants peace and order in a new shared-future  society will want these attacks to continue. The many hundreds of attacks  over the years, which bizarrely accelerated after the original IRA ceasefire,  leading right up to the attacks this summer, do nothing to create a just or  lasting peace.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are few things that really annoy the unionist people more than the deliberate act of malicious  damage against their Orange Halls, which effectively serve as community  halls, whether in Carnagh, Crosskeys or Mullintur  &mdash; halls attacked this year in my constituency &mdash; or in Seagoe, outside  Portadown, which is home to the most recently destroyed hall in County Armagh.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I say to those in the House, particularly republicans: stop  burning our Orange Halls and start building real peace.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: The SDLP chose not to table an amend&shy;ment because it felt that  the proposers of the motion had a valid point to make and we did not want to  dilute that in any way. However, since an  amendment has been tabled, the SDLP will support it, because we  recognise the range of attacks on various community premises.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Like other Members, I have spent a fair bit of my political  life standing at the scenes of attacks on private houses, schools, churches and  sports grounds &mdash; including GAA grounds. They were often premises owned by Catholics or related to the Catholic  community, but that was not always the case. I am aware of the full range of attacks on many community premises.  However, I accept that a genuine and valid issue has been raised by the  proposers of the motion in relation to attacks on Orange Halls, and the figures  speak for themselves.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Lavin Orange Hall,  which is not far from Ballymoney, is in my constituency. It was burned  out on 12 July 2006 and, until recently, it remained as a burned-out shell. I have driven past it many times. The more  I drove past it, the more I thought that the burned-out shell of the  hall was a very eloquent statement of how wrong it is to burn down such  premises. It highlighted the fractured state of the community. Politicians have  a job to do to put that right, and I will talk about that later.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad to see that site work recently started on Lavin  Orange Hall; however, the period of time during which the ruin stood served as a statement of significant value.  Members must not forget that message.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the nationalist community, we can see that there is more of a two-way problem with sectarianism  than we might have conceded in the past. Largely, sectarianism was seen as something that Protestants did to  Catholics. That overview was not  without some validity. However, when Members consider recent events in  their local communities, many incidents have given cause for concern. In many  cases, those acts are committed by young  people with antisocial motives, who often attach labels to themselves &mdash;  almost as flags of convenience.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that some of those incidents are deliberately  sectarian and specifically anti-Protestant by nature, and are a cause of shame  to those of us who come from the Catholic community. Significant as they are,  there is a danger that people can read in too much of a conspiracy theory, or  attach a republican label to <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">those  incidents. I am aware that antisocial elements in my</span> area have attached  republican and dissident republican names to themselves that have little basis  in reality. However, there is a problem with sectarianism that all Members must  face.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the recent work of the Orange Order, which is  changing significantly, and Members must allow it space to continue to change.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In this debate, Members utter a message to the community,  but we must, furthermore, utter a message to ourselves. Members of the Assembly  are important leaders of the community, and what we do here will send important  signals to the rest of the community.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  Naturally, the Alliance Party supports the motion. In doing so, it expresses  mild disappointment that it goes only as far as mentioning Orange Halls.  However, Mr Easton is entitled to make that specific point, and the Alliance  Party does not disagree. At the same time, it supports the amendment, because  it &mdash; correctly &mdash; expands the demand for condemnation to all types of community  facility, including homes and property. I note that the amendment does not call  on all political parties to use their influence. The Alliance Party&rsquo;s amendment  did that, but it was not accepted.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  To clarify that point, I have checked with the Speaker&rsquo;s Office, and the Sinn  F&eacute;in amendment includes the last line: &ldquo;all political parties to use their  influence to stop such sectarian attacks.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  am glad that the Member clarified that point. That is good news.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment extends to all homes and property. It is not  necessary to specify every type of property, but, by implication, churches are  included.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Attacks on Orange Halls are disgraceful, not only in the  damage that is done, but in the outrage, hurt and tension that they cause. That  is precisely what is in the minds of the perpetrators when they do such things.  Physical damage can be restored. I acknowledge the point concerning banners and  memorabilia, which are much more difficult to restore &mdash; some are lost for ever.  However, the damage to the community is long-lasting. That applies whether the  attack is on an Orange Hall, GAA hall, church, chapel or any other type of  facility, including a home.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A few days ago, in my area of Dunmurry, an attack,  involving a pipe bomb, caused substantial damage to a small Housing Executive  home. The fact that the house contained  only female adults, one of whom is in the advanced stages of dementia,  and a child who suffers from cerebral palsy, did not make any difference to the  attackers. They probably regarded it as a  bonus, because it increased both the  publicity generated and community tension, which is what they wanted.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Since 2000, the Alliance Party has pushed for the NIO to  introduce comprehensive hate crime legislation similar to that in England and Wales,  and it was finally introduced through the Criminal Justice (No. 2) (Northern    Ireland) Order 2004. I am sure that Members are familiar with it, but  its main provisions are: first, where an offence involves hostility based on  religion, race, sexual orientation or disability, on conviction, the court must  take that into account when sentencing; and secondly, the court&rsquo;s sentencing  powers in relation to specified crimes of  violence are increased. For example, the maximum sentence for putting  someone in fear of violence increases from five years to seven years and the  maximum sentence for criminal damage increases from 10 years to 14 years.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Such legislation, I am told, has been widely used in England, Wales  and Scotland  and is highly relevant to the type of attacks that we are talking about.  Members may correct me if I am wrong, but I cannot remember a case in which  that legislation has been specifically invoked. Has anyone who has been charged  with criminal damage also been prosecuted for it as an aggravated offence under  the hate crimes legislation? The Assembly should be looking at that as a matter  of urgency. If we cannot stop the attacks, much as I wish that we could, at  least we might be able to properly punish the perpetrators when they are  caught.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party condemns all attacks, whether they are  against Orange Halls, Hibernian halls, GAA clubs, churches or homes. I am sure  that all Members will agree. However, I  hope that the proposers of the motion  might now be inclined to accept the amendment. It does not dilute the  motion in any way; it simply, and correctly, adds another layer to it. The Alliance Party supports the motion and the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  By bringing this motion before the House, the proposers have attempted to focus  directly on Orange Halls. We are not saying or implying that there have been no  attacks on private homes or other properties. We have sought the opportunity to  bring a specific issue before the House. Unfortunately, Sinn F&eacute;in has tried to  thwart that &mdash; not for the first time, I suspect; nor the last.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have a list in my hand, which reads as a litany of attacks on Orange Halls. It details 276 attacks  on Orange Halls across Northern    Ireland, and it dates back to that infamous day in 1975 when five members of the Orange  Order were murdered in their Orange Hall in  Tullyvallen.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have another list of 32 attacks of a different nature,  but, ultimately, they are all attacks on Orange Halls, which can be read as  attacks on the Protestant comm&shy;unity. I suspect that if such attacks were  happening on the opposite side, there would be a cry to high heaven. However,  Orange Halls are just not that important.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to Mr O&rsquo;Dowd. He went to the trouble of tabling  an amendment; he sought to colour the whole debate by saying that attacks are  not only carried out on Orange Halls. That is correct; other properties are  being attacked and destroyed also.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we are specifically dealing with Orange Halls, the  list of attacks on which is endless. That does not happen by accident. Headlines such as &ldquo;Shinner falls off Orange hall roof&rdquo;, in the &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo; of 31  August, hardly instil confidence in the unionist and Protestant  communities and in those who hold to Orange  culture.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I fully accept that there is a due process that has to be  gone through. However, actions will always speak louder than words, and Sinn  F&eacute;in has not come up to the mark on this issue, but has deliberately dragged its  feet. It strikes me, as it strikes others who come from the same culture and  background as I do, that Sinn F&eacute;in sees this matter as not being that  important. Yes, Sinn F&eacute;in will condemn  attacks &mdash; but it must do more. It must show, in an emphatic way, that it  is against such behaviour, and it must totally support the police in bringing  to court and to justice those who indulge in such attacks.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan said that the SDLP had not tabled an amendment. I  took heart from that, but he discouraged me immediately with his next phrase,  in which he said that the SDLP was going to support the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment. I  thought that, for once, the SDLP was going to show a bit of courage, distance  itself from Sinn F&eacute;in for a turn, and stand out as different. Mr O&rsquo;Loan went on  to cite an Orange Hall that stands as an epitaph to hatred. It has been burned  out, and the remaining shell is a striking testimony to what is going on in our  society. What a pity that he did not say that, for that very reason, the SDLP would support the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion deals directly with attacks on Orange Halls.  Here is an opportunity for all those who feel that they cannot come out and say  that this must stop. Of course it must stop, along with all attacks on church  halls and other such buildings. I do not care what side of the community those  attacks come from; I have never been lacking in my condemnation of attacks on  church halls, GAA halls, or any other community halls. I have stood up and  sought to give leadership. I say to the nationalist representatives in the  House that this is their chance: their golden opportunity to give real  leadership and acknowledge that it is Orange Halls that we are dealing with,  and the attacks must stop.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom taca&iacute;ocht a  thabhairt don leas&uacute;. I support the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in condemns all sectarian attacks utterly and  without reservation. I want to make it clear that attacks on Orange Halls are  wrong. Attacks on Protestant and Catholic homes are wrong, and attacks on  places of worship are wrong. There is no equivocation; all sectarian attacks  are wrong. I want to make that clear so that there is no confusion in the  Assembly today. Anyone who has information about sectarian attacks should go to  the PSNI. Whether sectarian attacks are made directly against young people, old  people, their homes, or families who wish to live in peace with their  neighbours or pray in their respective churches, they are equally wrong, and  destructive of all that we are trying to  build through the institutions of power sharing.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in condemns sectarianism as the cancer that lies at the very root of the injustice and impoverishment  of our communities, which our Executive are,  above all, dedicated to changing. However, condemnation is easy and  cheap. Sinn F&eacute;in has long declared that political parties must give leadership in their communities. When members  of political parties attempt to approach all issues along sectarian lines, they  are creating the conditions that fuel sectarianism in our community. Some people, including Members of the Assembly, have  contributed to keeping the two communities apart.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Orange Order also  has a responsibility. Commit&shy;ment to the power-sharing Executive means that we make  an honest and open effort to transcend the differences that have divided us in the past and promote the interests of  all people equally. We must not allow any attempt to bury sectarianism, when it  stares us in the face, and pretend that it no longer exists. It is important  that we face reality &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Members, please return to your seats.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  It is important that we face reality and do not attempt to bury racist or  sectarian crimes under a catch-all category of hate or knife crimes. We will  not advance the important battle against sectarian&shy;ism through denial.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are all aware of a litany of sectarian crimes: the murders of the Quinn children and of Michael  McIlveen, and the attempted murder of young Paul McCauley from Derry, who is fighting for his life as we sit here in the  Chamber. Whether it is areas such as the Fountain in Derry that are the focus or origin  of sectarian attacks, there is one question that we must all answer: how  can we bring sectarian crime to an end?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members have stated that they wish to see action. Sinn F&eacute;in  has drawn up a charter for unionist engage&shy;ment.  We believe that that could allow us all to move to a humane common ground and give political leadership  in the communities towards delivery for all our people. On the ground, in Derry and elsewhere, there has been dialogue among  communities, politicians and Church leaders. Today, I want to extend an  invitation to the Orange Order &mdash; there are many prominent members of that institution on the Benches opposite &mdash; to  engage in direct dialogue with Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is the duty of the Executive and the Assembly to promote tolerance, inclusivity and equality, to  eradicate sectarianism, racism and other forms of discrimination, and to  promote a pluralist society in which difference is celebrated and cultural  diversity is encouraged. Sinn F&eacute;in believes that that is the best way in which  to achieve common ground.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong><span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">Mr Deputy Speaker</span></strong>: Order.  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  I support the amendment. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Members will know that the Business Committee has arranged to meet  as soon as the Assembly suspends for lunch. I propose, therefore, by leave of  the Assembly, to suspend the sitting until 2.00 pm.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.28 pm.<span style="font-style:normal; "> </span></p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)  &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  was greatly surprised to hear some of Mr O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s comments this morning. He  said that he had learnt more about the Orange Order from a five-minute radio  interview than he had at any other time in his life. He must think that Members  on this side of the House are naive. That statement makes me wonder what  sources he uses for his speeches.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion reflects an important issue for the Protestant  community. The Orange Order represents that community&rsquo;s cultural identity and  embodies Christian principles such as charity and tolerance. Sinn F&eacute;in puts about a myth that the Orange Order comprises  bowler-hatted bigots who just want to march down the road. However, over  generations, the Orange Order has played a significant role in society, and its  members have made important contributions. Such members include: Dr Thomas Barnardo; William Massey, a former Prime  Minister of New Zealand; Harry Ferguson, the inventor of the tractor; and Earl  Alexander of Tunis,  a First World War general. Those people represent the calibre of person who  underpins the character and ethos of the Orange Order and maintains its  principles.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is sad that many Orange Halls have been attacked. That is not a recent phenomenon; the trend started  in, and has accelerated since, the 1960s. It had one objective: the  cultural annihilation of the Protestant community. Republicans thought that  such aggression against the Orange Order&rsquo;s facilities and halls was the best  way to attack Protestantism and Orange  culture. However, that is only because republicans have perceived the Orange  Order as being a major part of the British presence in Ulster. There  have been numerous attacks on Orange Halls across Northern Ireland &mdash;260 since 1989.  Approximately 14 halls are burnt every year, which equates to more than one a  month. The Orange Order estimates that 311 of its members who are current or  former members of the security forces have been targeted and cruelly murdered  because they were Protestants and members of the Orange Institution.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In my own constituency, such attacks have been occurring  since the 1960s. In two instances, attacks were  mounted from the grounds of St Matthew&rsquo;s chapel. However, I am not in  any way blaming the priests who were in  charge of the chapel on either of those occasions. A council colleague  of mine, May Campbell, was shot and wounded  in one of those attacks. Those assaults were part of a process of ethnic  cleansing that culminated in severe attacks on the small Protestant enclave of Cluan Place on the Albertbridge Road.  Such attacks, and those against Orange Halls, are all part of the same  orchestrated campaign of aggression.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As sickening and bigoted as the attacks on Orange Order  property and the murder of its members are, it is more appalling that a party  whose Members sit on the other side of the Chamber glorifies those deeds by  naming, and turning into heroes, those who have murdered and attacked the Protestant community. Indeed, we witnessed that a few weeks ago in Belfast city centre.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If trust is to be built, the Orange Order must receive a  sincere and unequivocal apology not only for the murders of its members but for the attacks on its property. That  type of bigotry must cease.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to  this debate and, at the outset, I declare an interest. I am a member of  the Orange Institution and proud to be so.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past months, attacks on Orange Halls and on the  orange community in general have escalated. Today we focus on Orange Halls, and  I am pleased to speak about that. However, the Orange  family has suffered greatly as well; over the Twelfth we witnessed flags,  bunting and arches being damaged and ripped from their poles.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It was interesting to  hear Ms Anderson say that people in this Chamber have contributed to  keeping people apart. I agree with her on that; for a generation or more people have bombed, murdered, burned and intimidated  the Protestant community and the Orange family in Northern Ireland. Yes, I agree with  Ms Anderson, and if some people in the Chamber look at themselves they will  perhaps recognise who has contributed to that past and that division in our  community.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Orange Halls and, on many occasions, church halls are used  by a huge list of organisations, such as Cubs, Scouts, Brownies and Guides, as  well as the Women&rsquo;s Institute and credit unions. However, that has not stopped  many in our community from attempting the ethnic cleansing of Protestant  communities throughout Northern    Ireland. I have referred to that on many occasions. It is relevant in my constituency of  Fermanagh and South Tyrone, and more so in Armagh, parts of Belfast and the greater Belfast area, where people just &ldquo;do not want  a Prod about the place&rdquo;. Sometimes it is as simple as that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am heartened by Mr O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s comments and by his  recognition of the Orange culture and  tradition in this Province.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The upkeep and  maintenance of Orange Halls is often difficult enough, and represents a  significant financial investment from local people. Volunteers give of their free time to ensure that the premises are  maintained to a very high standard and can be used by other organ&shy;isations  which, on many occasions, have nothing at all to do with the Orange Order.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd said that he  had learned about the Orange Order and the use of Orange Halls from a  five-minute interview on the radio. I wonder how much effort and emphasis Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd put in to finding out anything about the Orange Institution and the use  of Orange Halls before he heard that broadcast. Over the last few years, as a  representative of the Orange Institution, I have engaged in several discussions  and debates on community relations and  cultural diversity. Many of the people involved were from what I call  &ldquo;the opposite tradition&rdquo;, from such organisations as the GAA.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the run-up to this year&rsquo;s Twelfth of July celebra&shy;tions,  I, with other community representatives, worked extremely hard to ensure that the various marches in my constituency could take place as a spectacle for  everyone to enjoy, irrespective of  religious persuasion. I am pleased that, in Fermanagh and South Tyrone,  the Twelfth celebration was enjoyed by everyone who attended.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">No-one should be under any illusion; these matters require  further work from all parts of the political spectrum. My experience is that  the Orange Order has become increasingly accommodating and willing to work  with, and in, communities. That must be seen and respected by Government. On many occasions, positive plans and  proposals by the Orange Institution for the benefit of the future leadership,  responsibilities and community role of the Orange Order have met with a mixed  response.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On a few occasions, people working for the Orange Order  received a positive approach. However, on many occasions, they have not even had a reply to their request. Many  of those requests and proposals would benefit the entire community, not just  the Orange Order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I am saddened to think that we even have to discuss such a subject, given that  we are supposed to be living in a new political era that should give rise to  only peacefulness, prosperity and genuine cross-community collaboration.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In this new political era, we, as politicians, must remember that we are measured not only by our  actions but by our words. An attack  on any community building &mdash; in this case, on Orange Halls &mdash; is an attack  on the entire community. Orange Halls can  be, and are currently being, used for cross-community purposes such as  playschools where, in some areas, children from both sides of the community  come together to learn and to play. Perhaps we should all go back to that age,  where creed, colour and denomination play no part in deciding whether we  participate with one another.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I feel that it is best  to leave this issue with an example from Cavan in the South of Ireland.  When an Orange Hall was vandalised and put beyond use, Catholics and Protestants collaborated to rebuild the hall. The  Govern&shy;ment saw fit to encourage those actions and gave grant aid of &euro;30,000 to complete the project, as should  happen in any civilised society. The Orange Hall was rebuilt and  re-established.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, let us today encourage cross-community  condemnation of attacks on any community building, and let us not dwell on the  past. I hope that we have all learnt something about progressing the issue and  that, most importantly, we learn to respect all buildings, irrespective of who  owns or uses them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I wish to declare an interest as a member of Kircubbin LOL 1900. The Orange  Order stands for religious and civil liberty: religious liberty for everyone,  Protestant or Catholic; and civil liberty for everyone, irrespective of  political affiliation, where they attend on Sundays or where they work.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that the figures for attacks on Orange  Halls draw a vivid, colourful and disturbing picture. Since 1989, there have  been 260 reported attacks &mdash; over 14 every year. The number of attacks in 2007  is higher than in the past seven years. We are supposed to be moving forward,  but some people are trying to take us backwards.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The severity of the attacks has varied, ranging from  tearing down flags to vandalising halls. Sectarianism in any shape or form  cannot be an acceptable part of the business of this country, and the Assembly  must support the intent of the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that I am not the only Member who has heard the  story about the Shinner falling off the roof. As absurd as the situation was,  it is understandable that some people might  think that it is the first line of a joke. In reality, it is not a joke;  it is a very serious matter. Tearing down a flag from an Orange Hall is an act  of vandalism and disrespect. It is no laughing matter to the member of the lodge who paid for the flag or  handed it down from his father&rsquo;s time. It is not a joke that part of  that hall&rsquo;s history was torn down in a moment by an act of contempt. To the  women who sewed the flag to show pride in their culture and heritage, it is  nothing less than an insult &mdash; a slap in the face. That kind of action is not an  isolated matter; the Orange Order and Orange  Halls face the same problem, month after month.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those events are not unconnected. Recently, there was an  attack on Seagoe Orange Hall in Portadown. The hall had just been refurbished  at a cost of &pound;15,000. That is not the only instance of a refurbished hall being  burnt down in order to make a statement.  Such behaviour might have been expected in the 1970s, but it has no  place in Northern Ireland  today. The hall is used not only by the Orange Lodge but by local people for  community programmes and events.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">How many times have we watched members of the public on  television, sifting through the rubble of a hall to see what part of their  history could be recovered? The answer is a very sober one: far too many. For  too long the Orange Order and the halls have been used by many as scapegoats  for their anger, fear and malice. For too long the Orange Order and the halls  have had to accept their lot of damage and wanton destruction to their property  &mdash; and even worse has been done to history. I read the words of Fr Martin  McAlinden, the parish priest of Moyraverty near to Seagoe Orange Hall, and I  fully agree with what he said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The destruction of a  building that represents the culture of a particular group in this area is  shameful and an attack on the Orange Order and  the community of Seagoe.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I suggest to Members who have spoken and made a commitment  that they tell the police what they know and encourage their supporters to tell  the police what they know. Give us the proof of the pudding by eating it. Show  us what you can do. The hall at Seagoe was not a place of hate; it was a place  of history. It was not a place of war; it was a place of life, and those who  destroyed it destroyed a little part of their community. Such behaviour is  nothing less than shameful and disgusting, and the Assembly must unite and  proclaim it as such.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As well as that, those who are affiliated with the Assembly  should treat it with the respect and reverence that all members of the  community believe should be given. All parties must stand by their words and  ensure that those who are caught in any form  of attack, whether it be chanting sectarian slogans, breaking windows,  tearing down flags or engaging in more sinister behaviour, are reported to the  police. Terrorism in any guise will not be tolerated, and it is the  responsibility of the Assembly to take steps to end that form of terrorism by  more than mere words. There must be no more cowardly attacks on culture and  heritage by intolerant and bigoted people determined to destroy something  merely because they cannot stand, or accept, a right to the celebration of the  history of this nation. I support the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  At the outset, I declare that I am a proud member of Corcreeny LOL 91 in the  district of Lurgan.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sadly, attacks on Orange Halls in Northern Ireland  are nothing new. As figures show, the systematic targeting of halls has been to  the fore of the republican campaign for many years. In the early 1990s when IRA  activity was rampant throughout our land, the average number of attacks on  Orange Halls each year was 15. Yet, strangely enough, after the 1994 ceasefire  the number of attacks rose to an average of 40 each year, a figure that is  being exceeded at present.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Brownlow House Orange Hall, in my Upper   Bann constituency, the world  headquarters of the Royal Black Institution, has come under sustained  attack and has been severely damaged on numerous occasions. I want to pay  tribute to the brethren for restoring this glorious building, part of which  dates back to the seventeenth century. Last weekend Brownlow House played host  to hundreds of visitors of all faiths as part of the Environ&shy;ment and Heritage  Service&rsquo;s open day programme.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Eight Orange Halls have already been attacked in County Armagh  this year. I think particularly today of Seagoe Orange Hall, which my colleague  referred to. It was seriously damaged only a few weeks ago. I think too of  Kilmore Orange Hall in the countryside near  Lurgan that was gutted by fire last year. It has been there for over 200  years, and I am delighted that it was reopened on Saturday last after an  intense programme of work by the brethren and in spite of a recent paint bomb  attack.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Kilmore Orange Hall is used almost daily and is the hub of  an isolated rural community. It is used by both sections of the community. The  brethren there seek to offend no one. They want to live peacefully and enjoy their culture. Like many lodges throughout the  Province, Kilmore has raised thousands of pounds for charity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, we have heard of Sinn F&eacute;in councillors turning up  at Orange halls in the aftermath of attacks to  sympathise with Orangemen while, on the other hand, Sinn F&eacute;in members have been  reportedly falling off the roofs of Orange Halls in other constituencies in the  early hours of the morning.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members of the Orange Order do not need the sympathy of Sinn F&eacute;in politicians. We need them to  take action, and after incidents such as the one at Newcastle Orange  Hall the following question needs to be asked: &ldquo;What sanctions will the Sinn  F&eacute;in leadership take against the people involved?&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s work on the ground created the likes of  Breand&aacute;n Mac Cionnaith, who now single-handedly holds up progress on a resolution to the Drumcree parade dispute.  The policies, actions and example of Sinn F&eacute;in made attacks on Orange Halls acceptable to some people. That is  why words are not enough on this occasion. Can Sinn F&eacute;in truly live in peace  with its neighbours? Only time will tell. Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s response to issues such  as this will go a long way towards answering that question. It is entirely up  to Sinn F&eacute;in to act now.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the legacy of  attacks that have been inflicted on it, the Orange  culture is alive, strong, vibrant and here to stay.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I too declare an interest as a loyal and proud member of the Orange  Institution. Only a few hours ago, the House came together to reject  sectarianism and racism in sport. However, here we are, with some Members  unable to reject outright the sectarianism that is under debate and which lies  behind attacks on Orange Halls. Those Members are unable to stand together, as  we did a few hours ago, behind the single-issue motion before the House. Going  by the comments of some Members, they are, patently and regrettably, unwilling,  so far, to combine to use their influence to put an end to those attacks. I  hope that those Members will think again.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I, here and now, on this single issue, offer a choice to  those who support the amendment. Show to my community &mdash; the Protestant,  unionist and Orange  community &mdash; a preparedness to demonstrate in this, the House of the people,  that they will work with all parties and bring their influence to bear. The  choice is theirs to take today; I make no demands of them. I ask them to be  reasonable, because they ask me to swallow that which they have brought to this  House: a new era of reasonableness. I honestly say that I find a lot of that  hard to swallow, just yet. However, if the begin&shy;ning that I see here &mdash; and  some of it is unbelievable to many from my tradition &mdash; of a Democratic Unionist  First Minister and a Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy First Minister working together is to be  the way forward until the next time that the electorate meets to make its mark,  I ask Members opposite to take a step forward by setting aside what I can  understand they find great difficulty in letting go. Will they stand together  with us and condemn attacks on Orange Halls?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We all reject attacks on homes, schools, churches &mdash; attacks  on society. However, from the perspective of our tradition, attacks on Orange  Halls are an attack on the Orange family. Only  by being a member of that family can I ask  Members to appreciate what it means to me.  Attacks on Orange Halls are attacks on communities that come together in  that greater family.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have heard things said in this House that I find  unbelievable. I hear a big play for corporate decisions: that is what this Assembly must bring to Northern Ireland politics. I heard junior Minister Paisley applauded  by Members opposite for saying not once but twice in the House that he is  representing a caring Executive. I want the House to tell everyone that,  collectively, we care about attacks on Orange Halls.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This morning, there was  a call for leadership. On this matter, it is over to those in republican  and nationalist seats to show us in the  unionist seats some real leadership.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I say: do it, and be prepared for a response from the  family that I and many here are proud to represent. At this moment, the  amendment smacks of begrudgery, and I sincerely ask Members opposite to  withdraw it. Make today&rsquo;s decision a collective one. Members can return to what  they need to say about attacks on other properties,  and we will join with them. This is a specific issue, and I ask Members  &mdash; humbly &mdash; to stand with us and send a signal that we can take to our people  and that they can take to theirs.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister) (Mr G  Kelly)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. I appreciate the opportunity to respond to the  motion on behalf of the Executive. I unreservedly condemn attacks on Orange  Halls. I was taken by the words of the Member who spoke previously. There is a  unified voice from the Executive on this issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are totally committed to moving society forward and to  making a real difference to the lives of all our people. I am sure that all  parties in the House share the vision for a future based on tolerance,  equality, mutual respect and respect for the rule of law. Many Members have  spoken precisely on those subjects.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no place for the type of behaviour that we have  been discussing today if we are to build a society in which there is respect  for all cultures and traditions. That applies equally to racist attacks on the  houses of members of ethnic minority communities; attacks on the places of  worship of those with different faiths; and on any venue with cultural  purposes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A few weeks ago, the Assembly debated a motion on the  shared future framework document. During that debate, our vision of that shared  future was spelled out by the First  Minister, who said that the dream of people living together in harmony  can and must become more than a dream; it  must become a reality. The First Minister said that we need a stable  society in which:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;children can play together, in which people can work  together, and in which families can live happily side by side, regardless of  their community or ethnic background or their religious beliefs.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Vol 22, No 8, p295, col 2].</span></span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In every society, how people live together is a major  challenge for Governments and individuals. For a society that is moving out of  conflict, that challenge is all the greater. However, we can draw positives as  to how our society is changing from our current political dispensation. This  institution and the Executive point the way forward for this society. Building  an equal and inclusive society is an Executive commitment, and if we are to  deliver real and equitable improvement in the lives of local people, we must  deliver real and tangible change. That will  mean physically regenerating interface areas, providing decent housing  for those in need, and building new relationships across society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise the point that Mr Kennedy made earlier. Our  desire for a prosperous society, which benefits everyone, is not helped by any sectarian or racist attack.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We all know that a more tolerant, more inclusive and more  cohesive society will not happen overnight. There is no magic ointment that can  be applied or pill that can be taken that will produce instant harmony. The fact remains that there are differences in  our society. That is not a bad thing, as some would have us believe. In my view, differences must be recognised, appreciated  and celebrated. The view of the world that, with an end to conflict, everyone  here should share exactly the same values, views and aspirations is wrong. We  need to create a society in which people can feel comfortable expressing their  views, opinions and aspirations, and where  institutions such as the Assembly can give expression to them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my view, everyone has a responsibility and a role to  play in creating such a society. Those of us who are here through the vote of  the electorate must reciprocate the faith with which the people who voted for  us have entrusted us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must see this through. By making Government work and by  building a shared society, we pledge to do all in our power to ensure that our  work makes a real difference to the lives of all the people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The challenges and opportunities that our position affords  are immense in their potential, not only for us, but for generations to come.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sectarianism, racism and intolerance still exist, but <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">they will remain only if we let them. That is why  a</span>ttacks on homes, businesses, Orange Halls, other buildings belonging to  the Loyal Orders, GAA premises, and all <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">other  cultural and religious premises must be cond</span>emned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have  already recognised the importance of creating that new society. The  First Minister and the Deputy First Minister underscored their commitment to building a new inclusive society through their  unequi&shy;vocal statements that  intolerance, sectarianism and racism <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">&mdash;  or violence because of them &mdash; have no place in th</span>is or any other  society. The First Minister and the Deputy First  Minister have demonstrated their personal commit&shy;ment to supporting  people who are the victims of sectarianism  or racist attacks and those who assist them <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">in the aftermath of those attacks. For example, fo</span>llowing an attack on premises there, Martin McGuinness  visited Rev Peter Thompson in St Patrick&rsquo;s Church of Ireland  in Donaghmore. In May, Dr Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness hosted two  receptions &mdash; the first in this Building since restoration of the institutions &mdash;  for representatives of minority and ethnic groups, as well as for those from  the community and voluntary sectors who are involved in that important work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Whereas it is the responsibility of the PSNI and the courts  to deal with the perpetrators of attacks, there is work for us all in helping  to stop attacks on premises that have important cultural value for our people  and communities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Through promoting cohesion and diversity, and through  building good relations among the different  sections of our community, and between communities and Government, we  will tackle the root causes of the problems that manifest themselves in  sectarian and racist attacks. That process will require much hard work and  commitment, but it is necessary work from which, I am sure, no party in the  Assembly will shy away. Attacks on symbolic premises can serve as a barometer  of the state of community relations, and it is worrying that there is an  overall upward trend in the number of those attacks in the six years up to  2005, and thereafter, although the number of attacks remains relatively small.  The attacks were on Orange Halls, churches and chapels, GAA and Ancient Order  of Hibernian properties, and schools. The Executive are closely monitoring the  problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A clear and tangible sign of the Assembly&rsquo;s commit&shy;ment to  the new future is the way in which we conduct our business to build a better  future for everyone. I acknowledge the  concerns that Members raised and will ensure that a copy of today&rsquo;s  Hansard report is sent to the Secretary of State for his information.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I repeat my opening statement that the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister unreservedly condemn  the recent attacks on Orange Halls.  Furthermore, given that the issue was raised by Members on several  occasions, I declare that there is no division in the Executive or in the  Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) over the  propriety of bringing information to the PSNI on any of those attacks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am confident that all the members of the Executive agree  that, if we are to build a society in which there is respect for all cultures  and traditions, there is no place for such behaviour. As I, and other Members,  have said already, condemnation is not enough. We have a responsibility to  build the sort of prosperous and equal society that will ultimately undermine  the mindset that gives rise to those unacceptable attacks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Leadership starts here, Go raibh maith agat. That  leadership has been demonstrated by many Members. Let us continue to  demonstrate it collectively.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: I call Mr John O&rsquo;Dowd to make a  winding-up speech in support of the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  I apologise for being on my feet as you spoke.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The debate has been most interesting. I said earlier that, although the subject is clearly close to his  heart and he has good reason to be emotional, Mr Easton had opened the  debate in a measured way. He opened a debate &mdash; conducted in reasonable terms,  for the most part &mdash; on what we want to achieve. Sinn F&eacute;in did not table the amendment to distract attention from  the issue of attacks on Orange Halls. It is clear that the vast majority  of sectarian attacks on property over the past few years have been on Orange  Halls. That must stop.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is &mdash; <em>[Interruption.] </em>If Gregory would let me  finish, he might be enlightened. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Stop interrupting.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  am sorry. I have lost my train of thought because of Gregory&rsquo;s interruptions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What we want to achieve is a measure of action. Any Member  who proposes a motion or an amendment wants action. He or she wants that issue,  about which he or she cares so deeply, resolved. In this case, we need to stop  attacks on Orange Halls.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For that reason, and because of the reasoned contributions  from across the Chamber, Sinn F&eacute;in withdraws the amendment. Sinn F&eacute;in will not  vote on its amendment, because a message must come from the Chamber today.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>:  Would the Member agree that the amendment has been withdrawn because Sinn F&eacute;in listened intently to what was being said from the  Benches opposite? The attacks on Orange Halls are wrong and should stop.  The perpetrators should be made available to the PSNI and be subject to due  process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If I may, and in the spirit of John&rsquo;s withdrawal of the  amendment, I ask the Members opposite, please, to listen to what Sinn F&eacute;in says  on the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  That is an important point, and I agree with all that my party leader has said.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First Minister  (Rev Dr Ian Paisley)</strong>: I know the feeling  that is in the hearts of all those in the Chamber today. It is a good  thing that the debate dwells on the issue of attacks on Orange Halls. We will  have another opportunity to dwell on other attacks. We are just as much against  the attack on a Roman Catholic place of worship as we are against the attack on  an Orange Hall. The decision from across the Bench will be an encouragement to  people who look to a future in which we come to an end to all of this, and to better  things for our people.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Thank you for that contribution, First Minister. Mr Newton said that I believe  that he and his colleagues are na&iuml;ve. I do not believe for a second that they  are na&iuml;ve; if I did, then I would be na&iuml;ve, and I do not believe myself to be  na&iuml;ve.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are difficult days ahead for all of us involved in the new beginning for politics on the island of Irela<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; ">nd</span>. To be honest, the DUP is not my first  choice for a partner in Government, but the party has been elected, and  I will do everything in my power to ensure that the institutions work and that  the decision of the people is carried through. One Member said that because we  must bring peace to this island, we must make difficult decisions. There are going to be difficult decisions today,  tomorrow, and in the future, and unless all Members start working for a little  bit of trust between parties, those difficult decisions will become  unsurmountable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to attacks on Orange Halls, I recognise the  contribution given by David McNarry. For a moment, I asked myself if the  softly-spoken gentleman in front of me was David McNarry, because it is not  David&rsquo;s usual style, but he made a good contribution.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a responsibility on the Members opposite, just as  much as there is a responsibility on Members on this side, to tackle  sectarianism from within their own communities. Sectarianism must be tackled,  and I acknowledge the contribution that the First Minister made to that in his  comments. We must do it together. The end of today&rsquo;s debate should not be the  end of the subject. We need to work together to end sectarianism, because,  whether it is in sport or society, sectarianism is the biggest hindrance to us  all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, although the amendment will be read out, Sinn F&eacute;in  will not vote on it, and we will support the motion as placed before us.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Like others, I declare an interest, as I have been a member of the Orange Order  for more than 30 years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In proposing the motion Alex Easton said that, in spite of the peace process, there have been more  attacks on Orange Halls in recent years. The number of the attacks and their increasing frequency led to the  proposal of the motion. Although the DUP condemns all attacks on places of worship, or any property, there is a  need to highlight the unique  situation regarding the Orange Halls.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In April 2007, in my  constituency, there was an arson attack on Greencastle Orange Hall on  the Whitewell Road,  which followed an attack that had taken place two months earlier. The hall had  also been targeted by arsonists on three  previous occasions, and was destroyed by arsonists seven years ago. That  situation could be repeated across all constituencies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In his comments, John  O&rsquo;Dowd said that he supports PSNI investigations into attacks on Orange  Halls and said that information should be provided to the police to enable them carry out those investigations. However,  consideration of the cause, the nature and frequency of those attacks suggests  that they are, in large measure, the legacy of decades of demonisation of the  Orange Order by those in the republican community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The other day, on the Oldpark Road &mdash; again, in North  Belfast &mdash; I saw a wooden republican placard of a PSNI officer wearing an Orange collarette, underneath which  said, &ldquo;same old force&rdquo;. If that is the message that republicans send out to  their own community day after day, it is not surprising that people respond to  that message by launching attacks on Orange Halls. The removal of such signs  would be a positive step towards dealing with the problem. John O&rsquo;Dowd asked  what should be done. That is precisely the sort of action that should be taken.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Danny Kennedy talked about the need for a shared future.  That is truly important. A shared future must involve  a place for the Orange Order in cultural life. The streets must be  spaces that the Orange Order can share with others. Declan O&rsquo;Loan gave us a  stark description of a burned-out Orange Hall in his constituency. Lord Morrow  reminded us about how republican terrorists have murdered Orangemen inside  Orange Halls or when leaving them. In the early days of the Troubles, an IRA  sniper shot down the secretary of a lodge when he was leaving Ligoniel Orange  Hall. Subsequently, the hall closed down and the Protestant community moved  down the road. Martina Anderson condemned all sectarian attacks; although, as  one of my colleagues put it, she sounded like Hans Christian Andersen in doing  so. Not everyone shares that particular colleague&rsquo;s sense of humour.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Pious platitudes will  not suffice on this matter. I draw attention  to the point that was made by Mr Newton, who told of a Sinn F&eacute;in parade  that took place in Belfast several weeks ago &mdash; in the centre of a shared city &mdash;  during which IRA terrorists were glorified and were depicted on Sinn F&eacute;in  banners. Those are the type of issues that must be dealt with and where changes  must be made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Orange Order faces a legacy of decades of demonisation,  which had justified sectarian attacks in the minds of republicans. That is  expressed in several ways; for example, in republican opposition to Orange parades. The person on the street in that  community might well ask himself or herself, &ldquo;If I oppose the parade of those  awful people who I do not want to walk down the road in my area, what is the  problem in attacking their hall?&rdquo; That opposition is also expressed in  nationalist criticism of the amount of televised coverage of the Twelfth  celebrations. If the Orange Order should not be on television, what is wrong  with attacking their hall?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Orange Order and its culture must be brought in from  the margins to the mainstream. That can and must be done in many ways; a good  example of which was shown by the Smithsonian Institute&rsquo;s festival in Washington, in which the  Orange Order had a role to play. I also want to commend several schools in the Roman Catholic community, including Abbey Christian  Brothers&rsquo; Grammar School in Newry, which has invited representatives from the  Orange Order to speak to its pupils.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair" style="margin-top:6.4pt;margin-right:11.35pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:11.35pt;">(Mr Deputy Speaker  [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much work must be done. The Orange Order is happy to take  part in that. However, there must be an end to the demonisation of the Orange  Order, which only republicans can bring about.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly condemns  all attacks on Orange Halls and calls on all political parties to use their  influence to stop such sectarian attacks.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="4"></a>National Minimum Wage</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed  to allow one hour and 30 minutes for the debate. The Member proposing the motion will have 10 minutes in which to  speak, with 10 minutes being allowed for the winding-up speech. All other  Members who wish to speak will be allowed a maximum of five minutes.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly opposes  any attempt to replace the national minimum wage with regional variants.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue raised in the motion has the potential to have disastrous consequences for the economic  well-being of Northern    Ireland. At the outset of the debate, it is  safe to assume that Members in the Chamber will universally reject any attempt  to have regional variants of the minimum wage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The introduction of the minimum wage in 1998 was preceded by a debate during which fears were expressed  that it would cost jobs. There is little evidence that it has done so in the UK as a whole.  The minimum-wage scheme has, by and large,  been exceptionally successful. However, over the summer, it has emerged  that our new Prime Minister, Mr Gordon Brown, is considering implementing a  strategy that would end the concept of the national minimum wage and allow the  minimum wage to be regionally variable. Although that proposal has not been  implemented as yet, that does not mean that it will not become a reality.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is probably safe to  assume that, going on the present Labour Government&rsquo;s track record of  cutting wages for public sector workers in areas where the cost of living is  lower, the possibility of their varying the minimum wage may not be a long way  from becoming a real probability. The Prime Minister has undoubtedly been  influenced by research carried out by Professor David Smith of the University of Derby. In a report for the Economic  Research Council he recommends a new variable minimum wage. He recommends that  the UK adopt similar systems  to those in the USA and Switzerland  whereby local authorities set not only the minimum wage, but benefits and the  salaries of public sector workers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Professor Smith&rsquo;s study recommends that the minimum wage  set for Londoners should be increased to &pound;6&middot;90 per hour, while workers in the  north-east would have their hourly rate reduced by 57p to &pound;4&middot;78 per hour. He  recommends that the minimum hourly rate for those in Yorkshire should be  reduced to &pound;4&middot;95 per hour, while in Wales it should be reduced to &pound;4&middot;84  per hour. He also recommends that the minimum wage in Northern Ireland  should be &pound;4.80 per hour.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Should Professor Smith&rsquo;s research be acted upon it would,  potentially, have dangerous consequences for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s economy and our  attempts to get people back to work. Northern Ireland  has an exception&shy;ally high level of  economic inactivity. The Assembly has a  huge job on its hands to get people off welfare benefits and into  employment. Hence, if central Government in London were to introduce regional variants of  the minimum wage it would make that complicated task so much more difficult.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for North Belfast Mr Fred Cobain made an  excellent point recently when he said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Getting people off  welfare and into employment is good for them, good for local communities and  good for our economy. It beggars belief, then, that Gordon Brown should be  considering doing the exact opposite by penalising work.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I agree  wholeheartedly with my hon Friend&rsquo;s comments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is critically important to remember that any variation  in the minimum wage would have to be accompanied by variation in regional rates  of benefits &mdash; particularly that of unemployment benefit. If that were not to  happen then a cut in the minimum wage in Northern Ireland would lead to more  people deciding that it is not worthwhile working. It is reported that Gordon  Brown is now convinced that a common minimum wage &mdash; currently, &pound;5&middot;35 per hour,  rising to &pound;5&middot;52 per hour in October &mdash; is uneconomic.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, just how economic is it to have a lower minimum  wage in this region of the UK,  where we have the largest proportion of economically inactive people as a share  of our potential workforce? The proposal merely removes people&rsquo;s incentive to  find work. That makes absolutely no economic sense. It is preposterous and  reckless.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the main arguments that Professor Smith deploys in order to justify his conclusions is  that the cost of living is lower in Northern   Ireland than elsewhere in the UK, and thus our money supposedly  goes further. However, such an argument is deeply flawed as the figures used to  support it are already out of date &mdash; for example,  he quotes the average house price here as being about &pound;140,000; indeed,  he says that it is &pound;45,000 less than the UK average.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to touch briefly on the effect that those proposals  would have on our attempts to bring more jobs into the Province. Would a lower  minimum wage create more jobs? In theory, anything that lowers costs should  lead to more people being employed. However, the  available labour market data suggest that the impact could be small, and it can legitimately be asked  whether any gain would be worth the associated social cost.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, of what quality would those jobs be, and would they be sustainable? It is important to  keep in mind that pitching low labour costs as our competitive advantage  could never be a long-term objective and that Northern   Ireland simply cannot compete on those terms with India,  China  or some of the African countries. Simply put, proposals to lower the  minimum wage in Northern    Ireland are economically irresponsible and  will do very little to improve the economic prosperity of our people. It would  be a foolish move that would do little to enhance the competitiveness of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  economy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and  Learning (Ms S Ramsey)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I also welcome today&rsquo;s debate and commend the proposers of the motion for  bringing this timely debate to the House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will start by making a few points in my capacity as  Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning, and then I will make  a few personal remarks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposal to replace the minimum wage with regional  variants came to the Committee&rsquo;s attention during the summer recess, in a  meeting that was held on 25 July. It followed recent press reports that have  already been mentioned, so I will not go into them. The Committee expressed  extreme concern about the proposals for the minimum wage for several reasons.  In a letter that I wrote to the Minister for Employment and Learning on 31  July, I stressed the Committee&rsquo;s concerns and asked for the Minister&rsquo;s views on  the matter. The Minister replied to my letter on 16 August, and the Committee  will discuss that reply in its meeting tomorrow.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In his letter, the Minister reminded us that the minimum  wage is a reserved matter, but he stressed that it is of interest to the  Executive, and I welcome that. He assured  me that he strongly opposes the regional variants, and that he will  raise the matter with his Executive colleagues. It is clear from discussions in  Committee and from this debate that there is consensus on the issue. The  Committee will work in support of the Minister &mdash; he will be glad to know that &mdash;  to ensure that any movement towards regionalisation of the minimum wage will be  challenged.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to quote Chris Franks, a Member of the National  Assembly for Wales:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;This proposal should be rejected outright. Low wage  levels in Wales  already contribute to many of the most pressing problems that our communities  face. The minimum wage is vital in lifting people out of poverty and ensuring  equal opportunities are available for all.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The deputy  leader of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP) at Westminster, Stewart Hosie MP, said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;This proposal is barking mad. The SNP campaigned for  years for a minimum wage in order to make work pay and allow people to lift  themselves out of poverty.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that we will  send out the same message today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The minimum wage exists for a reason. Several reports on  poverty have been published in recent times, and  the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister has  produced strategies to combat poverty. However, mechanisms must be put in place  to do just that. There are people working for a minimum wage, some of whom are  working to survive, rather than working to live, and we must examine that situation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is broad acceptance of the need to tackle economic  inactivity and promote equality by using prosperity to target need and existing  patterns of disadvantage. However, if that is true, how will cutting the  minimum wage achieve that stated aim? The minimum wage should be increased so  that people can be allowed to work to live: society and this Assembly should  strive to make that change.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank David McClarty for proposing the motion, and the  Minister for Employment and Learning for coming to the House and listening to  the debate. Given the debates that we have had today and yesterday, I hope that  all parties can agree on the motion and support it. The Committee for  Employment and Learning will be discussing the issue tomorrow and will be  presenting its proposals to the Minister. Go raibh maith agat</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: Like the previous contributor, I congrat&shy;<span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">ul</span>ate  Mr McClarty for proposing the motion. It is timely, in the light of  recent statements made by, and on behalf of, Mr Gordon Brown. It is important to  recognise that back in 1999, the minimum wage, which was designed only to  provide a decent minimum standard, was being used as part of the Labour Party&rsquo;s  election strategy. The minimum wage was an  attempt to provide a degree of fairness in the workplace, and some  semblance, small though it was, of equality of treatment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In making the point about the minimum wage, it should be  realised that various industries pay minimum wages  that are generous, but in the context of a national minimum wage,  although it is to rise on 1 October to &pound;5&middot;52 for persons aged 22 and over, it  will not make its recipients rich or affluent. The situation is even worse for  18 to 21 year olds, who will move from &pound;4&middot;45 to &pound;4&middot;60 an hour, and 16 to 17  year olds, whose hourly wage will rise by 10p to &pound;3&middot;40. It is also important to  note that 16 to 17 year old apprentices are exempt from the minimum wage and  can be paid whatever is agreed with the employer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gordon Brown and his Government have stated that they  are committed to ending child poverty. We cannot address child poverty if, at  the other end of the scale, we attack the parents of those who work in the  lower-wage end of the economy, thereby reducing their wages. All we will do, as  was said on the opposite Benches, is drive  people into the relative poverty trap or the benefits trap, and we all  know how difficult it is to get  economically inactive people out of that state of mind.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Official figures show  that in the United Kingdom, the wages gap between those who are earning  a reasonable wage and those who are at the lower end of the wage economy is  continuing to widen. We have a strong economic base in the UK, but poverty  exists amongst that plenty.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Reference has already  been made to Professor David Smith&rsquo;s  initiative to reduce and regionalise the minimum wage. Northern Ireland, where Professor Smith wishes  to see the minimum wage reduced, has higher levels of housing costs than other  parts of the UK.  Even in the privaterented sector, housing costs in Northern   Ireland are equal to those in the south-east of England, for  which he has proposed an increase to the minimum wage. However, Northern Ireland  also has high costs for bread, fuel and travel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some unscrupulous employers pay below the minimum wage and  get away with it, perhaps by operating in the black economy. Rather than  reducing the minimum wage, I call for the Government to strengthen the  enforcement of minimum-wage policy and to introduce tougher penalties for  employers who break the rules. There should be a tougher enforcement plan on  the payment of the minimum wage.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  support the motion. I welcome the debate, and I thank the proposer of the  motion for bringing it to the Chamber.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP is opposed to tampering with the national minimum  wage. The introduction of the national minimum wage was one of Labour&rsquo;s most  successful and progressive economic policies. As has been said, from 1 October  2007 the minimum wage will be increased. For adults, it will rise to &pound;5&middot;52 an  hour; for 18 to 21 year olds, it will rise  to &pound;4&middot;45 an hour; and for 16 to 17 year olds to &pound;3&middot;40 an hour. Those  increases will by no means make anyone rich, but they will go a little way  towards meeting the ever-increasing costs of living in Northern Ireland.  If a variable rate of the minimum wage were introduced, it would damage what we  are trying and need to build on. Predictably, it would discourage people from  taking up employment, especially those who are caught in the poverty trap of low-paid jobs. Many people who are caught in that  trap have no incentive to work,  given that they are financially better off on benefits. It is important  to be able to encourage people to take up the challenge of employ&shy;ment. Paid  work can be a vital route out of poverty, but only when workers have access to  secure jobs with decent pay and working conditions. That is particularly the case for women, who fill approximately three  quarters of low-paid jobs. Women who work full time are still paid only  80% of their male colleagues&rsquo; earnings, and part-time female workers earn even  less.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am disturbed by reports that Gordon Brown&rsquo;s Labour  Government may be considering a dual, rather than a national, minimum wage. It  has been reported that the London  rate may be adjusted to be approximately 10% more than the applicable  rate for regions such as Northern    Ireland. It has already been pointed out  that the housing costs in Northern Ireland  are among the highest in the UK.  Costs of light, heating and food in areas such as Northern   Ireland already exceed London costs for the same products. Those  costs exist in spite of the fact that pay rates in Northern Ireland are only about 80%  of the average pay rates in GB.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The national minimum  wage is a floor that recognises the value of doing an honest day&rsquo;s work  for a basic rate of pay. It is not wildly generous, but it gives a measure of statutory recognition to the value and dignity  of work. Although the minimum wage is a reserved matter, the Assembly  must send a strong message of opposition to any  proposal to vary it. A BBC economist, who supported a dual wage, said  that two thirds of income in Northern    Ireland was public-sector generated &mdash; either  from public sector employment or from benefits. However, that is a red herring.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some 35,000 immigrants have come from Poland to work  in Northern Ireland,  often for the national minimum wage. That highlights the fact that a  decent rate of pay that can be supplemented,  if necessary, by family benefits for the low-paid, can reduce the  culture of dependency and provide the best way out of poverty for families. The  SDLP believes in creating a fair, equal society in which the most vulnerable  and marginalised are protected. Those in low-paid jobs, who work hard just to survive, need support and protection. A fully  inclusive society will come about only if people feel that they are  contributing to it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The gap between the rich and the poor &mdash; the haves and the  have-nots &mdash; is increasing. According to the Northern Ireland Anti-Poverty  Network, wages in Northern    Ireland are 25% lower than the EU average.  That is unacceptable, and the Assembly has both a political and moral duty to ensure that low-paid workers receive  a fair deal. Put simply, they deserve a fair day&rsquo;s pay for a fair day&rsquo;s work.  If the Assembly is serious about tackling poverty, a reduction in the minimum  wage would be totally counterproductive.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  support the motion. It is important for the  Assembly to send out a strong and well-argued case, based on a sound  economic rationale, for its opposition to the lowering of the minimum wage in Northern Ireland.  This subject has sparked much discussion among economists. Current  scaremongering may be based on the arguments of some economists that a minimum wage that is artificially higher than the  market rate leads to unemployment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the other hand, just as many economists point out the  strong basis for having a minimum wage. Not only does it benefit individual  workers by guaranteeing them a solid, secure and standard level of living, but  it also creates demand in society, ensures that people have money to reinvest  in the economy and boosts the overall size of the public sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland, it is clear that the minimum wage  is not artificially higher than the market rate and does not, therefore, contribute to unemployment, which is at its  lowest level for almost 40 years. Although that is encouraging and a major  achievement, it masks some problems beneath the surface that must be taken into  account. A variable minimum wage in Northern Ireland would do nothing  to address fundamental problems, such as the number of people who are  economically inactive. Several Members mentioned that point earlier: Northern Ireland has the highest level of economic&shy;ally inactive people in the UK, at over  26% of the working population. That is an extremely high and unsustainable  figure. The next-highest rate in the UK is about 20%. There must be an  awareness of the major subregional variations in Northern   Ireland; for instance, the number of economically  inactive in Derry approaches almost 50%.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Carmel Hanna mentioned the increasing demand for workers  throughout the economy. People come from overseas to take up posts to satisfy  the demand of local companies. Those workers do not take jobs from local people, but satisfy a demand that could not  otherwise be met. The large number of people who are economically  inactive highlights the fact that structural problems in society keep people  out of the workplace &mdash; it is not because the wage structures act as a  deterrent. If anything, lowering the minimum wage will make it much harder to  attract people who are out of the labour market back to work in the near  future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There must be a focus on creating high-value-added jobs in Northern Ireland. In recent years,  there has been too much economic investment in low-value-added and  low-paid jobs. In particular, a comparison of the level and nature of investment in Northern   Ireland to that in the Republic  of Ireland shows that Northern Ireland  is not attracting the same calibre of jobs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a major challenge ahead to ensure that we have a balanced economy that focuses on those  well-paid jobs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a gap of almost 20% between the average public-sector wage and the average private-sector  wage. That situation is unsustainable and, therefore, we must focus on  trying to improve the pay of local people. Although Members may support the  motion, it is important to be sensible about it and think through the  implications of doing so. Notwithstanding yesterday&rsquo;s debate on tax-varying  powers, most parties are contin&shy;uing to support  the call for a separate rate of corporation tax for Northern Ireland.  However, we must have a clear argument as to why we believe there is a case for  varying corporation tax while insisting that the parity principle with respect  to the minimum wage should remain very much in place.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Equally, we should bear in mind that there is a federal  minimum wage in the United    States, but that individual states and  cities can have higher rates. What would happen if London wanted to go for a higher minimum  wage? What would be the response of the Northern Ireland Assembly to that,  especially if the same minimum wage existed across the country? We would want  to ensure that wealth would not be concentrated in south-east England and  would argue that concentrating wealth in one area would be a backward step for  the country. It is something we should bear in mind.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Northern Ireland is an  integral part of the United Kingdom,  and workers in Northern    Ireland are, therefore, entitled to the same  standards, benefits and rights as workers in every other part of the Kingdom.  It is noticeable, and it has been highlighted this afternoon, that politicians  in every other region and nation of the United   Kingdom are opposed to any plan for a variation in the  minimum wage across the United    Kingdom. All parties in the Assembly also  agree on the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some people have argued that the cost-of-living in Northern Ireland is lower than that in other  regions of the United    Kingdom, but the evidence is clear that that  is no longer the case. If one considers the cost of living increases in Northern Ireland  and, particularly, the cost of housing, it is clear that any gap that did exist  is either disappearing rapidly or has disappeared already. We want to get  people out of total dependency on benefits and into work. We believe that it is  good for the person concerned and for their family, for society and for the  economy. We should oppose resolutely any disincentive to getting a job, or any  incentive to remaining dependent on benefits. Therefore I hope that Members  will give their total support to a standard national minimum wage across the United Kingdom.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those on the economic side may argue that lower minimum  wage levels would be attractive to investors, but there is a serious question over  the validity of that argument; there is no strong evidence for it. While it is  important to build up the economy, there are more effective things that could  and should be done rather than tampering with the national minimum wage. The Alliance Party believes that the retention of the  national minimum wage across the United Kingdom will be of benefit  in the way that I have outlined. We welcome the fact that the national minimum  wage is due to increase in October &mdash; albeit only by 17p &mdash; to &pound;5&middot;52, and that everyone in the country will be entitled  to that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. There is an  impressive consistency in the remarks. I, too, support the motion and thank Mr  McClarty and Mr McCrea for presenting us with the opportunity to debate the issue. I hope that the Assembly will take the opportunity to express its outright  rejection of the case that was  produced on behalf of the Economic Research Council.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It seems that Gordon Brown was impressed by that report,  which recommended that workers in northern regions should be paid a less  generous wage than those in the south-east and that the unemployed in northern  regions should receive less generous benefits. It seems that the one-size-fits-all policy, with which the  Executive have already been  confronted when seeking the necessary tools and flexibility to deliver  on the Programme for Government, is not immutable. What does that say about  convergence and parity?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been a great deal of discussion about the regional  variation of the minimum wage. We could all endorse many of the points that  have been made that discussion, but there is little benefit in repeating them. That said, I support the comments that several Members  have made. It is important to note that regional  variation is a blatant attempt to drive down salary and wage levels  across the board. This region already has some experience of that strategy, and  it has already been marketed for many years &mdash; for too many, in fact &mdash; as a  low-wage economy. Although the use of that strategy has declined, it has not  been completely abandoned. Such a marketing  strategy not only depresses the wages and salaries of workers, it  sustains a lower-skills base and makes it extremely difficult to attract the  wealth-creating, knowledge-based investments that are needed to regenerate our  economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The regeneration of the economy is an important common  ground for the political parties, given that they are divided on and need to  resolve many other issues. That is work in progress. However, a common front is  needed to formulate the regeneration of the economy and to provide a sound  basis for sustaining the political process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to assume  the responsibility of speaking for other parties, but a consensus has  been stated repeatedly. That position has been publicly recorded many times,  not least in the reports of the subgroup of the Committee on the Preparation  for Government. All of the parties argued that we should be attracting the  higher-value-added wealth-creating enterprises that are currently investing in the South of Ireland and elsewhere.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister  to the Chamber. I had intended to exhort him to make a clear statement  that took cognisance of the correspondence that my colleague Sue Ramsey  mentioned. However, that is all that I will say on that matter. No party in the  Assembly could endorse a reduction of the minimum wage. We already have an  underdeveloped economy, and on many occasions we have rehearsed why we need to  invest in higher performance; why we seek to  promote enterprise; why we need to encourage entrepreneurs; why we need  to motivate our workforce; and why we need to invest in education and skills  programmes. Let us move on with that more progressive agenda. We must eradicate  the long-standing patterns of regional inequality. That is a challenge in  itself. It will not be done by colluding with or countenancing any argument  that advocates reducing the minimum wage. Growing the economy and the private  sector &mdash; and creating wealth &mdash; are the means by which we will create  prosperity. The introd&shy;uction of measures such as a regional variation on minimum wages or unemployment benefits will sabotage  that objective.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  First, I congratulate the Members who secured the debate. I am sure that many  of us were surprised when we heard that the Prime Minister was giving serious  consideration to reducing the minimum wage  in Northern Ireland  and to implementing a variable regional minimum wage. As is always the  case for Members speaking at this late stage of a debate, many of the points that I wish to raise have already  been made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We were well used to Mr Brown, during his time as  Chancellor of the Exchequer, giving with one hand and taking with the other,  and now it seems that, as Prime Minister, he is intent on taking from those in  low-paid jobs in Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People who live in London  have a higher cost of living than those in some other regions of the United Kingdom, and that is recognised in some  part, for example, by the supplement to loans for students studying in London. However, I do not  welcome a regionalisation of the minimum wage, because the result will be a  lowering of the minimum wage not only in Northern   Ireland, but in Scotland,  Wales and the north-east of England.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">New Labour boasted of the 1&middot;5 million people who would benefit from their increased minimum wage,  and, over the past decade, many of those who work in the lowest-paid jobs have at least been given some protection  with regard to how much they earn. Adults working in low-paid jobs are also  protected against losing their jobs to those who are willing to work for lower  wages. If the current Labour Administration  were to reduce the minimum wage in  Northern Ireland to &pound;4&middot;80 &mdash; as reports have suggested &mdash; many families  who survive on low wages and live from day to day on the breadline would be plunged into financial crisis. The proposed  reduction can be viewed as nothing but a backward step, and it will, undoubtedly, create fear among those who already  find it tough to make ends meet.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are already too many families and children in Northern Ireland  living in poverty. Low pay is widely recognised as a major factor contributing  to household poverty. Furthermore, a lower minimum wage in Northern Ireland will be tantamount to labelling  Northern Ireland  as a low-wage economy that provides low-skilled and low-paid jobs. That will do  nothing to encourage more people into work, and labelling Northern Ireland as  something different will not help us in attracting foreign investment for  high-skilled and well-paid jobs in the knowledge economy towards which we  aspire.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members have spoken of the importance of getting  people into employment. The high levels of economic inactivity among adults in Northern Ireland,  and the contentment of many to live off welfare, have been mentioned. Work  should be viewed as a means to earn more money and to better oneself. An  individual should benefit from coming off welfare and into work. Do Members  think that people will be encouraged to come  off benefits and into employment if the minimum wage in Ulster is  slashed?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said previously, the fact is that a regional minimum  wage for workers in Northern Ireland the minimum wage here would drop to &pound;4&middot;80.  Are the Government saying that someone in Northern   Ireland who is doing exactly the same job as someone in London has a job of less  value? We should not compensate for higher costs of living in London by  reducing the minimum wage elsewhere, and, based on reports that have surfaced,  Northern Ireland is towards the bottom of that scale &mdash; despite the recent rise  in the cost of living, as other Members have mentioned. Considering the steep rise in property prices in Northern    Ireland over the last months, it could well be argued that the statistics used to  formulate the variable rates of minimum wage are obsolete. The cost of living  in Northern Ireland has never been higher, and there could  not be a worse time to consider reducing the minimum wage. Those who would suffer already live on low wages and have a  poorer standard of living than everywhere else. I hope that the Prime Minister  is not seriously considering the proposal. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  There is no point in describing regional variance as anything other than a pay  cut for those on the minimum wage. I have recently criticised the threat to  reduce the minimum wage in Northern    Ireland, and I will continue to do so.  According to the Government&rsquo;s figures, the household income in Northern Ireland  is well below the regional average. That is a disgrace, and even to suggest  reducing the minimum wage &mdash; not to mention it being the subject of a prime  ministerial proposal &mdash; is an insult.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are British citizens and should be treated equally to  other British citizens. Northern Ireland  should not be seen as an area in which the minimum wage can be reduced to pay  for the raising of the minimum wage in London.  The Westminster  Government talk about reducing child poverty, making it worthwhile to work, and  all citizens being equal. However, reading such a proposal makes one wonder if  the Government are serious about any of those intentions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP and, I believe, the Assembly, find the proposed  attack on the lowest paid in society reprehen&shy;sible. Anyone working for the  minimum wage does not have spare income to spend. Most of their money &mdash; if not  all &mdash; is spent on keeping a roof over their heads, paying the bills and,  perhaps, trying to get children through university.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All this must be looked  at while remembering that the cost of living in Northern Ireland is, in some respects, greater  than that in the rest of the United    Kingdom: much of our clothing, food and many  other products have to be imported. That, of course, adds to the price of every  single item we buy and reduces the amount of cash  available, for example for any recreational activity by a family.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With all that in mind, I argue that the rates for the minimum wage in Northern Ireland should be raised,  not lowered. Further, it must be  remembered that the Govern&shy;ment have  insisted that they will not reduce corporation tax to aid business. Is  Mr Brown trying to offset that refusal by reducing the wages of workers  instead?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Varney Report hits the nail on the head when it  mentions the bias towards London and the  south-east of England.  It looks as if Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  pleas for assistance to rebuild an economy deprived by years of underinvestment  will fall on the same deaf ears as they have always done in Downing   Street. Now we have an added  insult with Northern Ireland  seen as an area where wages can be cut with the Westminster Government&rsquo;s  approval.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My constituents are worth a lot more than the minimum wage  at its present level, and in no circum&shy;stances will I support any move that  will take money directly out of workers&rsquo; wage packets.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am happy to support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I read Mr Hennessy&rsquo;s article in &lsquo;The Sunday Telegraph&rsquo; on  23 July that said that the Prime Minister was drawing up plans to vary the  minimum wage, region by region, across the UK.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The background to the story is that senior Labour sources  believe that a regional minimum wage is a logical step, given the Prime  Minister&rsquo;s announcement four years ago when, as Chancellor, he stated that  regional price indices would be published to show variations in inflation rates  across the country. A report for the Economic Research Council by Professor  David Smith from the University   of Derby said that the  minimum wage for Londoners should be boosted to &pound;6.90 an hour. It also said  that the level in the north-east should be  cut by 57p to &pound;4.78, while the workers in Yorkshire  should get a minimum of &pound;4.95. Employees in Northern   Ireland should be paid at least &pound;4.80 an hour, and those in Wales no more than &pound;4.84. The report  called for Britain to adopt  a similar system to those operating in Switzerland  and America,  where local authorities are allowed to set benefits, the minimum wage and the  salaries of public-sector workers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That smacks of gross hypocrisy on the part of New Labour.  The minimum wage was introduced as one of its flagship policies. In 2005 when  Tony Blair raised the minimum wage he declared:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;This will benefit  1&middot;4 million people&hellip; and it is a powerful symbol of how this country is changing  for the good.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">Now his successor, Gordon Brown, is  seeking to undo that by penalising those on low wages outside London.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The minimum wage is a powerful way of making sure that work  pays and it sends out the message that society supports those who take the  decision to work. The Prime Minister&rsquo;s plans to reduce the minimum wage will  hit hard-working individuals and families throughout the regions of the United Kingdom.  We cannot allow him to do that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We all know that Northern   Ireland, like some other UK regions, has unacceptably high  levels of economic inactivity. In other words, we need to get people into work. Just how are we meant to do that when the  Prime Minister is planning to ensure that work does not pay? Getting people off welfare benefits and into employment  is good for them, good for their communities and good for the economy. It  beggars belief that Gordon Brown should be penalising work, which will have the  opposite effect.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 26 July this year I wrote to the Prime Minister to relay  my concern over that ill-thought out idea. My office received the following  reply from the Prime Minister dated 8 August 2007, and it shows how the Prime  Minister is attempting to evade this issue.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The letter reads:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I am writing on behalf of the Prime Minister to thank  you for your letter dated 26<sup>th</sup> July 2007.</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">The Prime Minister has asked me to arrange for a  Minister in the Northern    Ireland Office to reply to you direct.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To date, I have yet to receive a reply, let alone an  acknowledgement, from the NIO, and that is an absolute disgrace.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am left to conclude  that the Government are working to  compose a cover story, no doubt with a smokescreen. It is a coincidence  that yesterday my office received a response from Pat McFadden MP, the Minister  of State for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs, in the Department for  Business, Enterprise  and Regulatory Reform stating:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There are no variations to the minimum wage rate  between areas and no plans to set different rates.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What is going on? The Prime Minister may have been trying  to pull a fast one but was caught on.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am in contact with my party leader, who is also the  Minister for Employment and Learning, and he has been more than helpful in  ensuring that the minimum wage is not interfered with.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to leave Members with this sobering thought: if we  take the average working week to be 40 hours, the plans proposed by the Prime  Minister would mean that families that rely on the minimum wage the most would  have &pound;22 less a week in their pockets, which is &pound;88 a month &mdash; almost &pound;90 &mdash; and  we cannot simply sit back and let that happen.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: I am grateful to my two colleges  for introducing the motion. Several Members said that the announcement from academic researchers that appeared  in the press took them by surprise. Everyone has been quick to say that the  research was merely carried out by an academic and that it does not have any  standing. However, we are all long enough in the tooth to know that the oldest  trick in the book is to fly the kite; in policy terms, that is not done  directly, it is kept one stage removed, you let someone else do it, and you see  what happens.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will attempt to respond to some of the individual  comments, which have been welcome. It has already been stated that the national  minimum wage is a reserved matter, and that the Executive does not have direct  influence or authority over it. Nevertheless, pursuing  such a policy would have major consequences for the Executive. In common  with most Members, I am opposed to any move to replace the national minimum  wage with variations. I made that clear to Ms Ramsey, the Member for West Belfast, who is the Chairperson of the Committee for  Employment and Learning, when she wrote to me during the summer. As average  wages in Northern Ireland  are among the lowest in the UK, regional  variations would undoubtedly lead to the lower minimum wage that some  Members quoted as being part of the research.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Professor Smith&rsquo;s article claimed that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s cost of living was 7% below  the UK  average. However, that estimate was for 2004, and anybody who knows anything about the cost of living in Northern    Ireland today will know that that information is wholly out of date.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the mid 1820s, the  cotton weavers of Ballymacarrett, in the heart of what is now my  constituency, worked from 4 o&rsquo;clock in the morning until late at night, seven  days a week, and received the princely sum of four shillings and six pence.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To put the current minimum wage into context: if we, as  Assembly Members, were paid the minimum wage &mdash; and I see a look of terror on  the faces of Members &mdash; instead of receiving nearly &pound;900 a week, we would get  about &pound;200 a week. That would make little difference to those Members who are  of indepen&shy;dent means, but we all know that many households are just surviving by a narrow margin. That is the  difference between what Members are paid and the national minimum wage.  Therefore, any cut to the modest level of the minimum wage would create a real  injustice for people. Members must also carefully consider the implications of water rates and so on, which will  clearly have an impact on household budgets, as we move into what will  be a difficult period in the autumn.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The most dangerous and pernicious part of the proposal to  lower the minimum wage &mdash; and many contributors have made this point &mdash; is that  it might signify the thin end of the wedge  on the issue of benefits. Currently, the benefits budget is met  nationally through annually managed  expenditure. I fear that if the principle were established that people  on the minimum wage should be paid less, benefits could fall.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members are trying to encourage people into work, and my  Department is running several initiatives with that aim. If the basic minimum  wage were lowered, particularly in the  context of the large numbers of migrant workers, which we did not have  in Northern Ireland  five years ago, then the Department for Employment and Learning would find it  exceptionally difficult to get people back to work. That is self-evident.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sadly, there has been no  significant progress in closing the earnings gap between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. I  understand the argument, which Mr Ross and others have made, that there are  specific issues in London.  There has always been a London  weighting for teachers and other professionals. However, I have great difficulty with the moves across the water  to have variations between different regions &mdash; even different counties.  Dr Farry made the point that there are major variations within Northern Ireland.  Areas such as Strabane have had a history  of high unemployment, and I cannot understand how a reduction in the  minimum wage would advance things at all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When I asked officials to make enquiries, it was made clear, as George Savage said, that the Department  for Business, Enterprise  and Regulatory Reform has indicated that  there are no plans to reduce the minimum wage. I have no doubt that, if  the Prime Minister is contemplating an election, this issue is certainly not  one that he will want to wave a flag about in advance. However, Members must be  vigilant on this issue, and I welcome the fact that the Committee for  Employment and Learning will discuss the matter tomorrow.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I take note of the remarks of my colleague, David McClarty, who said that lower wage costs would  actually bring more people into the benefits trap than would be taken out, and Sue Ramsey quoted people from Scotland  and Wales. While I do believe that the idea is probably off the table at this  time, that does not mean to say that, perhaps after an election or at some  future stage, it could not come back onto  the table. In Northern Ireland, we are particularly vulnerable to that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Next week the Assembly will be discussing fuel poverty. All Members know that the cost of  utilities such as gas and  electricity, both for businesses and households, is significantly higher  than elsewhere in the UK.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Added to that mix is the cost of housing, because housing  benefit only goes so far towards the amount that landlords charge, and people  have to dig into their own resources to pay for accommodation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The housing argument is over. Housing costs are higher in Northern Ireland than in most regions of the UK, with the exception of London and the south-east. Fuel and food  costs are also higher. The argument that we have a lower cost of living is well  off the mark and out of date.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to Robin  Newton&rsquo;s point about apprentice&shy;ships, yes, there are some exemptions.  It may be that apprentices who are just starting out may not have the  experience and training to add as much value. I will look into that and write  to the Member to clarify the position, because I am not 100% clear about it  myself.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Carmel Hanna &mdash; a former Minister in this Depart&shy;ment &mdash; raised the point that women are far more  likely to be in receipt of the national minimum wage than are men. As many women work part time, that is inevitable.  We are still trying to improve the level of female involvement in the economy, and reducing the minimum wage would  be a huge disincentive to women. It just goes to show that the range of issues  that affect people grows once a policy such as this is rolled out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry mentioned the issue of public- versus private-sector wages. There is undoubtedly a  difference. I am not sure of the  precise amount, but I will look into it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nelson McCausland made a point about which we must be  careful. He said that workers in Northern Ireland  are entitled to the same standards as in other parts of the UK. I  understand that argument. However, all our parties are seeking variations in  the tax regime within the UK.  We must be careful that that argument does not get turned on its head. We must  make the point that, on its own merits, lowering the minimum wage is a bad  decision in principle. That argument can stand alone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">George Robinson made a valid point about child poverty &mdash;  one other Member also raised it. The UK Government&rsquo;s  targets for the eradication of child poverty are currently not being  met. I cannot think of anything that would prolong child poverty more than not  giving people the opportunity to climb out of very-low-paid jobs or get off  benefits.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If we are trying to give people an incentive to get off  benefits and into work, lowering the minimum wage makes no sense whatsoever. I  could understand it, from an economic point of view, if there were a large  variation between the national minimum wage and the market value of labour.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Immigration is another cause for concern, as Carmel Hanna mentioned. Last week I spoke to my counterpart  in Dublin,  and people are worried there. There has been an enormous surge of  immigration. Many immigrants are skilled workers, such as welders or surveyors,  but many others are receiving the minimum wage. If that was to be lowered, it  would be likely that part of the indigenous population would be pushed back  onto benefits. However, because migrant workers are not immediately eligible  for benefits, they would take minimum wage-jobs because the wages would still  be relatively high compared to those in  their home countries. The net effect would be that in areas where low  wages are paid the indigenous population would be driven back onto benefits,  which could create tensions in the community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is something that we should try to avoid. I am  discussing that, not only with colleagues in Dublin  but also with my counterparts in Scotland, because if we do not  manage that properly, it could return to haunt us. Nothing would exacerbate  that situation so much as reducing the national minimum wage.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank all the Members who contributed to this useful  debate. We may be reassured by the letters received by George Savage and by the  information that my Department has received. However, I urge the Committee for  Employment and Learning and all Members to be vigilant, because the issue may  return in the future. The Committee should  consider making its views known to its counterparts in Scotland and Wales. I will do the same, so that  the idea is not allowed to gather momentum, either at present or in the future.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am grateful to those Members remaining in the Chamber. When Members are in  such agreement, it can be difficult to get a debate going. To raise Members&rsquo;  spirits, I shall take the opportunity to pose a few challenges. I have listened  with interest to points made by several Members.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I begin, therefore, with a few questions. If Northern Ireland  has the highest level of economically inactive people and a below-average  working wage, why has it only average  levels of poverty? I heard several Members speak yesterday about the  need to tackle poverty, yet Northern Ireland sits in the middle of the poverty league table. One of the reasons why we have a minimum wage  is precisely to tackle poverty, but we do not necessarily have that problem.  Why do we have a minimum wage? I have heard  a lot of talk about the implications one way or the other, but what was  the reason for introducing a minimum wage in the first place? If we understand  that, then we have to take on board certain implications of decisions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am about to quote Ms Ramsey. Let me do that, and then I will give way. The  question that Ms Ramsey and Mr George Robinson posed is this: if the minimum  wage is such a good thing, why not raise it?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will give way now. Ms Ramsey can make her point.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I have two points. First, I have a problem with the issue of the minimum wage.  We have to be looking at a living wage, since some people are working merely to  survive. My second point is that I am confused by Mr McCrea&rsquo;s assertion that he  wants to add life to the debate. When he was asking those questions, I was  concerned as to whether he was actually supporting the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Obviously, if I put my name to a motion and propose it, my Minister comes  forward and we are all in agreement, of course I am going to support it.  However, there are some issues that we have not tackled because we have gone  round and said things, and they are likely to be raised in other forums. The real reason why the minimum wage was introduced  was to promote fairness in society. Some people perform very valuable jobs that  do not require great skills or any formal qualifications: cleaners, security  men &mdash; a whole range of other workers who have no economic strength. The minimum wage was introduced to protect  those vulnerable workers. That is the key point, and that fairness is why the  minimum wage should not be reduced.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The second reason for the introduction of the national  minimum wage was to get people out of the benefits  trap and back to work. At the moment, Northern Ireland has the lowest unemployment rate that it has had  for decades: 3&middot;6%. When one talks about taking people out of the benefits trap,  one should look at the figures involved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We do not have more students at work or more elderly people. The reason for the increase in  economic&shy;a<span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">ll</span>y inactive people is that they are either sick or  disabled. It is a matter of whether  the genuinely sick and disabled are to be forced back into work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Society must examine that issue and concede that, given 30  to 40 years of the Troubles, it is reasonable to expect that the population of Northern Ireland  is suffering greater mental distress. Those circumstances underlie the high figures for disability living  allowance. Therefore, the labour pool that some Members say will be  encouraged back to work is simply not there.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members have suggested that benefits could be tinkered  with and pushed back up. However, a delicate balance must be reached between  incapacity benefit, disability living allowance and other issues. Skills  standards should be raised, but many valuable jobs do not require five GCSEs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Carmel Hanna spoke about the general effects, and I agree that that is one benefit: a rising tide  lifts all boats. I have written a  half-page on Stephen Farry&rsquo;s comments, but I will not go through them  all. However, in relation to the type of job that we want to create, the  highest gross value added, averaging &pound;49,000 an employee, is in the  manufacturing sector; that figure falls to &pound;12,000 in the tourism industry.  Well-paid jobs that give people a working life are being replaced with  part-time jobs in an insecure environment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In light of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s special circumstances, I am  sympathetic to achieving the best financial deal possible, but there is a  danger in cherry-picking economic issues &mdash; for example, supporting a lower rate  of corporation tax, rejecting the lowering of the minimum wage and expecting  benefits to remain the same, and so forth. Everything forms part of a  complicated system of networks, and Members must be careful that their  arguments stand in their own right.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are two key points in the argument on the minimum  wage. It is fair: society should protect those who do a hard day&rsquo;s work in  environments that are not always enticing. Those people do a good job, and  Members should strive to look after them. However, the correct incentives must  be in place for those people to progress. In particular, that issue will affect  the emerging group of young people who should be encouraged into work in spite  of the legacy of the past 30 to 40 years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have sympathy with Alastair Ross, who mentioned the  difficulties of a winding-up speech, because it is not easy to cover every  issue. However, Members should be careful when they characterise some people as  being content to live off the welfare state. Are people really content to live  off the welfare state? People do that when  they have neither the opportunities nor the skills to exploit those  opportunities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The question was asked: what do Members want to deliver for  all the people of Northern    Ireland? The answer is: an economy that  recognises and fully recompenses skills.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, with regard to fuel poverty and housing benefit, the answer to the question that I posed  earlier is if housing costs were to be taken out of the calculation, only then would Northern Ireland have an approximately  average level of poverty. I accept what the Minister has said about recent  changes in housing costs. If housing costs were not taken out altogether, Northern Ireland  would zoom to the top of the league of poverty and related problems. That must  be taken on board.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Lest there be any doubt; the reason that David McClarty and  I have moved the motion is that despite the national minimum wage&rsquo;s being a  reserved matter, it permeates every other aspect of a fair and equitable  society &mdash; one that tries to eradicate not only child poverty, but all poverty.  We want to encourage people. I commend the Minister and the Chairperson of the  Committee for Employment and Learning for the approach  that they have taken on the matter. I hope that the Assembly will not  only tackle the issue, but will examine its  root causes. I, therefore, support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly opposes  any attempt to replace the national minimum wage with regional variants.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion made:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Assembly do now  adjourn. <em>&mdash; [Mr Deputy Speaker]</em></p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="5"></a>Adjournment</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">New Visitors&rsquo; Centre at &nbsp;the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: A  new visitors&rsquo; centre at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway is perhaps an unusual subject for an Adjourn&shy;ment debate. However, all will agree that it is a  significant one because of the necessity of such a centre at the Giant&rsquo;s  Causeway, which is of crucial importance to the tourism industry here and on  the island of Ireland. No other natural feature on the  island of Ireland enjoys such a level of  international recognition. Everyone believes  that it is essential to have a world-class facility at the site.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The delay in producing that simply defined result has come  to be seen as a metaphor for the sclerotic bureaucracy and the inadequate and  non-delivering governmental process that we have enjoyed. Recently, I have seen  considerable references to that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a result of two departmental press releases yesterday, the scenario for the debate is  different to that which I had expected when I requested it. One came  from the Minister of the Environment, which said that she was &ldquo;of a mind to  approve&rdquo; a planning application in support of a private-sector proposal for a  visitors&rsquo; centre. Although she is minded, however, she is not in a position to  make a decision until she and her officials have had further discussions. A  linked statement came from the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, who said that he would withdraw funding for the  public-sector proposal that his Department has led for several years on  account of the statement that had come from the Environment Minister. Not many  Members would regard the timing of those statements to be coincidental in the  light of the fact that the Adjournment debate on the subject was to take place  today. Movement seems to have been rapid. I have no doubt that the Minister of  the Environment would have preferred to make a final announcement on planning  approval and would not have been keen to merely be in a position whereby she is  only minded to take a particular course of action.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make an important point about the manner in which the information was released; it was in  the form of press statements and not in ministerial statements to the  Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Deputy Speaker might like to bring that to the attention of the Speaker; he may wish to consider  whether House privilege was breached by making statements of import in  such a way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will make two points. I have no objections, in principle,  to private sector solutions to public need; that  is a general comment rather than one relating to the issue under  discussion. Nor do I have any objection, in principle, to a Government or  Department saying that it has changed its mind on an issue. There are bound to  be times when that is a perfectly good and sensible thing to do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, there are major issues around the decision on the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway visitors&rsquo; centre, two of which are  crucial. The first is the integrity of our government process; the second remains the achievement of a visitors&rsquo; centre. I have spent a significant amount of time  talking about the integrity of the government process, which is an issue  that Members should take seriously. How the government process applies to the  decision on the Giant&rsquo;s   Causeway visitors&rsquo;  centre is something to which we should devote a great deal of attention.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Four questions arise from the issue of integrity. The first  is for the Minister of the Environment. She needs to reassure me, the Assembly  and the public that the decision that she  will, undoubtedly, make &mdash; conferring planning approval on the private  sector application &mdash; was taken strictly on planning grounds. If necessary, I  will submit a question under freedom of information legislation and ask that  the advice that the Minister received from  the Planning Service, and the discussions that her Department had on the  issue, be revealed. I do not know whether that information is obtainable under  freedom of information legislation, but I can find out. The Minister can  prevent me from having to force the issue by  making her decision-making process transparent, and that would give the  necessary reassurance to the public. I am asking that she do that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The other three questions are for DETI. Why did it change  its mind? Contrary to its press statement, DETI was leading the project. Even  after the release of the ministerial statement, DETI&rsquo;s website still asserted  that the Department was leading the project. Its website probably still makes that claim. For years, DETI  has been in no doubt that it, along  with several other public-sector players, was leading a public-sector  project.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A Department is  entitled to change its mind. However, if there has been considerable  expenditure of public money &mdash; and if the  change has important consequences &mdash; a Department has a duty to explain  itself. DETI led the project because there was a belief that a visitors&rsquo; centre  would be better delivered as a public-sector project. DETI must explain why it  now thinks that it is not better delivered as a public-sector project.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not agree with the reference in the statement to  disagreement among the parties in the Assembly. I have talked to key parties  involved in the project, and there seems to have been, for a considerable  period, a lack of communication between DETI  and those parties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My next question for DETI is this: why announce the  dropping of public funding for the public-sector proposal simply on account of  planning approval for the private-sector project? Let us just assume that  planning approval for the project has been granted, although that has not been  finalised. We all know that getting planning approval for a project is no  guarantee that the project will go ahead. Therefore, for DETI to say that it is  now washing its hands of the public-sector project simply because planning  approval has been given for the  private-sector project raises a great question mark about the matter &mdash; unless, of course, the Minister knows  more about the certainty of the private-sector project than anyone has yet  said. If, indeed, he does know more, he is  under a duty to tell the public about it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My final question is this: can the Minister confirm that no  public money will be provided to support the private-sector project? If, in a  month or a year&rsquo;s time, public money were to  be given in support of the project, other potential contractors could  rightly say: &ldquo;Excuse me, was I not entitled  to express an interest in delivering that project too?&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those four questions must be clearly answered so that the  Assembly can have confidence in the integrity of the governmental process. That  is important at any time, but it is particularly important in this fledgling  Assembly. I hope that my questions will be given consideration and that they  will be answered with an openness that can give us some reassurance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the question  of whether we have a mechanism to deliver a visitors&rsquo; centre. Everyone  should be very clear that no such mechanism is guaranteed. All we have is  planning approval &mdash; nearly &mdash; for a private-sector project. On the basis of that  alone, DETI has essentially said that it is putting no more public money into  this and that it is washing its hands of the public-sector project. The  Assembly should not accept that as satisfactory. DETI has accepted the lead  over the years to ensure that there is a visitors&rsquo; centre at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway. That responsibility remains with DETI.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not privy to the business case for the visitors centre, but the application of even a little  common sense suggests that there could be snags. We are told that one of  the concerns for the Minister and DETI was that the public-sector project would  cost over &pound;21 million. It is a very sophisticated project and so too is the  private-sector developer&rsquo;s project. I have not seen a costing for it, but it  will be a considerable sum. The private-sector developer will develop only if  he believes that he can make a return on his money. Where will the income come  from? The obvious sources are car parking and the sale of cups of tea and the  like. Many cars would have to be parked and many cups of tea sold to get a  return on a project of that nature, particularly when there is no monopoly on  those services &mdash; a car park already exists there, and more than one party sells  cups of tea. There is, therefore, no  guarantee that this private-sector project will go ahead at all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It will not be in  anyone&rsquo;s interest if we again reach the situation whereby this business  runs with uncertainty for years. People will simply laugh at the Assembly, the  Executive and the governmental process and say: &ldquo;Come off it, you cannot even  deliver a visitors&rsquo; centre at the biggest  tourist attraction in the North of Ireland &mdash;&rdquo; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I think that I heard a Member from the opposite Benches say  that that is exactly what could happen. That is what has happened and what  still could happen.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The responsibility remains with DETI, and I will be pleased  to hear the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment say that he still  accepts that responsibility.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are the essential points. Questions remain on the  integrity of the process, and we need reassurances that there will still be a  visitors&rsquo; centre at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>: This matter is fraught with difficulty. The proposed visitors&rsquo;  centre is in north Antrim, but, as several people have said today on the  airwaves, it is more than just a local centre. The centre would be based in  north Antrim, but would cater for more than 500,000  visitors a year, and, as such, would be Northern Ireland&rsquo;s premier visitors&rsquo; resource. Therefore, it is a  Northern Ireland-wide facility. Unfortunately, because of the controversy that  has emerged &mdash; whether or not that is contrived &mdash; some people appear to have  missed what has been happening for the past seven years, or, to be more  accurate, what has not been happening. That is precisely the problem faced by  the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Previously, as the Member for North Antrim Mr O&rsquo;Loan said,  DETI was pioneering the project. For a variety of reasons to which I am not  privy, but have observed from a short  distance as a representative of an area close by, there was no end  product. There is still no end product. If there had not been an announcement yesterday, there would have been no delivery on  an end product today, next month, or  even next year. In response to that seven-year vacuum, in which, for  what&shy;ever reason, there was no end product &mdash; the world-class facility that we  all wanted to see &mdash; an announce&shy;ment had to be made and a decision had to be  taken.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is an unfortunate  fact that there is only one private-sector proposal for the site. That is the reality.  My view, and that of those members of the wider community to whom I have  spoken, is that we want to see a facility that meets the very high levels of  expectation that are the mark of a world heritage site. People are not as  concerned about the delivery mechanism, or who does the delivering, as they are  about the delivery itself.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Having said that, planning applications submitted by the  developer in question have caused difficulties for many people in the past.  Many of them have been in my constituency, and I have represented constituents  in opposition to some of those applications. However, this planning application  is completely separate and different to any of those. I have never come across  any planning application, either from this  applicant or anyone else, of this nature. There are no similarities in  that respect. Given that background and  that context, however, this entire process, from today, must be  subjected to the closest possible scrutiny. If it were not, I would totally and unequivocally oppose it without  reservation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The planning application  must face the most rigorous examination  possible in order to arrive at the conclusion that we all want. The  Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the Minister of the  Environment were placed in an invidious position. What if the seven years of  inability to deliver became eight, nine or 10 years? If that happened, the  Ministers would receive criticism from inside and outside the Chamber for  inactivity. People would ask why the Ministers did not do something.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Does Mr Campbell accept that DETI&rsquo;s position on the Giants&rsquo; Causeway visitors&rsquo;  centre is remote from saying that there was no progress? In October 2005, it  was announced that an international design competition was to take place. Since  then, a planning application has been worked on. DETI said, and probably still  says on its website, that a planning application would be made later in 2007  and that a proposal would be complete by 2010. I am surprised that as a member  of the Minister&rsquo;s party, Mr Campbell says that nothing is happening, given that  DETI has made a commitment to deliver the project and has said publicly how it  is proceeding to do that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I was reluctant to give way given that the Member had previously spoken;  however, I will deal with the matter. I did not say that no progress has been  made; I said that there has not been delivery. It is patently obvious that for  seven years, for a variety of reasons, there has not been delivery on the  world-class facility that everyone wants.  Does the hon Member wish those seven years to become eight, nine, ten or  12 years? I presume that the Ministers are acting in the best interests of  delivering that facility and that they hope to do so. The Member referred to  the website, but the previous, direct rule Minister was responsible for the  facility and was pursuing a particular line until 8 May 2007, when there was a  change of Minister. I am sure that he will respond to the debate in due course.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Hopefully, we are all agreed on the need to deliver the  facility. Provided that the local community and the wider population are  content that the delivery of that facility has been done in the most  appropriate manner, going through all the rigorous examinations that are  necessary, I do not see a problem. That ought to be the conclusion, and I hope that nothing is said in the debate that  would deviate or divert attention from the delivery of a world-class facility.  Moreover, nothing should happen that might jeopardise the world heritage status  of the site, including any surrounding paraphernalia that may accompany any  development application. That is why rigour must be applied to ensure that  every single thing that needs to be done is done to deliver that facility. The  mechanism by which that conclusion is arrived at is of secondary importance.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat. I thank the SDLP Member  for North Antrim for bringing this issue forward  for debate. I thank the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the  Minister of the Environment for their attendance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Giant&rsquo;s Causeway  was declared a world heritage site by UNESCO in 1986, and it is, in my  opinion, Ireland&rsquo;s  greatest tourist asset. The existing visitors&rsquo; centre caters for the 500,000  tourists who visit the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway each  year, and it is important that any visitors&rsquo; centre that is placed there is of  world-class value.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much time, money and effort have gone into the plans for a new visitors&rsquo; centre. The project was  overseen by DETI and the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway Visitor Facilities Ltd, and  DETI was close to submitting plans to the Planning Service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier this week, the Minister seemed to imply that other  bodies had dragged their heels. However, DETI itself had taken on the mantle of  project co-ordination. Other bodies, such as Moyle District Council and the  National Trust, were waiting for the Department to move the project forward, to  get its act together and to submit an application to the Planning Service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the number of tourists who visit the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway each year, the new company would have  made a significant profit. Of that profit, 25% of the surplus would have gone  to Moyle District Council, 25% to the National Trust and 50% would have been  left to the company&rsquo;s discretion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to elaborate on the benefits of those  revenue streams. For example, the money that Moyle District Council generates  from the existing visitor facilities is used to maintain other amenities and  tourist facilities in the area. The money from the existing visitors&rsquo; centre  benefits people from places such as Bushmills, Cushendall, Ballycastle, Armoy,  Ballintoy and even Rathlin   Island. If a private  visitors&rsquo; centre is given the green light, and Moyle District Council loses  that revenue stream, which is currently more than &pound;250,000 a year, the rates in  those areas will shoot through the roof. Moreover, I am sure that the potential  loss of jobs in Moyle District Council and the National Trust has not been  taken into consideration.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Both DUP Ministers pulled the plug on the publicly funded  visitors&rsquo; centre before the Assembly had an opportunity to debate the issue  today. That was clearly an effort to make the debate redundant in the wake of  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s having raised concerns about the matter last Friday. It is  suspicious that no DUP MLA has clarified the  nature of the relationship between the party and the private developer  involved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been revealed that the owner of Seaport Investments  Ltd, Mr Sweeney, signed the nomination papers  for a Moyle DUP councillor in 2005. Mr Sweeney has today admitted that  he is a member of the party. When questioned about that relationship earlier  today, why did the DUP representatives not declare that Mr Sweeney is a member  of their party? If everything was above board, why did the DUP consider it  necessary to hide that detail?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>:  No, I will not give way on this occasion. I have started, so I will finish. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to place on record my concern about the conflict of  interest: two DUP Ministers are involved in potentially  awarding the contract to build a multimillion pound visitor centre to  Seymour Sweeney, a senior DUP member and benefactor.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Assembly want  to hand over the multimillion-pound benefits of Ireland&rsquo;s world heritage  site to a private developer and deprive the people of Moyle of a vital strand  of revenue? Sinn F&eacute;in will back what is good  for the local tourist industry, the local environment and the people of  Moyle. My party remains supportive of the  publicly funded proposal for a new visitors&rsquo; centre and asks the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to  reinstate his support for that project, given recent developments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the approach of the two Ministers, and the DUP in  general, to the subject, it will take much more than statements to address Sinn  F&eacute;in&rsquo;s concerns. The facts about how and why those decisions were taken must be  made known. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I am pleased that there is an opportunity to discuss the new visitors&rsquo; centre. I am well  acquainted with the scheme. In 2001, Moyle District Council invited the  then Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment to discuss the delays in creating the centre. As it turned  out, I drew the short straw and, during the summer of 2001, chaired a series of  meetings between Seymour Sweeney and the National Trust, the two organisations  that had submitted proposals for the redevelopment of the visitors&rsquo; centre.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, nothing came of those discussions. Bearing  in mind, as other Members have said, that the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway is Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  most important attraction, I admit that I am disappointed that the Assembly is  still dealing with the issue some six years later.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Giant&rsquo;s Causeway is a  world heritage site, and that must be borne in mind when proposals are put  forward. I, too, am concerned about the process of the past few days. The  Minister of the Environment issued a statement that she was &ldquo;of a mind&rdquo; to  approve the proposals from Seaport Investments Ltd. However, she insists today  that she has not made a final decision. If that is the case, why did Nigel  Dodds decide, on a whim, to pull out of the  project at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway and withdraw  the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment&rsquo;s interest in it, based on a  statement that Mrs Foster was &ldquo;of a mind&rdquo;?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment has been dealing with the issue and has raised it with the  Minister and his officials. In a briefing today from Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment officials, we learned that, so far, &pound;1&middot;5 million has been  spent on the project. That is a considerable amount of money that will not be  recovered. The fact that there was a competition to submit plans to develop the  site was also raised.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I, too, have serious concerns about the relationship  between the DUP and Mr Sweeney. On the radio today, Mr Sweeney said that he was  a member of the DUP. He was honest about it, but he said that he had never  given money to the party. The DUP is some party if its members do not have to  pay membership; everyone would be queuing to join. The visitors&rsquo; centre must be  replaced, as the issue has been ongoing for too long. I have no objections to  the private sector&rsquo;s becoming involved in the development of the project, but  the sensitivities of the area must be borne in mind in any proposals &mdash; it is a  world heritage site.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">How was the decision reached? There are other stakeholders  in the project &mdash; Moyle District Council and the National Trust, for example.  What negotiations took place with the National Trust over the sensitivities of  the development? The process of the past few days has set a dangerous  precedent: even the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment was not consulted on the  decision. Bearing in mind the importance of the site to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  tourism industry, it is important that the visitors&rsquo; centre be replaced as soon  as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I am a member of the National Trust; I have given it money every month for more  than 20 years, as has my family. It is important to put that on record, given  that such relationships appear to be important to the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The debate was tabled more than a week ago on the pretence  that foot-dragging Ministers Mr Dodds and Mrs  Foster had done nothing. The debate was supposed to have a different colour today: it was going to  criticise two Ministers who have been in office for more than 100 days  and who have failed to solve the crisis at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway. However, when  Ministers remedy that crisis by setting a course of action that will resolve a decade of dilly-dallying and delay, they are condemned  and criticised for all manner of things, and all types of innuendos are thrown  at them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">They are condemned in a manner that is completely  unjustifiable &mdash; the criticism is scurrilous. It says something about the small-minded nature of many people that, when  there is an opportunity to do something good for all the people of Northern  Ireland, they look for a way to kick it instead of letting it be resolved.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  The Member will get a chance in a wee minute, but there are some points that I  intend to make in the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is one of the most important issues that affects my  constituency, because tourism is going to be the future in Northern Ireland.  Tourism projects &mdash; many of which have been announced, such as the Titanic  Quarter, and various golf courses across the Province &mdash; provide an opportunity  to turn Northern Ireland  into a tourist destination, which will make us the envy of this part of Europe. We have an opportunity to get that right, and it is unfortunate that there are  people who want to change the debate in order to prevent that progress.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been some unfortunate focus on the applicant,  rather than the application, on the part of some of the Members who have  spoken. Are Members opposite suggesting that every time an application for  planning permission, or a business plan, comes before any Minister in Northern  Ireland, we examine the applicant to find out whether he is a member of this or  that organisation, or, worse still, whether he is a Protestant or a Roman Catholic, and then decide whether the  applicant should be granted permission or given encouragement by Government?  Are they seriously arguing that someone who is entitled to be a member of a  lawful organisation, which has no bearing on his application, which has been at  the consideration stage for some time, should have that held against them and  be penalised? I hope not, because what we are hearing from the Benches opposite  is an argument for discrim&shy;inating against an applicant, rather than looking at  the salient points of the application.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As some Members have said, let us focus on the fact and  detail of the application and ask whether it is the right way forward for Northern Ireland  to deliver a world-class centre of tourism  excellence. I hope that it is.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>: I will give way very briefly, because the Member has been  persistent if nothing else.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>: The Member said that the Ministers have made a decision in  relation to the matter, and that the purpose of this Adjournment debate &mdash; and  he is correct &mdash; was to highlight the delay in making a decision. However, is it  right for Ministers to make an announcement in the press, but not come to the  House prior to the Adjournment debate to make a statement on this very important  matter and, therefore, not allow Members to question them?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Obviously that is a very pertinent point. I understand that today is 11  September and that the Assembly was recalled yesterday after two months&rsquo;  holiday. At the first available opportunity, the Ministers are in the House to  take part in a debate tabled by the Member&rsquo;s party.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  No, I will not give way. The Member&rsquo;s first attempt was poor, so his second  will only be worse.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will pose some questions that Members should really ask.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>: It is a bit rich for Members opposite to talk about conflicts  of interest in public positions when some of them have spouses who are in very  senior offices in the country, taking decisions about sensitive matters such as  policing. Then they point the finger at anybody else &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Let us not get into personal attacks on Members.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I am quite happy to have a cup of coffee with Mr Donaldson over that point later. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several questions must be asked today. Are the Government  the developers of last resort? Are Members saying, at a time when resources are  finite, that the Government have a public responsibility to build, pay for and  take the risk for everything and let the private sector get away risk free? I  hope that they are not. I hope that we drive forward an economy in Northern Ireland  that tells people that opportunities exist here. I want to drive forward a  dynamic business economy in which opportunities can be provided and,  importantly, facilitated for everyone. I do not believe that the Government  should be seen as a developer of last resort.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members that when the Government last thought of  themselves as developers of last resort and decided that it was their duty to  build tourism facilities, they did so at Navan Fort, which today is a public  disaster. Had that been a private initiative, the risk would have been with the  private sector and the outcome would have been different. With this project, as  with many others, the Government have cleverly transferred the risk to the  private sector but ensured that taxpayers &mdash; the people who really matter &mdash;  continue to benefit from having a centre that has been paid for by private  money. The public will be able to avail of it, and it will be instrumental in  attracting tourists to Northern    Ireland and encouraging them to spend their  money here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members have mentioned a DETI application &mdash; the  elusive alternative planning application &mdash; and work has been done in that  regard. However, I remind Members that any  lobbying that has been done to me by the National Trust and others has  been carried out with the sole purpose of  stymying and delaying the possibility of anything happening at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway. That is sad. The most damning  indictment that I can put on that  organisation is that it should have a different vision for my  constituency. Instead of bickering about an application in the area, it should  see this as a brilliant opportunity to clear the ridge of a lot of horrible  buildings and Portakabins. It should have the vision to see a brand new tourist facility from which it, the public, the  private sector and the public sector can benefit. We have that opportunity, and  it should be taken.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I appeal to people not  to be blackmailed by the threats that  have been put about, the most obvious being that world heritage status  will be removed from the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway if the proposed development goes  ahead. Over the past 10 years, I have taken the opportunity to speak to  representatives of other world heritage sites when they have visited Northern Ireland  from the continent. I have asked them about the accuracy of that threat. They  rubbish that claim. On visiting other world heritage sites such as Niagra Falls,  one will see that buildings have been developed around them, and that those  sites have been developed to encourage visitors. Other world heritage sites,  such as that of the terracotta soldiers in China, have been developed so that  people can go right up to the artefacts and  look at them closely. Visitors are able to see those spectacular tourist  attractions. However, it is right that any development should be carried out  practically, sensitively and in a sustainable manner.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is wrong to say that the standing and status of the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway stones would be jeopardised if a  developer &mdash; no matter who &mdash; were to clear the site of the horrible buildings  and build a new, state-of-the-art tourism centre. That is rubbish: it is  blackmail. We should not have that threat directed at us, and it should not be  held over us like a sword of Damocles that implies that the status of world  heritage site will be withdrawn. I hope that  the organisations and individuals who  are making that threat will withdraw it and recognise that this is an  opportunity for Northern    Ireland to get a world-class visitors&rsquo;  centre urgently, expeditiously, practically and legally. It must happen as soon  as possible, and I encourage Ministers to continue taking positive, proactive  decisions that will help business in Northern Ireland to flourish.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: We have to leave the last ten minutes for the Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  First of all, many people may be disheartened  and depressed by the debate, because having listened to some of those  who have spoken previously criticising the Minister, it seems that we are  engaging in the petty politics of prejudice. The main thrust of the argument,  certainly from Sinn F&eacute;in, seemed to be not so much about the development but  rather the background of the developer. That certainly came through in the  speeches from the Alliance Party and the SDLP, perhaps to a lesser extent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the other hand, perhaps we should be heartened that at  least now we are getting down to the kind of issues that the Executive and the  Assembly are going to have to deal with.  When the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster did a study on tourism, it said  that it could not understand why such a site did not have facilities for visitors. We have to establish how they  can best be provided and what the best methods are of providing them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members of the Assembly, from almost every party,  criticised the Department of the Environment for being slow over the planning  process, and then when the Minister tries to speed up the planning process, she  is thought to be engaged in some kind of skulduggery.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I will be very happy to.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  There is some suggestion in the Chamber today that I took a rushed decision  when I was told that there was to be an Adjournment debate in the House. Anyone  who knows anything about the planning process in Northern Ireland knows that that is  the greatest load of ludicrous nonsense that could be put to the House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When I came into office in May 2007, I was made aware of a  number of article 31 applications that would ultimately come before me for a decision. I was amazed to find  that one for the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway had been  sitting since 2002. That is why I immediately set about looking at it to try to  come to a decision.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague is absolutely right &mdash; when I made up my mind,  I was criticised for doing so, and that is the point that I wanted to make.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for saying that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us just look at three contradictions and the arguments  that have been made. Mr O&rsquo;Loan said that we have a planning application that is  on the point of being granted, but wondered whether it would be delivered. That  is what he said. He wanted to know how profits can be made from parking cars  and serving tea. Therefore, his argument is that DETI should stay involved,  because the project may never be delivered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Then we had the Sinn F&eacute;in Member saying that it was an  absolute scandal to give the contract to a private developer, because Moyle  District Council will be deprived of &pound;250,000 in profits from the centre.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Which is it to be? It is not going to be profitable, so it  should not go to the private sector, or it is going to be too profitable, so it  should be kept in the public sector. The arguments are totally contradictory.  That is one of the reasons I believe that there is something more to the  objections than simply the economics.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The second contradiction is that the planning process  should be transparent and totally accountable, and yet it appears Mr Neeson, Mr  O&rsquo;Loan and the Sinn F&eacute;in Member whose Irish name I cannot pronounce are basing their criticism on the fact that the  contract has been granted to someone whose background they are  suspicious of. What kind of a planning process would we have if decisions were  made on the basis of who the applicant was, rather than what the application  is?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Point of order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  It is important to put on the record that I made no reference to the developer.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is not a point of order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Let me make it clear that when the Minister was considering the planning  application she would have had to consider  the views of the Environment and Heritage Service, for example, and if  there was an element of doubt at all about  the impact on the environ&shy;ment, I know what the decision of the  Environment and Heritage Service would be.  It would tell the Minister to have nothing to do with the application;  and I speak as someone who has criticised the Environment and Heritage Service  and the Planning Service on many occasions.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My third point is in total contrast to what Members heard  from Mr O&rsquo;Loan yesterday. During yesterday&rsquo;s debate on the economy, he told the  House eloquently that we must find new ways of delivering for the economy of Northern Ireland and new ways of  bringing in resources. However, at  the very first hint of a Minister finding  new ways of bringing in resources he is jumping up and down in anger. If  private money is available for the proposed visitor centre, and if that private  money can deliver something that has not been delivered for seven years, then  let us take it. Using private money is one  of the new ways of doing things. What the Ministers have decided, and  the routes that they are taking &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  No, I have to finish soon as the Minister wants to speak.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers are looking for new ways of bringing in  resources, speeding up the planning process, getting decisions made and  delivering, and that is what people want from the Assembly. When Ministers do  that, it should be welcomed, rather than trying to find some Machiavellian  motive behind such decisions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mr  Dodds)</strong>: I congratulate the Member who secured the Adjournment debate. I  welcome the opportunity to discuss this important issue, and it is right that  it should be discussed. The timing is appropriate. It has been recognised on  all sides that the Minister of the Environment, Mrs Foster, who is in the  House, announced yesterday that she is of a mind to approve an outline planning  application by Seaport Investments Ltd for a new visitors&rsquo; centre at the  Giant&rsquo;s Causeway. I welcome the fact that Minister Foster has made her views  known on the merits of that planning application.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Giant&rsquo;s Causeway is  our premier tourist attraction, with over 550,000 visitors in 2006, 80%  of whom were estimated to have come from outside Northern Ireland, and it needs  world-class facilities. I endorse everything that Mr O&rsquo;Loan said about the  importance of the causeway and the need for world-class facilities. That is an  absolute priority. I am sure that Members will agree that the current facilities  are far from ideal and are, quite frankly,  appalling. There is a need to improve all aspects of the facilities  needed for visitors, from education and interpretation to basic amenities such  as toilets. My priority, as the Minister responsible for tourism, is that those world-class facilities are  delivered &mdash; not how, or by whom they are delivered; it is that they are  delivered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much has been said about what the Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment is doing. In 2003, under  a different Administration and different Ministers, the Department  worked with key stakeholders at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway,  including Moyle District Council, which owns the land on which the current  facilities are built, and the National Trust, which owns the actual causeway  site as well as the shop and caf&eacute;. At that time, the Department and the  Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB)  assumed the lead in developing a proposal for a new centre, and they did so at the request of Moyle  District Council and others who simply could not, unfortunately, find a way  forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the Government&rsquo;s position at that time was  to be the developer of last resort: in other words, they did not want to be in  that position at all, and they felt that they should not have to be in that  position. The Government did not own any land at the causeway and felt that it  was up to the council and other stakeholders to do the job. Central Government  were not in the business of designing and running visitors&rsquo; centres. That job was  best left to local stakeholders, councils, or the private sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Following the burning of the previous council-owned centre  in April 2000, there were a series of initiatives by the council to rebuild the  visitors&rsquo; centre. Moyle District Council  went down the road of a process and a competition, and it was open to  the idea of offers to build a centre that could have included non-public  enterprises. That will be of interest to Mr McKay, who said in a weekend press  report that he was against anything that involved the private element and that  it was in the interests of local people that  the visitors&rsquo; centre remained  under public ownership. The key issue for Mr McKay is that the visitors&rsquo; centre  remains in public ownership &mdash; and he takes a dogmatic view on that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Sean Neeson said, the previous Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment tried to find a way forward that would have allowed for the building  of a new visitors&rsquo; centre. It was only in the absence of agreement that the  then Moyle District Council asked the then Government to take the lead in  developing new facilities. We could go into the ins and outs of whether or not  direct rule Ministers made decisions and for whatever reasons, but, no doubt,  they acted in good faith. They were obviously influenced by the fact that if we  are to capitalise on the potential for tourism in Northern Ireland, we must develop  our tourism infrastructure. I believe that they reluctantly assumed the role of  developer of last resort.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some might ask why, in 2003, the then Government did not  await the determination on the Seaport Invest&shy;ments  Ltd outline planning application before embarking on an international design competition for a new  centre. That is a good question, which direct rule Ministers will have to answer. Devolved Ministers may well  have taken that decision, but it was more important to get a speedy answer and outcome to the planning application  than to incur substantial public  expenditure on something that has now probably turned out to be  nugatory. That is a matter for those former Ministers to address.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the devolved Administration took office and the current Ministers came into their posts, they  inherited a process that had been  long delayed, and they recognised a  need for action. I commend Minister Foster for making the Causeway  centre a priority issue &mdash; and she has taken the opportunity today to set out  why she did that &mdash; and for making her views  on that complex application known so quickly after coming into office.  As Gregory Campbell rightly said, the application will be subjected to the most  rigorous scrutiny &mdash; as it should be.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McKay raised the issue of why the decision was taken  when the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) project, along  with other stake&shy;holders, was so close to  reaching the stage of a planning application being made. If only that  were the case. The DETI/NITB project would have had to overcome significant  obstacles. The identification of suitable car-parking provision has proved to  be particularly difficult, and remains  unsolved to this day. No planning application  could have been lodged without that problem being solved. The consequent  delays, along with construction price inflation, increased the estimated cost  to &pound;21&middot;5 million &mdash; a considerable amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear from Minister Foster&rsquo;s statement that she sees  merit in the Seaport Investments Ltd application, and that she is of a mind to approve it. As a consequence, and  in those circumstances, my Department would be reckless to take any decision  other than to say that it will not be progressing with further expenditure and work on the current proposal. It would simply be  wrong to commit further taxpayers&rsquo; money to a project that, it would  appear, will likely not be required. The rationale for the Government&rsquo;s  involvement as a developer of last resort is no longer compelling. It would not  be in the public interest to proceed to spend more money on working up  proposals and, possibly, spend &pound;21 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money on a centre when  an alternative private-sector proposal could be developed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Even though the Government will no longer be the developer  of a new visitors&rsquo; centre, my Department will continue to take a close interest  in the efforts to have a world-class visitors&rsquo; centre at the Giant&rsquo;s   Causeway. The objective remains to ensure that the many thousands  of tourists who visit what has often been described as the eighth wonder of the  world receive an experience that does  justice to that description. Similar to Minister Foster, I am keen that  the key stakeholders at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway &mdash; The National Trust and Moyle  District Council &mdash; should work together and in partnership with the private  sector investor to ensure that future visitors receive the best possible  experience.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will deal briefly with a number of points that have been  raised. Mr McKay talked of the need to protect the revenue stream of Moyle  District Council. That is not the primary  purpose of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. Our  primary purpose is to promote world-class facilities for tourism in Northern Ireland. Mr McKay may see that as his primary objective,  but, in those comments, he reveals more about where he is coming from than  anything else could.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan talked of the need for a ministerial statement to  the Assembly, and Mr Maginness, from a sedentary position, made the point that  he was not so much criticising what Minister Foster had done, but the way in  which she had done it. My statement, on behalf of my Department, simply  explained the logical implications for the prospect of the proposal from DETI  and NITB and the implications of Minister Foster&rsquo;s decision on that project. I  made my statement in the knowledge that the Assembly would have the opportunity  to debate the matter today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan talked about the lack of communication with  stakeholders.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>:  No, I will not give way, because I have very little time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">DETI could not  communicate with anyone in respect of a statement by the planning  Minister, which was issued only yesterday.  As far as lack of consultation with the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment is  concerned, it was not for me to deal with that matter, because the decision was taken by the planning Minister.  However, when the Committee asked my officials to come here today, they made  themselves available at very short notice to explain to the Committee, in great  detail, the issues as my Department sees them. I made sure that that happened  as soon as was possible and appropriate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department&rsquo;s priorities are to ensure that the site has  a world-class facility; that the criteria for preserving World Heritage status  are maintained &mdash; that is a matter that the planners, as Mr Sammy Wilson said,  will examine closely; that it is done with the best possible value for money to the public purse; and that it is done as quickly as possible. That is all I am  interested in. That is all the House should be interested in.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If Members really had taxpayers&rsquo; interests at heart, they  should not decry our efforts or take a dogmatic Marxist approach, which says  that only the public sector can deliver. We have seen what has happened &mdash; delay, delay and delay. Action is finally being  taken to deliver the project at the best possible value for money.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 4.56 pm.</p>
