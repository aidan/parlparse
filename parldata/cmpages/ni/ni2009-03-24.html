    <p class="H4StageHeading">Draft Renewables Obligation Order (Northern Ireland)  2009</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Draft Renewables Obligation Order (Northern Ireland)  2009 be approved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The statutory rule is being made under powers contained in  the Energy (Northern Ireland)  Order 2003, which prescribes that the 2009 Order must be laid in draft for  approval by an affirmative resolution of the Assembly. The Order under  discussion today is the culmination of a programme of work that involved close  consultation with industry and other stakeholders on the development of the  policy on renewable energy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The changes were subject to a statutory consultation  process that closed in December 2008. The primary powers for the amendments  were established through the Energy (Amendment) Order (Northern Ireland)  2009, which was approved by the Assembly in January 2009. The Order introduces  important changes to the Northern    Ireland renewables obligation (NIRO). By  making NIRO more efficient and effective, the changes will better enable us to  meet the targets on renewable electricity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Similar changes are also being made to the renewable  obligations in Scotland, England and Wales. The renewable obligations  work in harmony across the United    Kingdom, and, therefore, it is important  that all changes are made at the same time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Renewable energy is a vital part of the Department&rsquo;s  strategy to tackle the two major challenges of ensuring a secure supply of  energy for Northern Ireland  and combating climate change. As Northern Ireland&rsquo;s main mechanism  for encouraging new renewable electricity generation, it is crucial that NIRO  is as effective as possible, and it has been successful so far. When NIRO was  introduced in 2005, just under 3% of electricity produced in Northern Ireland  was renewable. Today, 7% of electricity produced and consumed in Northern Ireland  is renewable, which is a higher percentage than ever before.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, NIRO must deliver even more. I will soon consult  on a new strategic energy framework that will contain proposals to set higher  targets for renewable electricity, which is vital in securing Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  energy supply and combating climate change.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Order that is under consideration makes some  fundamental changes to the NIRO, which will allow it to bring forward a higher  level of renewables generation from a wide range of sources. The most  significant of those changes is the introduction of banding. The NIRO was designed  originally as a technology-neutral instrument, intended to pull through the  most economic forms of renewable generation. It has delivered on that, and is  proving to be particularly successful in bringing forward technologies such as  onshore wind. However, it is never wise to rely wholly on one technology and to  put all our eggs in one energy basket. That is why we do not rely solely on one  fuel for conventional power generation, and it is also why we need a greater  contribution from other renewable technologies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Banding will enable us to provide higher levels of support  to technologies that are further from market. Currently, each megawatt hour of  eligible generation is awarded one renewables obligation certificate (ROC). A  banded NIRO will mean that different technologies will get different numbers of  ROCs. For example, anaerobic digestion will receive more ROCs than onshore  wind. Furthermore, all microgenerators &mdash; defined as those that will generate a  capacity of up to 50 kilowatts &mdash; will receive two ROCs for each megawatt hour,  irrespective of technology.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members will know that my Department consulted on  keeping one ROC per megawatt hour for landfill gas in Northern Ireland, whereas the rest of the UK is banding  down to one quarter ROC per megawatt hour. The consultation response has  supported that position because of the relative lack of development of landfill  gas compared with the rest of the UK where landfill gas is highly  developed. It was on that basis that we in Northern Ireland applied for EU  state-aid clearance. Unfortunately, that clearance was not forthcoming in the  time frame available. However, because of the need to bring the revised NIRO in  together with the other renewables obligations in the UK from 1  April, we have to lay the Order on the basis of the quarter ROC until we can  get state-aid clearance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Should EU state-aid clearance be forthcoming &mdash; and I am  confident that it will be &mdash; it is my intention to lay a further Order to amend  the banding of landfill gas up to one ROC per megawatt hour at the earliest  opportunity thereafter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are not alone in that position. Many Members will be  aware that Scotland has  proposed higher bands for wave and tidal power than the rest of the UK. It has also  not received state-aid clearance in time and has had to lay its legislation on  the basis of the GB position. I know that many Members will question why Northern Ireland  is also not aiming for higher ROCs for tidal stream and wave power. We do not  have the power here to issue ROCs for offshore generation. That power is  exercised by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) in Westminster, but I intend  to discuss the position with DECC at the earliest opportunity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If we are able to amend the legislation so that offshore  generation is eligible for Northern Ireland ROCs, I will consider the  appropriate level of support for those technologies as part of the programme of  work under the offshore wind and marine renewable strategic action plan, which  will be issued for consultation in the autumn.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The banding levels in the Order were based on research into  the costs and market potential of each technology type, and the Order details a  process for the banding levels to be periodically reviewed. That balances the  need to provide investors with a stable support framework while ensuring that  we can respond to market developments, so that the banding levels continue to  provide the right level of incentive for project developers. That is very  important.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to banding, we are making a number of small  technical and administrative changes to the Order. We have addressed that issue  through previous amend&shy;ments to the NIRO, and we are now making further  improvements to the administrative require&shy;ments for microgenerators, to remove  the barriers to participation in the NIRO, which some small generators face.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Technologies such as wind often get most of the coverage in  these debates, but we also have the potential to generate electricity from  biomass and waste. Many Members are rightly concerned about the sustainability  of those fuels, and I recognise those issues. However, to ensure that the UK as a whole  has a better understanding of the issue, the Order introduces a sustainability  reporting requirement on all but the smallest generators who use biomass.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To protect investment decisions made on the information  available at the time, we are committed to the principle of grandfathering.  Subject to certain exceptions, stations in existence when the proposal to  introduce banding was announced will continue to receive one ROC per megawatt  hour.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the costs of administering the renewables  obligation will be better met by those who actually participate in the scheme  and who will therefore benefit from the changes that we are introducing. That  is the reason that a further change is being made to the NIRO, in that the  costs of the administration of the scheme will be met from the buy-out fund  rather than from public funds. That is a change from the current situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed amendments to the NIRO are important for the  long-term future of its operation and to the long-term future of renewable  electricity in Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (Ms J McCann)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  The Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment considered proposals to replace The Renewables Obligation  (NI) Order 2007. It noted the proposed introduction of banding, which would  permit the different renewable technologies to be grouped into separate bands,  with the result that different levels of support would be offered, depending on  the cost of the technology that is involved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee expressed the wider concern, which was  repeated in the Assembly in January 2009, that the renewables obligation  certificates here and the renewable electricity feed-in tariffs in the South  are not compatible. Therefore, it seems somewhat wrong to suggest that we have  a single-electricity market, when the two schemes to provide incentives for  generating renewable electricity result in operators on one side of the border  not being able to avail themselves of incentives to provide electricity to  suppliers on the other side of the border. As Committee members stated in  January, the Committee will keep a close watch on that matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Following a briefing from departmental officials on the  outcome of the consultation and consideration of the proposals on 5 February  2009, the Committee subsequently considered the draft Renewables Obligation  (NI) Order 2009 on 12 March 2009. The Committee recommends that the Assembly  affirm the draft Order. Go raibh maith agat</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I support the draft Order. It is important to do so, and I acknowledge the  success of the renewables obligation in general. It has helped us to tap into  our widely recognised renewable energy potential in Northern Ireland and to make  progress towards achieving the target of having 12% of our energy come from  renewables by 2012. The renewables obligation will also set the context for  growing that potential further in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister and the previous Member to speak pointed out  that the introduction of banding and allocating different quantities of ROCs  for different types of renewable energies is the major change that the  proposals will make to the renewables obligation. There was some concern in the  Committee &mdash; which I shared &mdash; about the potential of wave energy. As the  Minister said, whenever we discuss renewables, we are somewhat fascinated by  windmills and the potential of wind energy; however, there is great potential  in Northern Ireland  to produce offshore wave energy. There was concern that Scotland had sought to award more renewables  obligation certificates for wave energy than would be available in Northern Ireland.  However, the Assembly will be pleased to know that the European Union did not  grant that derogation to Scotland,  meaning that Scotland has no  particular advantage over us in that respect because the ROCS that will be  awarded there will remain at the same level as those that will be awarded in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have spoken to some in the wave-energy industry who are  seeking to tap into that potential. They said that they view investment in grid  infrastructure as being much more important than the numbers of ROCs that they  receive. Although Scotland  may have equal or greater offshore wave-energy potential than we do in Northern Ireland,  it tends to be located beyond the reach of the marketplace. Although that  potential exists in Scotland,  it is hard to get the energy that is produced to consumers quickly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister also mentioned the ongoing strategic energy  framework review. I hope that in tandem with that review, the narrow proposed  changes to the NIRO will strengthen and create investment in the grid and  further tap into our very obvious renewable energy potential. That will ensure  that Northern Ireland  will not only be able to reach, but surpass the 12% target by 2012 and develop  renewable forms of energy to ever greater levels in the future.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  welcome the draft Renewables Obligation Order (Northern Ireland) 2009. The  Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment has considered the Order and is very much in favour of it.  In the present climate, it is important that we maximise the use of renewables.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, however, we need to sort out the issue of  renewables obligation certificates.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am disappointed at the Environment Minister&rsquo;s attitude to  wind power. Wind power is a major asset that we have in not only Northern Ireland, but in the island of Ireland,  and the Republic is, in many ways, clearly forging ahead much more than Northern Ireland  in the development of wind power. It is important that we maximise the  potential of that energy source.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As well as maximising the use of wind power, it is  important that we develop tidal and wave power. Furthermore, the use of biomass  for electricity generation is an issue that needs to be developed. In the first  mandate after devolution, the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment visited Denmark  to explore how various materials are used to develop energy and electricity. In  particular, I remember our visit to a plant in Copenhagen, which generated electricity from  waste. That process is being considered by Belfast City Council, and it should  be given serious consideration. Although I recognise that certain elements of  the green lobby are opposed to that, it is worthy of serious consideration, and  should be developed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, in the current economic climate, the Assembly  and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) should follow the  lead that has been taken by President Obama in developing the green economy,  because there are opportunities for us to develop the green economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister is aware, the Committee has been  considering the security of supply, whether of electricity or natural gas. That  is why I am considering with interest the developments of the storage of  natural gas. As the Minister is well aware, a location in my East   Antrim constituency is being surveyed for its viability as a  potential gas storage facility. I hope that there will be a successful outcome  to that survey and that that security of supply for natural gas will be  provided for Northern Ireland,  as has happened in so many other parts of the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the draft Order, and I look forward to its  implementation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  did not, perhaps, expect to be called to speak so quickly &#8213; two Alliance  Members in a row. It is disappointing that there has not been more debate on  this topic in the Chamber. We are progressing what is, in effect, a piece of  legislation, which will have a practical impact on society in Northern Ireland.  Later this morning, we will be discussing a private Member&rsquo;s motion on climate  change. Worthy as it is, it is still a non-binding resolution, and, no doubt,  we will discuss it for an hour and a half, as we do all private Member&rsquo;s  motions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion that we are debating has practical importance,  but, so far, only five Members have spoken in the debate. That is  disappointing, and strange with regard to the priorities of parties in how they  are approaching the matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like my colleague, I welcome and support the draft  Renewables Obligation Order (Northern    Ireland) 2009. It is important that we move  forward on the basis of that Order and that we, as an Assembly, are open to a  wide range of potential sources of renewable energy and do not close our minds  to any of them. Although I am an environmentalist I am also a pragmatist, and I  recognise that there are different opinions and options on the table.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My main concern is that although we are moving forward on  the renewables obligation with respect to electricity generators, we must be  aware of the wider context in which we are working and the importance of  joined-up Government. There are concerns about what is happening elsewhere in  Government, particularly in the planning system, in relation to renewable  energy. Although today we are, quite rightly, asking more from electricity  generators, there are concerns that the planning system is not keeping up to  speed with respect to giving generators the tools they need in order to provide  the infrastructure that will meet the new obligations that we are asking of  them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are concerns about draft Planning Policy Statement  18, particularly the supplementary guidance arising from that in relation to  the potential for the size and scope of wind turbines. There are concerns also  about the areas in Northern    Ireland where such turbines could  potentially be located.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is my understanding that there is sufficient interest in  wind power and that there is potential for wind turbines, placed at different  locations in Northern    Ireland, to meet the different targets that  we, as a society, are setting ourselves. However, it seems that the  infrastructure for that may not be put in place because of the way in which our  planning policy is going to be structured, never mind the speed of decision  making in the planning system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In essence, I make a plea for more joined-up Government in  dealing with such matters. I respect the leadership that the Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment has shown, but there is a need for better  joined-up Government and better co-ordination in the Executive and between the  different Departments with responsibility for renewable energy, so that Northern Ireland  can have a more rounded solution and can move forward successfully.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note that the United Kingdom is thirteenth in the  European league table of wind energy capacity per capita. Given our  geographical location, we have a lot of potential to move up the table.  Countries such as Denmark  and Spain  are well ahead of us, but other countries, which may not have the same  geographical advantages as us, are doing better than us on a per capita basis.  That should drive us on to do a lot better. Even in the context of the UK, Northern Ireland is behind the other  regions. Those facts point to the work that is required of us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we can pass this Order today, it has to be seen as  one part of a much wider debate. Major questions must be asked about what other  parts of Government are doing, as that will enable us to meet the challenges as  a whole.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement. I have a couple of issues to bring to  her attention that I would appreciate a response to, if possible. Renewable  energy is important to us all. I will focus on wind farms, because I believe  that that source of renewable energy can bring direct advantages for many  people and can help the Minister and the Assembly achieve their targets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This morning, I heard on the news that the RSPB has made a  statement about wind farms. It said that it is not against them providing they  are not located in environmentally sensitive areas, particularly areas that are  important for bird life. Has the Minister had time to examine the statement? If  so, what are her feelings in relation to it?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some time ago, when I was wearing my other hat as a member  of Ards Borough Council, comments were made to us about putting wind farms on  Strangford Lough.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of my concerns &mdash; which is fairly rich coming from a  person who shoots ducks &mdash; is that if wind farms were placed strategically in  Strangford Lough they could probably do more harm to the wildfowl than Jim  Shannon could ever do with a 12 bore, and, for that reason, I thought that this  morning&rsquo;s statement from the RSPB was important. I am keen to hear what the  Minister has to say about that. It would appear that there could be a meeting  of minds and, if that were possible, we should look at how that could be  brought forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My final point relates to the financial incentives to  farmers and landowners who are trying to diversify. Wind farms may be one way  in which they can diversify, generate an income, not hurt the environment, and  be sensitive to their neighbours as regards the noise from wind farms. What are  the incentives for landowners, farmers &mdash; and everyone &mdash; to look after the  environment?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I thank those Members who contributed to the debate. I am  particularly grateful to the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment for its  support and patience through the long process of bringing in these changes to  the NIRO, and for its contribution today through the Deputy Chairperson.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Deputy Chairperson mentioned an issue that I knew would  come up &mdash; the difference between the feed-in tariff and the NIRO. Although I  understand the view that she expressed on behalf of the Committee, it was not  the view expressed by the majority of consultees, and it did not come out of  the consultation either. I can see the logic of the Deputy Chairperson&rsquo;s and  the Committee&rsquo;s argument about the single electricity market and, because of  that, I said that we will keep watch on that and do all that we can to tie it  up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we must also be cognisant of those people who have  invested in renewable energy here on the basis that a renewables obligation  system is in place and, therefore, they will take advantage from that. It would  send out a negative signal to people who have made investment decisions if one  were to start chopping and changing the system, and I do not want Northern Ireland  to be seen as a risky place in which to invest in renewables &mdash; that is the last  message that we want to send out. We need more renewable energy. I will not do  anything to jeopardise that, and I know that the Committee will understand that  position.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton referred to the potential of renewable energy  and the role of the NIRO in incentivising that, and he is absolutely right.  There is potential in wave energy. That is one of the reasons why I will be  discussing our territorial waters with the Department in Westminster in order to see what can be done  on that issue. The &lsquo;Northern Ireland Strategic Energy Framework 2009&rsquo; is a  hugely important document. I hope that, when we consult on that document,  people will become involved in the consultation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Neeson said that we should maximise the use of  renewables. However, wind power is &ldquo;not the only fruit&rdquo;. We recognise the  importance of wind power &mdash; we did so, in particular, in the past when we  started to look at renewable energy &mdash; but we must look at the wider picture. We  cannot put all our eggs in one basket, and that is why the banding proposals  are coming forward today. Mr Neeson talked about the landfill gas, and that is  one reason why energy from waste will receive one ROC. We believe that it is  important to incentivise different types of renewable energy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was a little disappointed by comments that were made at  the Alliance Party conference at the weekend, which suggested that we were not  engaged with the green economy. I dispute that wholeheartedly. The Member will  know the reason for that, because part of the focus of our new  interdepartmental working group on sustainable energy is on the green economy  and on looking for new opportunities for green jobs. Mr Neeson mentioned gas  storage and compressed air. He will know about the opportunities that are  available for that in Larne Lough, and we want to develop such things.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with Dr Farry that it is hugely disappointing that  neither the Ulster Unionist Party nor the SDLP thought it worthwhile to speak  on this important piece of legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I can only conclude that they would rather propose a  private Member&rsquo;s motion. That is a stunt, whereas this piece of legislation  will make a real impact on renewable energy. It is disappointing to note that  this morning.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to draft Planning Policy Statement 18, the  draft supplementary planning guidance raised a number of concerns about some  elements of the wind-farm industry. My Department is proactively working with  the Department of the Environment, and Mr Farry knows that it is a balancing  act between protecting very beautiful rural landscapes and giving impetus to  renewable energies. When the SPG is produced, I hope that it will be a balanced  document that will take into account everything that we have said about  renewable energies and wind farms.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am certainly encouraged by the Minister&rsquo;s comments. Does she agree that wind  farms could, in some cases, enhance the landscape of Northern Ireland in that people  would see them as a sign of progress and engagement with the environment?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The landscape is never a constant: it is always evolving.  Although there are some very sensitive areas of Northern Ireland, a wind farm on a  hilltop &mdash; in other areas &mdash; could be seen as a source of pride.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: If the Member had listened to the Member who spoke after him,  he would appreciate the difficulties with which we must deal because wind farms  are a subjective issue. I did not think that I would ever hear Mr Shannon  wanting to protect the birds of Strangford. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> He wanted to ensure that Strangford Lough &mdash; which is an environmentally  sensitive area &mdash; was protected. It is important that the draft supplementary  planning guidance achieves the right balance, which is why we have engaged with  the Department of the Environment. When the final document is published, I have  every reason to be confident that it will deal with some of the objections that  have been made thus far.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I firmly believe that the Order will  contribute to the further development of the renewables sector in Northern Ireland.  It will also support the higher levels of renewable electricity that are needed  to reduce carbon emissions and &mdash; importantly &mdash; to secure our energy supply.  Therefore, I commend the motion to the Assembly.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyText">First, I apologise for the absence of the Chairperson of the  Audit Committee. Unfortunately, he had another engagement that clashed with  this morning&rsquo;s debate. He sends his apologies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Deputy Chairperson of the Audit Committee, I introduce  the motion that is tabled in the Chairperson&rsquo;s name on behalf of the Committee.  The governing legislation for the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s salary is  the Audit (Northern Ireland)  Order 1987, which allows for the salary to be fixed by resolution of the  Assembly. The annual salary increase is payable on 1 April 2009. Therefore, a  resolution must be agreed by the Assembly on or before that date.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2008, the Assembly agreed that Standing Order 58 should  provide a mechanism to update the salary of the Comptroller and Auditor General  annually. Accordingly, it falls to the Audit Committee to review how the salary  be determined and to propose a motion to the Assembly that recommends what it  deems to be a reasonable increase for the year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion proposes that the Assembly should resolve to pay  the Comptroller and Auditor General a salary for 2009-2010 that is in line with  the Senior Salaries Review Body&rsquo;s recommendations for the judicial group 5  rate. The Senior Salaries Review Body is an independent body, and its report is  currently being scrutinised at Westminster.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During suspension, it was agreed by the Audit Committee,  the Department of Finance and Personnel and the Comptroller and Auditor General  that the salary should be linked to the judicial group 5 rate. That decision  has been endorsed by the Committee in successive years after consideration of  the following factors: section 65(6) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 provides  that the Assembly cannot reduce the salary payable to the Comptroller and  Auditor General; in addition, the salary must be less than the highest salary  paid to a public servant in Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee reviewed those parameters and the increases  recommended by the Senior Salaries Review Body in previous years. The Committee  concluded that the judicial group 5 rate was a reasonable benchmark for the  salary of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Senior Salaries Review Body report on judicial salaries  for 2009-2010 has not yet been published. Therefore, the motion provides that  the salary increase should be paid retrospectively to 1 April 2009 once the  recommendation is published. The report will be placed in the Assembly Library  as soon as it becomes available. The Audit Committee has undertaken to review  this arrangement when the current Comptroller and Auditor General retires later  this year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In agreeing this motion, Members will be maintaining an  agreement that the Audit Committee has fully scrutinised and with which its  members are unanimously content.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly determines that the salary to be paid,  under Article 4(1) of the Audit (Northern Ireland) Order 1987, to the holder of  the office of Comptroller and Auditor General from 1 April 2009 to 31 March  2010, shall be the amount recommended by the Review Body on Senior Salaries as  payable for that year to the judiciary at salary group 5.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Act on CO2 Advertising Campaign</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The next item on the Order Paper is the motion on the Act on CO2  advertising campaign. A valid petition of concern in respect of that motion was  presented earlier today. Having checked the petition, the Speaker regarded it  as fulfilling the requirements of Standing Order 28. However, the presentation  of that petition means that the vote on the motion may not be held at the  conclusion of today&rsquo;s debate. At its lunchtime meeting today, the Business  Committee will consider when the vote on the motion will be taken.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members should also note that the vote on the motion will  be taken on a cross-community basis. However, the petition does not affect the  amendment, and the vote on the amendment may proceed today. Members who wish to  inspect the petition of concern may do so at the Business Office.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members may, of course, contribute to the debate itself.  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minute in which to propose  and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who are  called to speak will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes with concern the attempt by the  Minister of the Environment to block the Department of Energy and Climate  Change advertising campaign Act on CO2; further notes that the position is  contrary to the targets set out in the Programme for Government to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions by 25% below 1990 levels by 2025; and calls on the  Minister of the Environment to remove his opposition to the Act on CO2  advertising campaign.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The following are not my words, but the words of Senator  John McCain, the most recent Republican candidate for the American presidency:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I know that climate change is real. We can have a  debate about how serious it is, but the debate about climate change is over.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It can be said that the Republican Party has, for  some time, maintained a healthy scepticism about man-made climate change.  However, in light of the growing weight of scientific evidence, its members now  realise that to deny climate change, sit on their hands and do nothing is  logically and morally wrong.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our Environment Minister has tried to paint a picture that  anyone who proclaims that climate change is real, man-made and a threat is a  confused ideologue intent on destroying our economy. It is patent nonsense to  adopt such a position: the Minister of the Environment is single-handedly  isolating Northern Ireland  on this key issue, and he is making us all look like dangerous radicals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That view is shared by many people including Neil Adger, an  expert on climate-change adaptation from Northern   Ireland who is now based at the University of East Anglia&rsquo;s  Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. He has stated that the basis  science is so clear and unambiguous that anyone denying it is either a fool or  is deliberately misleading others for political or other ends. That opinion is  backed up by David King, the UK Government&rsquo;s former chief scientific adviser,  and Gabrielle Walker, who have stated that people who question the evidence:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;either have a vested interest in ignoring the  scientific arguments or they are fools.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those people are not ideologues, and they are not left-wing  radicals. They are scientists and commentators who have based their opinions on  the available evidence and facts. Most of all, they are pragmatists who  recognise the long-term danger that climate change poses for the United  Kingdom&rsquo;s economy and security; they are pragmatists who recognise the  long-term human cost of doing nothing, and they are pragmatists who realise  that people in the developing world will pay the heaviest price for the ostrich  impersonations of people such as Mr Wilson.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am beginning to wonder why we should expect anything more  from a DUP Minister. We are becoming increasingly aware that that party has no  vision for the future as it repeatedly exalts and practises economic and fiscal  short-termism. Indeed, the DUP has more in common with the Scottish Nationalist  Party than with genuine unionists, and it appears to think that it is either  above, or immune to, scientific and public opinion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Minister Wilson&rsquo;s opposition to the UK Department of Energy  and Climate Change&rsquo;s (DECC) advertising campaign is perhaps the most ludicrous  and dangerous develop&shy;ment in his radicalism. The advertisements urge people  and businesses to reduce energy consumption and cut carbon emissions. That  seems to be the most positive and beneficial of messages that any Government  could produce. Indeed, it is directly in line with the Executive&rsquo;s targets and  the message they delivered to the public. In their Programme for Government,  the Northern Ireland Executive state:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is clear that climate change is one of the most  serious problems facing the world. While we recognise that it requires action  internationally, we are determined to play our part in addressing this  challenge by reducing our impact on climate change &hellip; our carbon footprint is  relatively high and well beyond a level that is sustainable in the  longer-term.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It appears that no one told Sammy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are also targets to reduce greenhouse gas 25% below  1990 levels by 2025. Minister Wilson blatantly contradicted the Executive&rsquo;s  policies on climate change in a letter to the Secretary of State for Energy and  Climate Change. That raises serious issues about ministerial collective  responsibility and the ministerial code. In the system of government that we  work under, does the Minister have the right to act as he did?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Act on CO2 adverts have the objective and potential to  reduce our carbon emissions and save families and businesses money, but Mr Wilson  called them an &ldquo;insidious propaganda campaign&rdquo;. His party colleague, the  Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, gives money to the Carbon Trust  in order to increase businesses&rsquo; energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions  &mdash; does the Minister of the Environment consider that to be an insidious waste  of resources? What does he think of the &pound;18 million that such initiatives saved  local businesses in Northern    Ireland last year?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Minister Wilson has been quoted as saying that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;As the world recession bites, countries are looking  at what is practical in terms of keeping their economies going, as opposed to  what the environmentalists might like.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Minister has badly misjudged the international  community, the business community and the UK Government. The CBI recently  criticised the UK Government for not doing enough to lead the way in low-carbon  technologies. It stated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;With increasing globalisation, the UK has an  opportunity to enter and lead in new markets estimated at $1 trillion.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It went on to state that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The UK  needs to act now if it is to be a low-carbon leader.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, announced that he expects  that the green economy will create 400,000 new jobs in the next eight years,  and Barack Obama has pledged billions of dollars to ensure that green energy  forms part of America&rsquo;s  economic resurgence. Left to Minister Wilson, Northern Ireland will be absent  when opportunities arise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wilson and his DUP colleagues have been naysayers,  scaremongers, critics and Back-Benchers all their political lives. Mr Wilson  has not yet realised that he is a Minister with responsibilities, an expectant  public and a Department. London and Brussels are setting high  environmental standards which, regardless of whether the Minister agrees with  them, we must implement. His antiquated position on climate change makes the  work of his Department and officials extremely difficult and, I am sure,  embarrassing at times. However, he has already shown through his criticism of  the Planning Service that he is not scared to transfer his own failings onto  his staff.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Minister Wilson, writing &mdash; on behalf of us all &mdash; to Ed  Miliband, the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, said that the  advertising campaign promotes anthropogenic climate-change gospel, which is  contrary to his views as Minister of the Environment in Northern Ireland.  He went on to say that he does not believe that man-made greenhouse-gas  emissions are the main cause of climate change, and that he does not believe  that the Act on CO2 messaging should appear in Northern Ireland. He also went on  to say that language should be tempered where possible to take into account  local difference in opinion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The only differences of opinion in this place are between  the Minister and his own party manifesto; the Minister and the Programme for  Government; the Minister and this Assembly; and the Minister and the public at  large. The Minister should withdraw his opposition to the advertising campaign  which would help us meet our agreed and binding targets and also help families  and businesses alike to save money. The Minister&rsquo;s opposition highlights the  worst form of blinkered Northern    Ireland nationalism and the worst type of  arrogance possible. Despite the overwhelming evidence, he believes that  everyone else is wrong and that he is right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Richard Girling, writing in &lsquo;The Times&rsquo;, correctly  highlighted that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Those on Planet Exxon are beyond the pull of reason.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: At end insert</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;; and, mindful of the Environment Committee&rsquo;s vote of no  confidence in the Minister of the Environment, calls on the Executive to launch  a cross-departmental advertising campaign on climate change aimed at achieving  the Programme for Government environmental protection targets.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are two main points to the amendment. First, there is  the matter of the vote of no confidence in the Minister that was passed at the  Environment Committee and, secondly, the need for a cross-departmental approach  to the issue of climate change.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When the vote of no confidence was passed, the Minister&rsquo;s  colleagues rushed quickly out of the meeting to tell the media that &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I will not. Mr Weir was among those Members who rushed out to tell the media  that this was &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I am sure the media will confirm, any  discussions that I had or interview that I gave took place after the meeting  was over. Is it in order for the Member to deliberately mislead the House?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is not a point of order. The Member should resume his seat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  On a point of order. The question is &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Mr Deputy Speaker, are you going to rule on a Member shouting from a sedentary  position? The question is this: is it in order for the Member to deliberately  mislead the House?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member is not misleading the House. There is no evidence to  say one way or the other; it is a point of view.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The DUP spokespersons tried to dismiss that vote  of no confidence as a political game or stunt. To refresh everybody&rsquo;s minds, I  will read from the Programme for Government:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We are becoming increasingly aware of both the global  and local threats to our natural and built environments. It is clear that  climate change is one of the most serious problems facing the world. While we  recognise that it requires action internationally, we are determined to play  our part in addressing this challenge.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">One of the ways in which we can do that is by  reducing our impact on climate change.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We have the lowest levels on these islands of  electricity generated from renewable sources and our carbon footprint is  relatively high and well beyond a level that is sustainable in the longer-term.  At a local level, therefore, action is needed to protect our built heritage,  our landscape and marine environment and to reduce our impact on climate  change.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That was one of the reasons behind the vote of no  confidence in the Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Climate change resulting from greenhouse gas emissions is  now a universally accepted reality. The signs are all around us &mdash; warmer  temperatures; extreme weather, and we know all too well about melting glaciers  and the impact that that has on animal and plant life cycles. In the face of  overwhelming evidence about that link, our Environment Minister has, on so many  occasions, rejected the fact that climate change has been man-made. He has  allied himself with the sceptics and made himself and his Department appear  silly and irrelevant at times. It is a stance that has alarmed many people who  realise that there is a serious problem and has alarmed all of the people who  care passionately about the environment and the consequences of climate change  &mdash; consequences which they see as catastrophic.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The sceptics argue that the earth&rsquo;s climate has always  changed and that it is no different now. That is true; however, it is not an  argument against the change that we are experiencing and that is a direct result  of the actions of humans and the resulting carbon emissions. The climate does  not change spontaneously. There has always been some driver behind the change.  For example, the ice age came to an end because the sun moved closer to the  earth. There is nothing like that to explain &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> There are no natural drivers behind the change in climate. For the benefit of  the Minister, I will state, once again, that there are no natural drivers  powerful enough to produce the level of warming that we have experienced. I  refer to a lead author from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, who  is also a professor at the University   of East Anglia. He said  that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Anyone who disputes these facts is either a fool or  seeking deliberately to mislead for political or other purposes.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our neighbouring Governments in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland  have joined with most of the industrial countries across the world to tackle  climate change. They are making efforts to reduce dependence on fossil fuels  and to cut back on carbon emissions. Their Government spokespersons are putting  out messages such as that all of us have to change our habits and reduce our  carbon footprint if we are to save the environment. Their environment  Ministers, in particular, are reinforcing those messages.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As elected representatives, we have a responsibility. How  can we ask householders to cutback and to become more energy efficient if we do  not send out a strong message? How can we expect the big companies to fall into  line and to comply with their requirements? It is time for a serious approach  across all Departments, not just the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety. In a previous debate, I voiced the concerns of the Chief Medical  Officer. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development also has a huge  responsibility for forests and trees and the role that they can play in  mitigating the impact of climate change.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to consider the economic advantages of tackling  climate change and reducing emissions. Recently, a study on that topic was  carried out by Queen&rsquo;s University, which stated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;As the UK economy moves towards a low  carbon economy, Greenhouse Gas performance and efficiencies will become  increasingly important to regional competitiveness.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The study looked at the competitiveness of the four  countries of the UK  and found that the English economy was the most efficient and, therefore, the  most economically competitive. That link has been well established. Scotland was the next most efficient, followed  by Northern Ireland,  so we have room for improvement. The economic downturn presents an opportunity,  and other Governments have already availed themselves of that opportunity. The  potential of renewables from wind sources, the sun and crops such as biomass is  untapped.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The &ldquo;green new deal&rdquo; that was announced by the President of  the United States  brings an opportunity to put people back to work, as has already been mentioned  by the proposer of the motion. In recent months, our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland launched a scheme to make homes  across the entire country more energy efficient and created 200,000 jobs as  part of that initiative at a time when job losses are at such a serious level.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I am not giving way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The conclusions of the Queen&rsquo;s University study are worth  further consideration. The study states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;those regions that will be most competitive will be  those that are able to outperform other regions, in terms of a higher  production of goods and services per unit of GHG impacts.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It also states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In the not-so-distant future, the efficiency with  which GHG emissions are used will be a fundamentally important determinant of  competitiveness. Countries and regions with low GHG efficiencies may therefore  find themselves at a disadvantage.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Therefore, it is important for the Assembly to  adopt the motion as amended as a first step. I thank the House for its  consideration, and I ask Members to support the motion as amended.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  have the difficult job of following the expert dissertation in astrophysics  from the Member who just spoke. I am sure that, if they were alive today,  Galileo and Copernicus would be green with envy at his grasp of the subject. I  will make my remarks fairly quickly &mdash; not only because I have only five  minutes, but because I want to avoid the dangers of a moving sun hitting me. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am disappointed by the motion, but, given its source, I  am not particularly surprised. That is the level of &ldquo;stuntery&rdquo; that one would  expect from the Members who proposed it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is not about the commitment of the Executive to  carbon reduction and to combating climate change, because that is clear and  unchanged. The commitments and actions that are taken by various Departments  are clear-cut. Under my colleague Arlene Foster, the Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment has a group on sustainable energy. Work is going on  between all Departments, including the Department of the Environment (DOE), to  bring those commitments about. There is an issue over whether all Departments  are fully pulling their weight, but it is clear that the motion is not about  that.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nor, indeed, is the issue about trying to ban any advert.  Had the mover and co-signatory of the motion actually listened to what the  Minister said to the Committee, they would know that he stated clearly that not  only had he not banned the ad, he had not tried to ban it. The motion is,  therefore, not factually accurate on that basis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nor, indeed, is the motion about preserving energy or about  trying to prevent people knowing about energy efficiency. We already have the  Energy Saving Trust&rsquo;s adverts, which run alongside others.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the motion is motivated by the same stuntery  that we saw in the Committee when the motion of no confidence was proposed.  Indeed, its motivation comes from an ever-more-desperate Conservative grouping  that sits on other Benches. That group is more concerned about vote reduction  than about carbon reduction. It is less concerned about landslides in the  developing world than the landslide in East Antrim  in 2005. That is the real motivation behind the motion: it is a blatant attempt  at point-scoring. I will give it credit, however, for giving the Assembly the  opportunity to debate the issue that is truly behind the matter, which is the  right of the Assembly and the Executive to pursue campaigns on their own  accord.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fact is that the Minister &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Had  Members &mdash; particularly those who sit on the Committee &mdash; actually listened to  the Minister instead of wanting constantly to talk, they would have realised  that he sought a Northern Ireland campaign on the issue. He objected to only  one item in the advert and to the attempt by the Westminster Department  concerned to impose it on other parts of the United Kingdom. Wales and Scotland objected in exactly the  same way; indeed, they are pursuing their own campaigns.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On that issue &mdash; as well as on other devolved matters, such  as road safety &mdash; the Assembly is entitled to pursue its own campaign.  Road-safety campaigns do not happen simply by accident: they are tried and  tested, and indeed, market tested, in order to determine the most effective  message for Northern Ireland.  The fact is that there has been no opportunity to do so with regard to climate  change. Act on CO2 is simply an attempt to impose a one-size-fits-all approach  throughout the UK.  It was resisted by Wales and  Scotland, and indeed, no  similar campaign has been put in place in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: I appreciate that the Member has given way.  He will be pleased to note that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural  Affairs (DEFRA) has now started to swing round to my point of view. Such has  been the opposition in England  to the Act on CO2 brand that the ad now has to include the strapline that  includes the words &ldquo;save energy&rdquo;. That is my point: if a message is to be  effective, it must resonate with the public.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  agree absolutely with the Minister. As he made clear at the Committee meeting  in question, and as Members should know perfectly well, there has never been  any opposition to saving energy, nor has there ever been any opposition to the  Assembly putting forward its own message on the issue. As a devolved Assembly,  it should have the opportunity to do that. It is clear that the motion is  simply an attempt at stuntery. It has unearthed, however, one important issue,  which is the right of the Assembly to follow its own advertising campaigns.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I must say that I am surprised that on the one hand, the  SDLP and, presumably, Sinn F&eacute;in will support the motion and will, therefore,  want the Assembly to follow slavishly the exact line that has been taken in  England, while on the other, the Conservatives&rsquo; friends, UCUNF (Ulster  Conservatives and Unionists &mdash; New Force), on the Benches to my right, want the  Assembly to follow the exact words of new Labour.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is, therefore, no conviction whatever in either  stance. The dodgy science that was highlighted by the proposer of the  amendment, as well as his dodgy recollection of what happened in the Committee  on the particular day in question, shows that there is absolutely no conviction  behind the motion. It is simply an attempt to score points and to have a go at  the Minister of the Environment. I call on the Assembly to, rightly, reject  that stuntery and to concentrate on taking real and substantial action on  energy conservation and to ensure that climate change is tackled properly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I support the motion and the amendment. I welcome the  opportunity to speak in the debate. I also welcome the Minister to the Big  Brother House; this must be day 133. I am sure that he is wondering whether he  will be evicted. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When one reads the text of the advertisements that the  Minister of the Environment blocked from being aired in the North &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>: I  have only two and a half minutes to speak, Peter; have a wee seat to yourself  there. Sorry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When one reads the text of the advertisements that the  Minister of the Environment blocked from being aired in the North, one can see  that their major message is very relevant in the present economic downturn &#8213;  namely, save money, save energy. The Minister&rsquo;s reasoning for blocking them was  his self-proclaimed scepticism about the effects of global warming and climate  change, and mankind&rsquo;s contribution to it. However, we can clearly see that  those advertisements make little mention of the subject, other than to outline  that reducing energy reduces CO2 emissions, and a suggestion that the viewer or  listener searches online for information on Act on CO2 literature.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the Minister&rsquo;s unreasonable rationale for  blocking those advertisements is bogus. The Minister is perfectly entitled to  his personal views on global warming and climate change, but the public  perception is that the Minister&rsquo;s personal view is contrary to that of his  Ministry. It should not be even a matter for debate whether the Minister can  order his Department to hold his views &mdash; he cannot. The Minister must be aware  that with his title comes responsibility and leadership &#8213; responsibility to  listen to the voices of the vast majority of people in the North, in Europe and, indeed, the world.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Global warming is a major concern for the planet. People  want to do something &mdash; no matter how small &mdash; to try to counteract it. The  Minister should not discourage such actions simply because he does not believe  that small actions make any difference. His job is to encourage and to inform.  However, by blocking those advertisements, he has done none of the  aforementioned, and, instead, has brought derision and ridicule on his  Department and on the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If he is not prepared to carry out his role responsibly, I  must support the call for the Executive to launch a cross-departmental campaign  to address climate change and relieve the Minister of the burden that he so  obviously has no wish to carry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive must be prepared to listen to, and I quote  Joan Ruddock:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the best science, the most up-to-date information and  the evidence&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">in order to ensure that we meet the targets that  are set out in the Programme for Government. Either that, or else if the DUP  Ministers on the Executive rally round their sceptical colleague and refuse to  play their part, we can assume that the line from &lsquo;The Sunday Times&rsquo; on 15  February &mdash; and I have learned the tactic of using the Sunday newspapers as a  source of reference from the DUP &mdash; would seem to be a claim well-founded when  it stated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Power has gone to their heads, and some senior DUP  members, including Wilson  seem to be revelling in their new-found notoriety.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I apologise to Peter Weir; I spoke for three minutes and 15  seconds. I support the motion and the amendment. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: My  colleagues and I will support the motion as amended because of the words that  appear on the Order Paper, not because of any oratory powers or scientific  persuasion from the Members who proposed the motion or those who tabled the  amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It seems to me, as Stephen Farry made the point during a  debate this morning, that there is something rather ridiculous in the fact that  Members who had nothing to say during the debate on the draft Renewables  Obligation Order can devote time to this sort of private Member&rsquo;s motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  This place&rsquo;s name is supposed to refer to its status as a legislative Assembly,  not as a debating society. It is sad that more Members are in the House at this  stage to take part in a debating society than were present when serious  legislation was being discussed by a Minister from the DUP Benches who seems to  have a greater understanding of the issues than her successor as the Minister  of the Environment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I thank the Member for giving way. Mr McClarty talked  about the importance of renewable energy to the economy, and so on. However,  when the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment was in the Chamber, Mr  McClarty &mdash; and I think he was present &mdash; did not have a word to say about the  matter. Perhaps no one had written a script for him on that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  would not want to be too embarrassed by agreeing too much with the Minister, so  I will leave that issue hanging.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It seems that the Minister&rsquo;s performance during his time in  office has amounted to a continual statement that he does what he is obliged to  do. Indeed, he probably does. I do not believe that he could ever be got under  the ministerial code for not doing what he is obliged to do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The problem is that a Minister who does the minimum that he  is obliged to do, and then speaks against the spirit of the Programme for  Government&rsquo;s undertakings to reduce CO2 emissions, does not seem to be  providing the leadership that we are entitled to. That is my major concern with  the way in which he is carrying out his actions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Senator Pat Moynihan might have said, Sammy Wilson is  entitled to his opinions but he is not entitled to his own facts. The facts, as  understood by the overwhelming majority of opinion, are quite clear. I hope  that when the Minister responds to the debate he will remember to give me the  figure that he could not provide in the Environment Committee &mdash; it was how much  CO2 I have saved by using my Translink SmartPass throughout this year, compared  to the emissions that I might have caused had I been using a car.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I am sure that the Member is dying to hear what his carbon  footprint is. According to the number of miles for which the Member claimed  travel expenses last year, he generated 1&middot;4 tons of carbon. That is  considerably less than other Committee members; however, had he used his  SmartPass continuously, he could have reduced that amount by 75% to 0&middot;36 tons.  He still has a long way to go.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  note that the Minister is not capable of answering the question that I asked  him, which was how much I had saved, but he got his cheap jag in anyway.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue was raised about whether DECC was attempting to  impose its particular set of English advertisements on Scotland, Wales  and Northern Ireland.  The Minister told us that the Scots, and now the Welsh, have rejected the DECC  advertisements and are doing their own thing. However, that is the fundamental  difference between the Scots, the Welsh, and this Minister &mdash; as yet we have  seen no advertising campaign from the DOE on the matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It may well be that simply concentrating on switching off  the standby button was not of a high enough standard for Sammy Wilson to allow  his Department to approve the advertisement. The question then is this: if he  is going to maintain that argument, what advertisements will we see? That is  why it is vital that we see real action across the entire Executive, and not just  on an advertising campaign. Climate change is a cross-departmental issue, yet  it seems to be going unrecognised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If we are going to deal seriously with climate change, it  must be looked at by the entire Executive. Different Departments have  responsibilities, whether it is for energy efficiency, renewable energy &mdash; as we  discussed earlier &mdash; the warm homes scheme, or for greater incentives to use  public transport. All those are vital necessities, and they require action  across the entire range of Executive Departments. This does not merely involve  the question of whether a particular form of advertisement is shown.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier this morning, the Minister for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, when debating the draft Renewables Obligations Order (Northern Ireland)  2009, sought to defend the approach of the Executive and spoke about various  things that were happening on a cross-departmental basis. However, it seems to  me that those actions are extremely thin on the ground. There may be  discussions among Ministers and small groups of officials, but virtually  nothing is being rolled out &mdash; at a time when initiatives on the green economy  are being flagged up by President Obama in particular, and when action is  taking place in other parts of the UK  and in other countries in Europe. There is  nothing to show that there is real, consistent, coherent action taking place  here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have heard about the difficulties in getting renewable  energy from wind power under way under PPS 18. There is a range of things not  being carried through across the entire range of Executive responsibilities. If  the Minister is going to tell us that he is refusing to have the actions of the  DECC imposed on him, but that he is doing better himself, it seems to me that  he and his colleagues have a great deal of explaining to do.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  agree with Mr Boylan on one point: environmental issues have been a hot topic  in the Chamber since the current Environment Minister took up his post. We have  seen a positive debate resulting, both in the Chamber and among the public,  about how we should address climate change, the causes of climate change, how  the Government should implement policy, and how we should affect our individual  lifestyles. We should all thank the Minister for ensuring that we have that  debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is unfortunate that some people over the past number of  weeks, and in the Chamber today, have chosen to say that the Minister has  banned the advertisement from our TV screens.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has not banned the advertisement; indeed, I  saw it last night while I was reading up for this debate. He has exercised his  constitutional right to decide on how to promote devolved matters. That is  fundamental to the meaning of devolution. It means that on devolved issues such  as the environment and climate change, Northern Ireland Ministers must be  able to decide for themselves how to promote Government policy. The Minister&rsquo;s  decision is an important constitutional marker; those in the Chamber who  lambasted various direct rule Ministers over the years should be glad that  local Ministers are now able to call the shots.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Act on CO2 campaign did not seek the views of the Northern  Ireland Executive, or, indeed, the people of Northern Ireland. It is, in effect,  an England-only strategy. For those who repeatedly, and often quite rightly,  say that we cannot simply transplant GB legislation or strategies into Northern Ireland,  this is a clear example of just that. I would like to think that, if the  Executive are to promote any message, they would carry out their own research  and opinion polling in Northern    Ireland rather than rely on data from  elsewhere. Indeed, as Mr Weir said, the devolved institutions in Scotland and Wales chose not to run with the Act  on CO2 advertisements. The Scottish version did not carry the Act on CO2 logo,  because it, along with the advertisement&rsquo;s strapline, is an England-only logo.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have talked about the Department for Social  Development&rsquo;s energy-saving message, through which I am aware that the power to  save energy is at my fingertips. That Department does not use the Act on CO2  logo; perhaps the SDLP Members should talk to their Minister about that issue  if they feel strongly about it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The role of the Executive is important; the motion and the  amendment ignore the fact that the Executive are collectively responsible for  promoting the Programme for Government targets on emissions. The Minister of  the Environment&rsquo;s decision not to use the Act on CO2 advertisements does not  mean that the core message will not be heard. For example, DSD promotes  household energy efficiency in conjunction with the Energy Saving Trust, and  its advertisements appear on our television screens all the time. The  Department for Regional Development has a role in encouraging more of us to  leave our cars at home and use public transport. Mr Weir mentioned the role of  the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the sustainable energy  group that was set up by Arlene Foster.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The decision not to use the Act on CO2 strategy does not  mean that we will miss our targets. It would be naive to promote that argument,  because to do so is to say that one advertisement alone will make a difference.  Such an argument makes assumptions about the views of the Northern Ireland  public and what it will or will not buy into. Without any local research being  done, that is a poor state of affairs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The recent debate over here on climate change has demonstrated  that the general public have diverse views on the issue. Mr Boylan mentioned  the Big Brother house; the numbers of people who have contacted the Minister in  the constituency office that I share with him in Larne, and in his ministerial  office, demonstrate that the vast majority of the public support his views and  support the fact that we are having a real debate on the issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to return to a point that was made by Mr Ford and by  the Minister. Tommy Gallagher and David McClarty talked about the importance of  renewables, but it was significant that no one from their parties spoke in the  preceding debate on the motion proposed by the Minister of Enterprise, Trade  and Investment. That is telling, and it shows us the real motivation of those two  parties in this debate. The Assembly&rsquo;s time would be better spent on promoting  the message of energy conservation and on real environmentalism, rather than  trying to score cheap political points. For those reasons, I oppose the motion  and the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I wish to speak in favour of the  motion and the amendment. It is quite clear that the Committee for the  Environment has no confidence in the Minister; nor do the environmental lobby,  university students in Belfast  or many of his party colleagues have any confidence. However, an eccentric  children&rsquo;s TV presenter who has not been seen for 20 years supports the  Minister, as well as one or two people in Larne, by the sound of it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Programme for Government clearly states that action is  needed to reduce our impact on climate change. The DUP signed up to that and to  tackling the impact that human activity has on climate change. Why, then, did  the DUP appoint someone &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  The Member is insinuating that the DUP has signed up to all of that, as if Sinn  F&eacute;in is some sort of wonderful party. I omitted to write to the Minister about  a matter that he raised during a meeting of the Committee for the Environment  in the Senate Chamber in connection with a person who had been involved in  environmental crime. The Member had written to the Minister to try to get that  person cleared of that environmental crime.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I am curious to know how Mr McKay can stand here  today and claim to be the panacea for everything to do with environmental  issues, and yet, in another instance, he wrote to the Minister to try to assist  someone who caused an environmental crime to get off.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: I  thank the Member for his contribution. I ask him to recheck his facts and,  indeed, to reread the letter, if he has actually seen it. In that letter, I  clearly state that the environmental laws need to be upheld. However, I oppose  the way in which the procedures were carried out and the fact that they were  not carried out quickly enough in that instance. The Member should check his  facts.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: I  will not give way again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Why did the DUP appoint to that Ministry someone who consistently  makes a mockery of the party? Sammy says that the rest of the DUP is wrong,  because the party&rsquo;s manifesto says that it believes that human activity  influences climate change. Not only is he giving a two-finger salute to the  environmental lobby, he is giving the two-finger salute to his own party. Where  is the party&rsquo;s Whip in all of this? When is he going to take account of public  opinion and evict Sammy from the DUP Front Bench?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive are committed to reducing greenhouse gas  emissions by 25% on 1990 levels by the year 2025. Greenhouse gas emissions have  already decreased by 6%, which is welcome. However, much more needs to be done.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also support the amendment. The issue of climate change  needs to be mainstreamed across different Departments, in particular the  Department for Social Development and the Department for Regional Development,  because they, too, have responsibilities. As Tommy Gallagher outlined, there  are many opportunities for job creation, particularly in the field of renewable  energy. The Executive should look at that issue in a more joined-up way. It is  imperative, therefore, that we act on CO2 emissions, that Ministers adhere to  the Programme for Government and that they address the issue of climate change  on a cross-departmental basis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, at 12.30 pm, the Assembly all-party working group on  climate change will meet a representative of the Met Office who will outline  the dangers that weather-pattern changes pose to this society and others. The  Minister is welcome to join us, if he wants to learn something.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I am sure that it will not be a shock to the proposers of the motion or the  amendment that I do not support either of them. As some of my colleagues have  said, this is nothing more than political &ldquo;stuntery&rdquo;. I do not believe that &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  If the Member holds on, I will give way in a minute; I have only just started.  As my colleague pointed out, Mr McClarty has already had 10 minutes to speak,  and much of his contribution was not on the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister was right not to support the advertisement.  The Assembly and the Executive, as a whole, have a responsibility to deal with  the issue of climate change. As other Members said, the Minister for Social  Development has a responsibility to tackle the issue and is doing so. The  Minister of the Environment made the right decision to use his discretion not  to fund the advert.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I accept that climate change is a reality; it has  been a feature of the history, dating back hundreds of years, of our planet.  Perhaps climate change is not a phenomenon, as others might suggest. Some  scientists believe that there was an ice age; so what happened to the ice if  climate change did not cause it to melt? Low and behold, we are now told that  climate change may be the result of industrialisation, cars, aeroplanes and  other types of energy use. If that were the case, what brought about climate  change before the industrial revolution? The Minister&rsquo;s views are clear &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: I  find the Member&rsquo;s comments quite strange, because his father was a consistent  supporter of the passage of the Climate Change Act 2008 at Westminster. Does the Member agree with the  Environment Minister&rsquo;s opinion that human activity does not contribute to  climate change, despite the fact that DUP party policy clearly states that  human activity does contribute to climate change?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I will respond first and then I will give way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have no difficulty in supporting the view of my party,  and I believe that the Minister has been right to open up the debate.  Scientists are now disagreeing with one another on the issue, so no one should  be concerned about having different opinions. The Minister has opened up the  debate, and people should have a right to express their opinion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  At the beginning of his speech, the Member mentioned that the motion was  nothing but &ldquo;political stuntery&rdquo; &mdash; his words, not mine. If the motion is  &ldquo;political stuntery&rdquo;, why did his party think it necessary to table a petition  of concern?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  The fact that I said the motion was political stuntery should be evidence  enough. The Minister&rsquo;s views about the human impact on climate change are  clear.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  The Member mentioned the human impact, and David McKay talked about human  activity. Does the Member agree that Mr McKay&rsquo;s human activity, as a member of  the Environment Committee, has not contributed much because he has the worst  attendance rate of all members on that Committee?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  The one benefit of Mr McKay&rsquo;s non-attendance is that his carbon footprint is  not as bad as that of some other Committee members. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> I did not say it was the only benefit. The Minister has been right to express &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I have given way enough &mdash; I need to finish off.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has been right to have the courage to express  his views on the matter &mdash; the fact that scientists are now starting to change  their minds is evidence of that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us look at some of the wider aspects of the issue. The  Ulster Unionist Party says that it is worried about climate change, but one  aspect of that concerns methane. As everyone knows, most methane comes from  farm animals. I take it that the Ulster Unionist Party, and those who support  the motion, support farmers being made redundant and animals being taken off  farms so that methane is no longer an issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As far as I am concerned, the motion is political stuntery  and I hope that the House comes to its senses and opposes it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The way that the debate has gone has been surprising. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Thank you. The Minister would probably be better going back to teaching than  being Minister of the Environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is bizarre that DUP Members have referred to the motion  as political stuntery when their party has tabled a petition of concern. Mr Ian  McCrea&rsquo;s rebuttal of that assertion was less than convincing. DUP Members have  used the words &ldquo;political stuntery&rdquo; throughout the debate, but the fact that  they stand by the petition of concern that their party tabled is in itself a  political stunt.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party is very supportive of  cross-cutting Government measures, and we accept that many parts of Government  need to be involved in the climate-change debate. However, the lead on the  issue should come from the Department of the Environment and be headed by the  Minister.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Well, why not?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  The Member said that the lead should come from the Department of the  Environment. Is that why his party took one of its Members &mdash; who used to drive  a three-litre, six-cylinder Jaguar &mdash; off the Environment Committee?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am glad that the Member has such details on what we all drive. I assume that  he is talking about Mr Gardiner. Mr Gardiner was moved to the Health Committee;  that was simply as a result of parties changing Committee memberships. It is no  big deal. The DUP moved Alistair Ross to the Committee for Regional  Development. Lots of Committee members move &mdash; what is the issue there?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Act on CO2 campaign provided an excellent opportunity  for individuals, families, businesses and the Executive to reduce Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  carbon emissions and to save money. The Department of Energy and Climate Change  was willing to pay for the campaign. Essentially, the Minister of the  Environment turned down, on Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s behalf, a free opportunity to help  us to reach targets that are set out in the Programme for Government, and to  save money. That is a disgrace.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To quote one of Mr Wilson&rsquo;s statements:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I think in 20 years&rsquo; time we will look back at this  whole climate change debate and ask ourselves how on earth we were ever conned  into spending the billions of pounds which are going into this without any kind  of rigorous examination of the background, the science, the implications of it  all.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If Mr Wilson is speaking on behalf of Northern Ireland,  as Minister of the Environment, it is prudent to examine the evidence on which  he bases his opinions and his own &ldquo;rigorous examination&rdquo; of the evidence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wilson has, on occasion, referred to, and it now appears  that he has based his opinions on, a report of 500 scientists that documents  doubts about man-made global warming. What Minister Wilson was more reluctant  to tell us was that that report was authored by Joseph Bast and James M Taylor  of the Heartland Institute in America.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, I should point out that Joseph Bast is an economist,  and James Taylor is a lawyer: neither of them is a scientist. Secondly, it  should be noted that the Heartland Institute is funded by Exxon Mobil, one of  the world&rsquo;s leading oil companies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Professor James McCarthy, of Harvard University,  in his evidence to the US Congress, stated of Exxon-funded ideological advocacy  groups, of which the Heartland Institute is one:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;These groups promote spokespeople who misrepresent  peer-reviewed scientific findings or cherry-pick facts in an attempt top  mislead the media and public into thinking there is vigorous debate in the  mainstream scientific community about climate change.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Well, briefly: I do not have much time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Given that the Member is so convinced of climate change, and his acceptance  that cows, for example, are one of the highest producers of methane, will he  give an assurance to the Assembly today that he is going to dispose of all his  cows and plant trees on his farm?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  When I started to speak, I wanted to take on some of the points that we need to  look at collectively across Government: it is about how we use &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Is he suggesting that he is going to get  rid of his livestock? Is he going to get rid of his car, his jeep? Does he not  drive a jeep with a three-litre engine as well? Did I not see a green &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I remind Members to address all remarks through the Chair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Mr Deputy Speaker, the Member would do well to look at his own lifestyle, as he  drives a huge Isuzu Trooper Jeep, and is, of course, a livestock farmer as  well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to look at how we can use technology to harness  that methane, and work with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development  and other Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is good to see that the First Minister has appeared to  back up his embattled Minister of the Environment before people try to evict  him from the House. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> It is interesting  to note that the DUP has not let &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  It is interesting that DUP Members have not let their colleague Jim Wells in  here today to speak. I support the motion and the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I support the motion and the amend&shy;ment, but feel that we should go much  further. The Minister&rsquo;s response to the advertising campaign is totally  unacceptable. It undermines the UK Government&rsquo;s policy on climate change and  the Executive&rsquo;s Programme for Government. The Minister is responsible for  implementing the Climate Change Act 2008, but says that he does not believe in  man-made climate change.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is difficult to see how he can implement such a policy  if he does not believe in it. His views are incompatible with the role of  Minister of the Environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Instead of quoting dodgy scientists, who are sponsored by  oil companies with an obvious vested interest in having people use more energy,  I appeal to the Minister to attend the meeting of the all-party working group  on climate change at 12.30 pm. If he were to go, he would hear from the  distinguished scientist Alex Hill, the chief adviser to the Government from the  Met Office in London  &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  note that the invitation to that meeting says that climate change &ldquo;may&rdquo; be  affected. How things &ldquo;may&rdquo; pan out is what we are discussing; no one is  definitive on this subject.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  If Members were to attend the meeting, they would find out about the effects of  climate change.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Will the Member give way on that point?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  If the Minister were to go to the meeting &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Unfortunately, I will be unable to attend that meeting,  and that is a great cause of concern to me. Given that the Member will be  there, perhaps he will ask the representative from the Met Office how often the  Hadley Centre has got its predictions wrong &mdash; I do not just mean its long-term  predictions, but even its short-term predictions. Indeed, he might ask about  the centre&rsquo;s weather predictions for this winter &mdash; I believe that it predicted  that we would have one of the warmest winters on record.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I will take those points on board. However, the overall argument on climate  change has been won; the science proves it, and it is time that the Minister actually  listened to what is being said.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s decision also raises serious questions about  censorship and about whether he has the right to deny Northern Ireland  viewers the opportunity to see the adverts that promote energy conservation.  Given escalating energy bills and the level of fuel poverty that exists, any  advice on energy conservation would be extremely useful to the people of Northern Ireland.  Therefore, to turn down free adverts that promote energy conservation is &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  No, I am sorry; I have a great deal to get through.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I first heard the Minister&rsquo;s comments, I issued a  press statement &mdash; as I do regularly whenever he comments on climate change &mdash;  condemning his decision. The response to my routine press statement was  significant. Within 10 minutes of issuing the statement, my phone was red hot  with calls from journalists throughout the islands and Europe  who were asking for interviews on the subject. I got calls from the BBC News  Channel, BBC Radio Foyle, &lsquo;Stormont Live&rsquo;, RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s &lsquo;Newstalk&rsquo;, UTV, Channel 4,  Citybeat, &lsquo;Drivetime&rsquo; on Radio Scotland,  Downtown Radio &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  No, I am sorry; I have a limited amount of time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There was such a response from throughout the UK because the  media could not believe that an Environment Minister does not believe in  climate change. That morning, I did eight TV interviews, and I did a similar  number of radio broadcasts during the day. Further afield, the issue was picked  up by newspapers in Australia  and Canada.  Why was there all that interest? A Minister of the Environment who does not  believe in climate change is a major &mdash; and unique &mdash; news story throughout Europe and the world. Unfortunately, the story reinforces  the view of many UK  listeners that Northern    Ireland people still live in the Dark Ages.  The Minister certainly raised Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s profile.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, local public opinion &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is it permissible for a Member to  totally mislead the House by blandly stating that the Minister does not believe  in climate change? That is a totally misleading statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: First, the Minister will have an opportunity to respond to those  statements; and secondly, it is unparliamentary to accuse a Member of  misleading the House. Therefore, the Member should continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I wish to withdraw the word &ldquo;misleading&rdquo;. The situation, as I understand it, is  that the Minister does not consider man-made climate change &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Why has the Member  withdrawn something that he did not say? It was my colleague Dr William McCrea  who used the word &ldquo;misleading&rdquo;. When the Member gets it wrong, he should be  punished for it, but if he has not used the word &ldquo;misleading&rdquo;, he should not  have to withdraw it &mdash; he is confused.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I shall finish what I was saying.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We were overcome by public opinion. We set up a &ldquo;Fire Sammy  Wilson&rdquo; petition to which 2,290 people have contributed. We hope to hand that  petition over to the Department this afternoon. The Green Party feels that  Sammy Wilson&rsquo;s role as the Minister of the Environment is incompatible with his  views on climate change, and he should resign.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Many DUP Members listening to the debate feel that a modern witch-hunt is being  conducted against our colleague, the Minister of the Environment, Sammy Wilson  &mdash; a man who refuses to agree with everyone else when they are adamant that the  world is flat; a man who has his own opinion, which is an issue in itself.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I was a youngster, which was not yesterday &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: If,  as many of us believe, the debate is a witch-hunt on the Minister, I am sure  that the Members who are behind that witch-hunt would like the Minister to be  burnt at the stake in a carbon-neutral manner. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I hope that no Members wish to see him burnt at the stake, but that is just my  opinion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is, clearly, an issue about carbon emissions, which  concerns me, as a parent, because my boys come home and tell me about it. We  realise that there is an issue to be addressed, and the Minister has tried to  do that. He has attempted to show the people of the Province that things are  not as clear-cut as they appear. The fact is that opinions other than the  scientific one exist, and those should be publicly expressed and considered.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Member said that the Minister was trying to make the issue as clear-cut as  possible. Will he not agree that the Minister is actually confusing the issue,  because no one knows whether he believes that carbon emissions have any impact  on climate? It would be helpful if the Minister were to indicate whether he  accepts that increased CO2 emissions contribute something towards climate  change.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  The Minister will have a chance to respond to that in a few minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Does the Member not agree that it is more important that we work towards agreed  targets rather than agreed opinions?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Let me put it another way: let us work together towards the targets rather than  be confused by some of the issues that people have raised here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will give an example of the misuse of figures &mdash; and  Members who represent fishing communities will understand that the scientific  angle is not always right &mdash; that relates to the Irish Sea.  Fishermen are prevented from landing fish that they see in their boats and on  the radar but which scientists say are not there. The real reason for that is  to allow fishermen from Spain,  Portugal  and perhaps other European countries to catch the fish that scientists say are  not there. Scientists are saying something contrary to what the fishermen are  saying. That is fact, not fiction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A simple search on the Internet of the Committee on Climate  Change website shows that Northern Ireland is responsible for only 3&middot;4% of UK  carbon emissions, while England is responsible for some 77&middot;1%. Even taking into  account the size difference of land mass, if Northern   Ireland equalled the size of England, with our current output,  we would emit almost 28% less, which easily beats any targets that have been  set. Those are facts. We are not being complacent; we are being realistic. In a  global context, Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s output is less than 1%, which  means it comes last on a table of countries&rsquo; carbon emissions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am very conscious of the time, but I want to make a  couple of other comments. Most importantly, why should our devolved Government  be forced to advertise party-political issues on behalf of the Labour Party? I  was not aware that devolved Governments were subject to party-political  pressure that transcended the constitutional powers that were devolved to them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Oor Meinstar isnae afeert o&rsquo; shakin things up &ndash; yin oanly  needs tae see tha DOE adverts fer speedin&rsquo; an satebelts tae unnerstuan that  whun a herd lien haes tae be tuk &ndash; it wull be tuk. Hooinever, why shud we be  pit doon tae shooderin a&rsquo; load whuch isnae oors tae shooder.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our Minister is not afraid to shake things up. One need  only see the DOE adverts about speeding and the wearing of seat belts to  understand that he takes a hard line when necessary. Why, however, should  people be subjected to shouldering a burden that is not entirely theirs to  shoulder?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our Minister is an educated man with a clear point of view.  He is entitled to ensure that a balanced perspective is presented to the people  of the Province. As I and other Members highlighted, the burden is not ours  alone to shoulder. Money would be better spent on action that makes a  difference to the people of the Province than on advertising.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am a supporter of devolution, as I hope are all Members.  As such, I cannot support a motion that seeks party-political decisions in the  manner of direct rule. I oppose the motion and the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: It is good that, once again, the House is  having its usual intellectual debate on such issues. I assure the Member for  South Down, Newry and Armagh, or wherever &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am a Member for South Down.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I assure the Member for South Down that I feel in no way  embattled today, nor have I ever felt embattled on the issue. I will never feel  under pressure from the toy soldiers of the &ldquo;new force&rdquo; &mdash;or the new farce &mdash; who  sit in that corner of the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that a petition of concern will be presented this  afternoon. However, I wish to make it clear that, since I raised the issue, my  Department has received nearly 400 pieces of correspondence. Those people took  the time to sit down and write letters, as opposed to sticking their names on  the bottom of a petition. Of those 400 correspondents, some 80% support my  stance. In a poll carried out by UTV, over 80% of the 3,000 people who took  part support my stance. I have received approximately 900 letters on the  subject at my constituency office, about 85% of which support me. I do not,  therefore, feel embattled. The issue continues to require debate, and I am glad  to have been able to stimulate it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate has been one of contradictions. Anyone can count  the number of 4x4s in the Assembly car park. When I did so on my way into the  Building this morning, there were 10 &mdash; and I admit that one of them is mine.  All 10 vehicles have engine sizes of 2&middot;5 litres or more. Most of the cars in  the car park have engines of over two litres. They probably belong to Members  sitting on the Benches and giving lectures on acting &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Some belong to Members from the Minister&rsquo;s party.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Yes; I acknowledge that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members are lecturing the Assembly on CO2 emissions.  Is it any wonder that the public get sick and tired of being lectured to about  the restrictions that they must bear? The Member for Lagan Valley  highlighted the contradiction when he made an intervention during the Member  for South Down&rsquo;s speech.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members protest and complain about how every action  taken on CO2 emissions has an impact on their constituents. At some point in  the debate, I hope to have an opportunity to illustrate that further  contradiction with quotes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The ultimate contradiction, as was pointed out, is that  nationalist parties tell me that, rather than the Assembly&rsquo;s imprint being on  any action to save energy, we should simply follow, poodle-like, the example of  DEFRA at Westminster. That is despite DEFRA having made it clear to me, the  Scottish and Welsh Ministers, and the EU that it wishes to pursue an  England-only campaign.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate did not start too well when the Member for East  Londonderry Mr McClarty quoted one of the presidential hopefuls in the American  elections; to begin a speech with a quote from a loser is not a great start to  any speech. However, a party of losers will always want to quote losers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us look at some of the things that the Member said.  First, he said that my stance makes people in Northern Ireland look like  dangerous radicals &mdash; he probably meant to say dangerous nutcases. I will read some  of the quotes that have appeared in the newspapers this week from people who  are on Mr McClarty&rsquo;s side, and perhaps some Members on that side should do some  reading on the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In &lsquo;The Times&rsquo; this morning, Gordon Brown&rsquo;s leading green  adviser&rsquo;s solution to the dilemma that we face with climate change is to cut  the UK population by 30 million. Who is the nutcase? I know that my party has  proposed that the Assembly should be cut in half, but we do not mean that  Members should be eradicated &mdash; we simply mean that we should get them out of  this place to save a bit of money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A book by James Lovelock was serialised in &lsquo;The Sunday  Times&rsquo;. I bought the book because I thought that the newspaper quoted him  wrongly, as he went even further and said that the things that have to be done  to solve the problem are so radical that we might have to suspend democracy.  Again, who is the nutcase?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Professor James Hansen recently gave evidence to the public  inquiry into the Kingsnorth coal-fired power station, and he compared it to the  gas chambers. He compared the trains that brought the coal to the cattle trucks  that brought people to the gas chambers at Auschwitz.  That is the kind of nonsense that we are hearing from some people who are  allied to Mr McClarty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McClarty went on to talk about the importance of  messages on energy saving. I have no difficulty with such messages. Indeed, the  Executive put out messages on energy saving. My Department is not actually  responsible for that &mdash; it is the responsibility of the Department for Social  Development. Perhaps SDLP Members could take the matter up with their Minister,  because the Energy Saving Trust deliberately decided not to sign up to the Act  on CO2 advertisements and went down the route of commissioning its own  advertisement. I do not know how much that cost. Sinn F&eacute;in is also getting  precious about the issue, but the Department for Regional Development also decided  not to sign up to the Act on CO2 advertisements, and it put out its own energy  saving messages.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Given that the Minister has referred to two Departments so far, have the  Ministers of those Departments ever raised their concerns or opposition to his  actions?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: No, they have not raised their concerns, even though I  wrote to them. The Scottish and Welsh Ministers have said that there is a need  to tailor messages to a local population, and decisions were made to not use  the DEFRA campaign. Indeed, I made an offer to the Minister of the Department  of Energy and Climate Change that we could examine a UK-wide energy saving  advertise&shy;ment, which could be used by all Administrations. That was six months  ago, but I have yet to hear from him. Therefore, let us not get the idea that I  want to waste energy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The energy conservation messages are going out. However, it  is not just me who has decided not to us the Act on CO2 line &mdash; other  Departments have also decided not to use it. As I pointed out in an earlier  intervention, DEFRA is beginning to realise that there is a kickback, and it is  realising that my view that energy saving should be emphasised, rather than  acting on CO2, is a much more effective way of getting the message across.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  In light of the information about those two Departments, which are represented  by the very people who are trying to take action against the Minister, is it  not really proof that the motion is nothing more than a stunt?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: We all know that it is a stunt, but I do not mind. They  can engage in stunts if they wish; I think that the public will understand that  also.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McClarty also waxed eloquently &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>: He  did not.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Well, perhaps he did not wax eloquently, but he spoke  about my view of the impact of the renewables obligation, and the benefits that  we might receive from that. However, as has been pointed out, he sat through  this morning&rsquo;s debate on that issue and did not have a word to say about it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I cannot miss out Mr Gallagher, who is, of course,  very concerned about this matter. He moved the motion of no confidence in the  Environment Committee, and when I visited the Committee, he did not attend.  Perhaps that shows just how concerned he was. He had the opportunity; I was at  the Committee for two-and-a-half hours and he could have questioned me at  length and given me the benefit of his scientific views. However, I do not  believe that scientific views that are based in the pre-Galilean era are of  much use in discussing this issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Galileo &mdash; and perhaps I should tell Mr Gallagher this &mdash;  discovered that the earth actually revolves around the sun; not that the sun  revolves round the earth. The sun does not move closer to the earth. Mr  Gallagher told me that I had ignored the science. I would love to know &mdash; and I  will give way to him &mdash; whether he can tell me one scientist whose work on this  issue he has read &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Go ahead, Tommy. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Well, I think that he is getting the message. I would give  him his chance, but I do not have much time left. At least, before I stand up  and make a decision or give an opinion, I do the House the favour of reading up  on an issue. I would be happy to engage with Mr Gallagher on some of the  scientific evidence that I have looked at on this issue. Perhaps, at some  stage, he might like to debate that and invite me along to the Committee to  give my views.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Had Mr Gallagher been at the Committee when I visited, I  would have had the opportunity to tell him how he has acted on CO2, because Mr  Gallagher has become known as the Christopher Columbus from Fermanagh.  According to his mileage claim for last year, he has twice circumnavigated the  world in pursuit of his Assembly duties. It is a wonder that he has any time to  come here; he must spend most of his time in the car. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During that time, he has generated more than 20 tons of  carbon; he is the carbon king of this Assembly. There is a perfectly good  express bus from Enniskillen to Belfast,  and I will give him the timetable for it, if he wants it. Had he used that bus  and acted on C02, he would have generated only 6&middot;84 tons of carbon and could  have reduced his carbon footprint by 60%. Did he do it? Not on your life,  because acting on CO2 is for someone else, not for Mr Gallagher.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I thank the Minister for giving way. I know that he does not visit the west  very often and may not know the geography very well, but I do not live in  Enniskillen. In fact, for me to drive to Enniskillen to get the express bus  that he referred to would take 45 minutes. I think that the Minister might do  better by finding out exactly where I live and what the implications are for  travel before making such a song and dance about it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: That is why the Member&rsquo;s party has encouraged people to  use park-and-ride facilities. With those facilities, one drives to the station,  parks one&rsquo;s vehicle and then rides on public transport. Perhaps the Member has  not heard of park-and-ride.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are alternatives. Mr Gallagher has talked about acting  on CO2, but he has not shown any evidence that he is prepared to act in that  way himself.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford, who is not in his place, said that I had done all  that I am obliged to do. I have done that, and I will continue to do so.  However, he said that I had not shown leadership on the issue and that I had  not got into the spirit of it. I have looked at his record &mdash; he may say the  right words, but look at his actions. Mr Ford welcomed the launch of Aer Lingus  flights from Belfast International Airport,  which was a good catch for the South Antrim  constituency.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Minister draw his remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I have one minute.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford welcomed that. Aeroplanes generate CO2, but he  realised that his constituents would benefit.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Minister&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I would have loved to have had time to go through the  comments that other Members made. The one thing that I will say is that this  decision was made on the basis that, first, I wanted to ensure that the  Northern Ireland Assembly had its place; secondly, I wanted to ensure that we  had an effective message; and, thirdly, I did not want to use propaganda put  out by DEFRA in England.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I realise that I have five  minutes, so I will be as concise as possible. Mr McClarty said that the  Minister is at variance with the Department, the public and the stance that has  been enunciated publicly by the Executive. He also mentioned the planet Exxon.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Mr Gallagher mentioned the incompatibility of  the Minister&rsquo;s views with the Programme for Government. He also spoke about the  Queen&rsquo;s University study on the efficiency of outputs and contribution to  greenhouse gases.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened raptly to Mr Weir&rsquo;s contribution. He is not in  the Chamber now, but there was a common thread in the contributions from the  DUP Benches. He used examples of every other Department&rsquo;s ability to meet the  targets relating to greenhouse gases and the protection of the environment. He  showed how it is done, but wanted us not to look at his Minister and what he  has not done, or, in fact, what he has said.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Boylan referred to the lack of leadership and example  that is being shown by the Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford referred to the need for a cross-departmental  approach to the renewables issue &mdash; the warm homes scheme, public transport,  etc.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McKay mentioned the Environment Committee&rsquo;s vote of no  confidence in the Minister. I was at that Committee meeting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ian McCrea said that the Minister was right not to support  the advertisements, and he drew attention to my colleague Margaret Ritchie,  who, I am glad to say, showed leadership in this area and showed the way  forward. I am glad to see that, in highlighting that, the Member was,  inadvertently, complimenting her for her leadership and for the example that  she showed in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  I do not have time to give way, because this is the winding-up speech on the  amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We then came to the Minister. I saw students in the Gallery  during the debate, and I wondered what they were learning from it. Mention was  made of contradictions relating to car parking; the American election; party  politics; Gordon Brown&rsquo;s adviser; the suspension of democracy; gas chambers;  Galileo; stunts; and Christopher Columbus. The Minister dealt with anything  except the real issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The real issue should be read into the record. It was  interesting that the Minister did not even show up for the hour-and-a-half  debate on earth hour. His colleague Minister Dodds responded on the matter. His  other colleague &mdash; Mr Wells, the &ldquo;Mr Green&rdquo; of the DUP &mdash; is absent today. It is  important that the reasons why action on climate change is urgent are read into  the record.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Successive reports of the UN intergovernmental panel on  climate change, the most recent of which involved over 3,800 scientists from  over 150 countries, have put the reality of human-induced climate change beyond  any doubt. Evidence indicates that cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions are  needed to keep the global average temperature rise below 2&deg;C above  pre-industrial levels. If that is not attended to, it could have the following  implications: in Africa, potentially, between 350 million and 600 million  people will suffer water shortages; in Asia, up to one billion people will suffer  water shortages, as supplies dwindle; in Australia and New Zealand, there will  be between 3,000 and 5,000 more heat-related deaths a year. That is the reality  of what we face. Furthermore, in Latin America,  up to 77 million people will face water shortages.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not here to get sucked into the mire, the morass and,  indeed, the mists of flippancy that have been bounced about here today. That is  the reality of climate change; that is why the SDLP tabled its amendment to the  motion. I am glad &mdash; indeed, honoured &mdash; to have been associated with the  amendment that Mr Gallagher has crafted and brought before the Assembly today.  I welcome the support from other Members for that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister must set aside the flippancy and treat a  ministry with responsibility for the environment as exactly that. We must deal  with the world realities that we face; this is not a narrow, sectional,  party-political or, indeed, parochial issue. I acknowledge that the Minister  received 400 letters of support &mdash; it is great to have a fan club.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  However, this issue is much more important than having a fan club. I ask  Members to please support the amendment. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  ask Members to read the motion carefully. It indicates the concern about the  attempt to restrict the viewing of the Act on CO2 message in Northern Ireland  and the failure to fulfil Programme for Government requirements. Therefore, the  motion is not a stunt; it addresses some very serious issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A petition of concern was presented, and it would appear  that every member of the DUP has signed that, other than the Minister of the  Environment, who may have signed it and then had his signature scored out. I am  not quite sure what happened, but the evidence given to me indicates that every  member of the DUP signed the petition of concern, which was intended to block  the vote on the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members, including David McClarty, Tommy  Gallagher and Daith&iacute; McKay, have highlighted how the Minister&rsquo;s position is  contrary to the targets set out in the Programme for Government, and that is  also stated in the motion. There are very specific references in the Programme  for Government that one cannot dance around. For example, it states that we  will:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;play our part in addressing this challenge by  reducing our impact on climate change.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If it is the case that we can have an impact by adding to  climate change, the opposite is also true: that is, we can have an impact on  reducing climate change. The Programme for Government accepts that we are  having an impact on climate change and that it is possible to take actions to  minimise that. That document also mentions our &ldquo;carbon footprint&rdquo;. Therefore,  in attempting to ban the Act on CO2 advertisements because of his personal  beliefs, the Minister is acting against the Programme for Government. That  document also includes a specific target to:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% below 1990  levels by 2025&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The documentation representing Northern Ireland that was  sent by the Minister of the Environment to Ed Miliband, the Secretary of State  for Energy and Climate Change, is concerning. In that letter, the Minister of  the Environment states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;This campaign promotes anthropogenic climate change  as gospel and as you are no doubt aware, this is contrary to my views as  Minister of the Environment in Northern    Ireland. I do not believe that man-made  greenhouse gas emissions are the main cause of climate change and I do not  believe that the &lsquo;Act On&rsquo; messaging should appear in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is imposing his personal views; there is no  doubt about that. As I said earlier, that is contrary to the Programme for  Government, and that is the reason for the motion. There is a serious intent  behind the motion being proposed. The Minister&rsquo;s letter continues:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I do not wish to see &lsquo;Act On&rsquo; used in Northern Ireland and I do not wish for climate  change messages to be promoted by other Whitehall  departments here.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is even attempting to restrict Whitehall  Departments communicating any message here. He proposes some very interesting  aspects. He writes:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I propose the following Principles of Working for  officials to follow across the UK&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Of which point No 4 is:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;No &lsquo;Act On&rsquo; media promotion can be bought in a  Devolved Administration unless approved by that Administration.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">This is an interesting bit:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Leakage must be minimised using postcode lockouts,  when available,&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;and the additional costs this may incur should be  factored in to the resource requirement and the value for money assessment of  the media promotion.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have our Minister trying to dictate additional costs to  the entire United Kingdom  to promote his personal views. That is not credible: hence the reason for  bringing the motion forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: We  have had a debate. I am attempting to sum up the debate. It is important to  appreciate that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister wrote to not only Ed Miliband, but to Geoff  Hoon, the Secretary of State for Transport, stating:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;your officials have attempted to launch a UK wide  campaign on eco-driving&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">How terrible for the Secretary of State for Transport to  try to encourage energy efficiency in driving. The rest of the United Kingdom  is trying to promote those views. Northern   Ireland is being ridiculed in the eyes of the rest of the  United Kingdom.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I could have understood if that had come from a  Scottish-nationalist-dominated Minister in Edinburgh. However, I find it strange that a  unionist Minister is taking that stance, is trying to separate Northern Ireland, and is ridiculing Northern Ireland as regards actions that are  taking place in other parts of the United Kingdom. There has been a  major failure on the part of the Minister to give leadership in that area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now turn briefly to some of the comments made by  other Members. David McClarty highlighted an issue to which I have still not  heard an answer: is the Minister a fool, or is he deliberately misleading  others for political and other ends? I have not heard the answer to that. I  specifically asked during an intervention whether the Minister believed that  climate change was in any way affected by man, and the Minister failed to  respond. He used language to suggest that he does not believe that it is the  main factor, but does he believe that man contributes to it? We still have no  answer to that question. Until the Minister accepts the Programme for  Government, and accepts that man does contribute to climate change, he is not  giving leadership on the matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tommy Gallagher called on us all to endeavour individually.  This is a real issue, and we all have to try to take action. For the record,  Minister, I have changed my car: I have a Mini with much lower CO2 emissions within  the stable that my wife and I have. I find it rather cheap for the Minister to  go on the attack, and pick individual members of the Committee for the Environ&shy;ment  and produce figures on their CO2 emissions. He is trying to deflect from a very  serious issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  am trying to sum up my views, and I will not be deflected on that matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Weir said that the Minister was not acting against the  Programme for Government. I hope that I have demonstrated clearly that the  Minister&rsquo;s action is acting against the Programme for Government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Cathal Boylan highlighted the fact that the Act on CO2  message also contained an issue about energy efficiency. Given the way that oil  prices have been going, that is something on which we all need to start to take  action now. We all ought to be trying to reduce our energy consumption and,  thereby, reduce our CO2 consumption.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We should bear in mind that oil has peaked. The world&rsquo;s oil  supply is diminishing and that is why the price of oil went through the roof  over a year ago. Yes, the world&rsquo;s economy is in decline and there is now less  demand for oil. However, one cannot invent new oil. We get one go at using it,  and it cannot be reinvented. There can be no doubt that oil is a diminishing  supply and, therefore, we should be acting accordingly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members asked why we should accept all that scientific  evidence. It is the best evidence that is available and there are credible  theories behind it. Members should remember that, a short time ago, there was  the issue of the ozone layer opening up, thereby enabling greater levels of  light to enter and affect the earth&rsquo;s climate &mdash; particularly at the Antarctic &mdash;  and a decision was taken to ban CFCs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Guess what happened &mdash; the scientists got it right. The hole  in the ozone layer has started to close again, so sometimes scientists get  things right. Until there is evidence to the contrary, we should act on this  matter, not only to protect the environment and minimise climate change, but  also to protect our pockets &mdash; as the Minister and others have said &mdash; and to  protect us all against the diminishing oil supply.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">David Ford highlighted the need to legislate on these  issues. There can be no doubt about that. He also pointed out that the Minister  must lead by example, which has not happened. Alastair Ross seems to be a  sceptic. It seems that he is happy to follow the Scottish nationalist agenda  and simply do something different for the sake of being different.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Assembly&rsquo;s Research Services for obtaining  transcripts of the advertisements. No one who reads those advertisements will  see anything offensive in them. I hope that many people will take the  opportunity to read them. It is important that we move on and that proper  action is taken. It is important that we respect the Programme for Government  and take action to protect our environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister loves attacking others, but he drives a 4x4 &ldquo;Chelsea tractor&rdquo;. What  sort of example is that for the Minister of the Environment to set? The  Minister is also a double-jobber, so he probably flies to and from Westminster in one day.  He must have a huge carbon footprint. There is no doubt that, on occasion, he  flies back and forwards two or three times each week in order to do both jobs.  There are very practical issues that indicate that he is not setting a good  example as an Environment Minister. I wish that he would take that aspect of  his job more seriously and lead by example on this issue.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the findings in the recent report  from the chief inspector of the Education and Training Inspectorate that in  primary schools the overall quality of provision was not good enough in one  third of schools; that standards attained were not good enough in one quarter;  that there was too significant a variation in the standards of literacy and  numeracy attained; that the quality of teaching was in need of improvement in  one lesson in every five; that the quality of planning was inadequate in one  school in every ten; and that the quality of principals&rsquo; leadership is an area  for improvement in one quarter of schools; and calls on the Minister of  Education to place greater focus in early years and primary education,  including the low level of funding and the pupil-teacher ratio, encouraging  greater parental involvement and placing a greater emphasis on early  intervention and numeracy and literacy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This afternoon, not only in this debate but in that which  will follow, we will deal with issues that are of the utmost importance to  many, if not all, families in Northern    Ireland. As a result of these debates, we  will have a focus, for the right reasons, in relation to education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are lectured regularly about how an education system in Northern Ireland  &mdash; which matches pupils to the most appropriate school for their individual  needs &mdash; somehow leads to inequality and low levels of performance. That is a  tired argument that the Minister has regularly sought to employ. She has tried  to present herself as a champion of equality and excellence when, in fact, she  represents neither of those.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, when we get down to considering the information &mdash;  the facts of the case &mdash; the reality is very different. That is where the Minister  has often run into difficulties in the past. She has an inability to decipher  facts and acknowledge, let alone face up to, realities. Nonetheless, the  evidence remains: stark and true, it continues to cry against the Minister in  her policies, practices and priorities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">According to the Education and Training Inspectorate&rsquo;s  &lsquo;Chief Inspector&rsquo;s Report 2006-2008&rsquo;, we are forced to conclude that it is not  just the case that the Minister fails when she does not prioritise: she also  fails when she does prioritise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me give an example. Consider Irish-language education,  which is something to which the Minister has given priority and into which the  education system pours some &pound;20 million of public funds. At this juncture, I  must say that, unfortunately, the Minister has used the Irish language as a  political weapon.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What did the chief inspector&rsquo;s report have to say about the  Irish-medium sector? It said that there had been a slowdown in the growth of  the Irish-medium primary sector. Crucially, it also said:</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="font-size:8.5pt; ">&ldquo;Teachers  across the sector need to pay due attention to developing their own Irish  language competence.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It did not refer to &ldquo;excellence&rdquo; but merely to  &ldquo;competence&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a world of difference between excellence and  competence. The Minister might aspire to excellence in the performance of her  duties; the rest of us would be pleased if she could simply improve the state  of competence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">According to the chief inspector&rsquo;s report, even with regard  to the Minister&rsquo;s pet project &mdash; the Irish-medium sector &mdash; she has failed. The  obvious conclusion is that there are teachers in the Irish-medium sector who  are barely competent, if at all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us consider a few more facts. Long before pupils sit  assessment at the ages of 10 or 11, there are differences. For example, the  millennium cohort study found that by the age of three, children from dis&shy;advantaged  backgrounds are already one year behind more advantaged children in their  social and educational development. The Minister has sought to blame academic  selection for all the educational ills of Northern Ireland. By that, of  course, I refer to academic selection at 11 years of age; not three years of  age.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Minister&rsquo;s world, the influence of grammar schools  and the effect of academic selection at age 11 in some way reaches down through  the years to three-year-olds, and is the primary cause of all the disadvantages  in the education system. Surely, that cannot be the case. Anyone with eyes to  see ought to be able to conclude that that is not so. It ought to be clear that  those types of differences are not the fault of the selective system or of  grammar schools, nor are they down to academic selection at age 11. If the  Minister really wishes to deal with inequality and if she is really in the  equality business, she would prioritise that fact instead of her failed  attempts to impose her ideology on Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fact is that children who attend a good quality  preschool have better cognitive and intellectual outcomes. There is a marked  difference between them and children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Research  from the United States  indicates that investment in preschool education can bring about long-term  savings up to 13 fold. That demonstrates the need to invest more in early-years  provision and in primary provision. We still await the Minister&rsquo;s decision as  to what is happening for children between birth and the age of six. We wait, we  wait and we wait.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The chief inspector&rsquo;s report outlines a number of areas in  which primary provision must improve. Taking that report in the round, it does  not make good bedtime reading for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s education  system. There are issues that need to be addressed and there are issues that  must be addressed. Overall standards; varied literacy and numeracy levels;  quality of teaching; quality of planning; and quality of leadership at senior  management levels are all issues that the inspector highlighted and that need  to be tackled. It is through tackling those matters that we can make  improvements, not through continuing to talk down the successes in our  education system, which is the envy of others.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must improve outcomes for everyone. We cannot afford to  have young people with no qualifications. However, the level of  underachievement in Northern    Ireland is not as significant as the  Minister and others would have us believe. I know that the Minister is somewhat  concerned about the issue of achievement. Look at the report from the chief  inspector, and look at the research that was requested by the Education  Committee back in December. That information contradicts the Education  Minister&rsquo;s persistent claims about high levels of underachievement in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  education system. Of the four constituent parts of the United Kingdom, only England  performed marginally better than Northern Ireland in relation to the  percentage of pupils who received no grade results at GCSE level in 2005-06. Northern Ireland&rsquo;s figure of 3&middot;1% was much less  than Scotland&rsquo;s 4&middot;6% or Wales&rsquo;s 6&middot;8%.  Furthermore, the percentage of Northern    Ireland pupils who failed to achieve at  least five A to C grades at GCSE level was the lowest of the four home nations  by some distance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Not only is there the information received by the Education  Committee, and the inspector&rsquo;s report, there is another assessment contained in  the programme for international student assessment (PISA) results. So often, the PISA results are used by the Minister to  indicate that we are failing and that we are falling far behind. However, what  did PISA find  in its assessment of our education system?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It says that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  performance is broadly in line with the rest of the United   Kingdom; we outperform the OECD average in science, and Wales with  respect to reading. We want every pupil in Northern Ireland to reach their  potential, and my party will continue to develop a number of proposals to seek  to improve and seek to ensure that we move forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister must address seriously the issue of special  needs, which is included in the report. We are still waiting for the Minister&rsquo;s  final view on the future of special needs. The chief inspector makes particular  reference in the report to special needs. He is very concerned about the  provision and about what is happening in special-needs schools. In fact, he  made reference to the challenges in special-needs schools. I ask the Minister  whether she is prepared to consider those and to meet the DUP and other Members  to address the issue of special-needs schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are worries in particular boards because special  units are being closed down and the Minister still has not brought forward her  proposals. She has accused my party of blocking those proposals. In the light  of the report and of the concerns that are out there, will she explain how she  will address those needs?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom taca&iacute;ocht a  thabhairt don r&uacute;n seo.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion. That may be a surprise for some who  listened to Mr Storey&rsquo;s speech. However, unlike the Alliance Party, which was  somewhat sensitive about Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s contributions to a debate yesterday, we  support the motion, not the contributions from the Members on the opposite  Benches.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">After listening to Mr Storey, I am not sure what motion I  am rising to support. Is it an anti-Irish-language motion? Is it a motion to  attack the Minister? Or is it a serious attempt to improve standards in primary  schools? The wording of the motion concerns improving standards in primary  schools and reflecting on the inspectorate&rsquo;s report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Storey singled out the Irish-language sector for, in his  words, &ldquo;underachievement&rdquo;, but, given the mammoth task with which that sector  has been presented and the mountain that it has had to climb, its achieve&shy;ments  are amazing. Can there be improvements? Yes, there can be, and there should be.  Should there be investment in the Irish-language sector? Of course.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Parents want their children taught in the medium of Irish,  just as other parents want their children to be taught in the medium of  English. Under the Good Friday Agreement and the 1998 Act, parents have every  right to have their children taught in Irish. The Department of Education,  under the stewardship of Sinn F&eacute;in, will ensure that that right is protected.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  will not give way at this stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Academic selection is the old favourite issue. If the  Members opposite were to listen to what Members on this side of the Chamber  said, they would realise that we do not blame all of the woes of the education  system on academic selection. However, when children in primary schools are  divided halfway through the year and one set is sent to one side of the room  and given colouring pencils and the other set is sent to the other side of the  room and taught towards the test, there is no way that achievement in schools  can be equal across the sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in recognises that there is good in the education system  and that there is also poor management and skills. That is why the Minister has  set out a programme of policies which are all centred on the principle of  improving standards across the education sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The inspectorate&rsquo;s report is stark reading, but it should  be a surprise to no one. The Members opposite have lectured this side of the  House on many occasions, saying that we have a world-class education system.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My party says that we do not have a world-class education  system, but that within the system there are world-class educationalists  providing excellent education. However, the system itself is not world class.  Therefore, all the policies that the Minister has brought forward aim to  improve standards: the introduction and support of the revised curriculum;  &lsquo;Every School a Good School&rsquo;; the education and skills authority (ESA); and  investment in schools.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  If, as the Member says, those are all improvements, why is there a chorus of  people, such as the Catholic bishops, telling the Member&rsquo;s party and the House  that serious issues with respect to the ESA must be addressed because it is not  capable of delivering the very improvements that he says are paramount to  education?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The Catholic bishops are telling us that they are concerned that the Catholic  ethos will not be preserved under the ESA. I am glad that the Member is  defending that the Catholic ethos be taught in schools.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  did not say that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  That is what the Catholic bishops have said: they are concerned that the  Catholic ethos will not be preserved in schools under the ESA. If the DUP  supports that demand, that is an honourable statement from that party. Sinn  F&eacute;in protects the rights of schools to maintain their ethos. The Catholic  Church has every right to protect the ethos of Catholic schools. If there has  to be &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  will, in one moment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The reason why the time to deal with the Education Bill has  been extended is in order to hear as many views as possible &mdash; as the  Chairperson of the Education Committee, Mr Storey, has, quite rightly, said &mdash;  and to facilitate further discussion if needed. I will give way to Mr  McCausland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Will the Member, therefore, assure the House that he will support, in every  way, the ethos of the controlled sector and the cultural rights of children who  are educated in that sector? Will he ensure that as the Minister tries to move  forward with the ESA, that that will, indeed, be enshrined in legislation?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  can assure the Member. My party advocates a sectoral support group for the  controlled sector so that the cultural ethos of schools in that sector is  protected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to deal with Mr Storey&rsquo;s final comments, in which he  referred to special educational needs. Seriously &mdash; I must say that I am amazed  that the Member opposite is able to stand in the Chamber and demand that the  Education Minister tells the House what she is doing about special educational  needs when his party, and his party alone, has blocked investment of &pound;25  million in special educational needs because of its religious fundamentalist  views on life. You are not prepared to allow children of single parents to be  treated in an equitable way in the education system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The review of special educational needs is vitally  important for the education system. Your party &mdash; and your party alone &mdash; is  blocking it. You cannot, therefore, stand in the Chamber and demand that  someone else does something that you are blocking.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I commend the Members who have brought a most important motion to the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion highlights the stark fact that our education  system is in disarray. Children, parents and teachers face uncertainty as the  current school year moves towards its final term. While the Minister gallops  along on her ideological crusade &mdash; for all the world resembling &ldquo;Donna Quixote&rdquo;  as she tilts at the windmills of post-primary provision &mdash; her Department still  fails to address the problems highlighted in the damning Audit Office report  &lsquo;Improving Literacy and Numeracy in Schools&rsquo;, published in 2006, which showed  that targets were not achieved despite investment of around &pound;40 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At that time, the Department&rsquo;s response was that a review  of the school-improvement programme was also planned. At present, that same  Department has more reviews under way than there are in the West   End. It has reviews into provision for children from  nought-to-six, literacy and numeracy, special education, teacher education,  ICT, and so on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This timely report by chief inspector Goudie notes that  &ldquo;provision is simply not good enough&rdquo; and &ldquo;standards are too low&rdquo;. He states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Learners are thereby significantly disadvantaged and,  as a result, our society as a whole is diminished. In short, there is still  much work to be done to raise expectations and to close the achievement gap.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Those are the chief inspector&rsquo;s words, not mine.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to address the areas in which it is glaringly  obvious that action, rather than review, would make a significant difference to  the educational prospects of all our children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Paragraph 33 of the inspector&rsquo;s report notes the lack of  positive role models, especially for boys. The Department has failed to address  the issue of the low percentage of males who are entering the profession and  the disturbingly low number of male teachers in full-time posts, especially in  early-years classes in primary schools. Most male teachers tend to be in the  older age range, and, as they retire, the percentage of male role models will  continue to decrease, specifically in areas that are already marginalised.  Action is required, Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Young teachers leaving college are unable to gain full-time  employment and, consequently, to expand their professional expertise.  Furthermore, the continual loss of the most experienced members of the  profession dilutes the impact of the teaching force in the classroom. Despite a  guideline issued by the Department in 1992 &mdash; if I remember correctly &mdash; problems  associated with the re-employment of retirees to the detriment of young  teachers are still unaddressed. Action is required, Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A significant number of pupils in primary schools have  special educational needs that must be identified quickly. Individual  programmes must be put in place to remedy the problems, and support must be  given to parents, pupils and teachers in order to help them address those  issues. However, there is a shortage of educational psychologists across the  five education and library boards. That has caused a horrendous backlog of  pupils who are waiting to be assessed in schools, and schools are being forced  to draw up lists to deal with the allocated number of pupils that need to be  seen. Action is required, Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For many years, composite classes have been a common  feature in smaller rural primary schools where, because of the expertise of  teachers, the supportive approach of parents and pupils&rsquo; excellent attitudes to  education, a good quality of education has been maintained. However, the number  of composite classes in schools in urban areas, where attitudes to school are  often less than positive, is increasing. In that setting, composite classes do  not help the drive to raise literacy and numeracy standards. Action is  required, Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Primary schools are struggling, and principals have  highlighted the inadequate funding of primary schools and the cumulative impact  that that has had on schools that are trying to balance their moneys. It  considerably increases the burden on principals in the day-to-day running of  their schools. After all, principal teachers are not trained accountants: they  are trained teachers. Again, action is required.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Now enters the answer to all our educational woes &mdash; the  ESA. That wonder horse will raise standards. However, the Roman Catholic  Church, the controlled sector, the integrated sector, the voluntary sector and  a wide range of politicians, including those on the Education Committee, have  reservations. Moreover, the chief inspector said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There is a real and significant challenge ahead for  ESA in fulfilling these purposes, while establishing a more sustainable system  and meeting parental choice through the maintenance of differing types of  provision.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Finally &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I have said repeatedly in the House that children do not fail at the age of 11;  the current system fails them long before they reach that age. Indeed, it is  failing many in our &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  &mdash; marginalised communities before they even enter formal education. Urgent  action is required, Minister.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm p&aacute;irt a ghlacadh sa  d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo inniu.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to participate in the debate, and I thank the  Members who have brought the matter to the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate the schools, and I congratulate the teachers  who are doing a good job and achieving good standards. As the chief inspector&rsquo;s  report has highlighted, there is, undoubtedly, need for improvement in some  areas. The motion tends to focus on the empty part of the glass and highlights  the negative rather than the positive. Having said that, I am not suggesting  that we can afford to be complacent. We must continually strive to ensure that  the proposals outlined in the chief inspector&rsquo;s report are implemented and that  subsequent reports do not constantly revisit the same areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is totally unacceptable that in one third of our primary  schools the quality of provision is not good enough. However, the motion homes  in on the primary sector and largely ignores other sectors, including the  post-primary sector. We need to consider the whole education system that is the  subject of the report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One area that I found noteworthy is that of literacy and  numeracy, which has already been mentioned. In light of all the investment that  has already been made in that area, and of the Westminster Public Accounts  Committee&rsquo;s report and other reports, it is somewhat alarming that the chief  inspector is still questioning the effectiveness of monitoring and evaluation  of literacy and numeracy in primary schools. One fifth of pupils are failing to  reach standards appropriate to their age by the time they leave primary school,  and we are told that there is insufficient intervention for those children with  difficulties in numeracy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One would have thought that, by this stage, literacy and  numeracy would be a priority in most primary schools, at least to the extent  that monitoring and evaluation would be taking place across the board. It is  difficult for schools to take corrective action if the problems are not being  identified. Without effective monitoring and evaluation in schools, the  effectiveness of any future literacy and numeracy strategy will be very much  weakened.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is pleasing to learn from the report that the quality of  leadership and management in three quarters of primary schools is good or  better. However, it is disappointing that in one quarter of primary and  post-primary schools the leadership does not reach that standard and is, in  fact, in need of improvement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">School-development planning is mentioned by the  inspectorate as an area in need of improvement. Leadership is key in the  success of any school, and without adequate leadership the whole school effort  is weakened, and pupils&rsquo; learning suffers as a result. We cannot tolerate a  situation in which school leadership is insufficient in one quarter of primary  and post-primary schools. The inspectorate proposes more effective and robust  processes &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  The Member makes a valid point. Does the criticism of leadership in schools not  highlight the fact that the principals of those schools are being asked to take  on a burden over and above the educational burden that they have been trained  to assume and are being asked to carry out administrative and social-inclusion  tasks, and a whole plethora of things that have been added to the burden of a  principal in recent years? Is that not the point that I was making earlier, and  will the Member not agree with me on that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member will have one extra minute in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. It is commonly recognised in schools  that the number of initiatives having to be dealt with by school leaders is  placing an intolerable burden on them. There is obviously a need for greater  support for school leaders &mdash; not only support, but continual professional  development &mdash; that will enable them to meet the challenges that are outlined in  the chief inspector&rsquo;s report.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the fact that 80% of lessons taught are good  or better and that 50% of those lessons are deemed to be good or outstanding.  We should acknowledge that achievement, but we cannot accept a situation in  which 20% of lessons taught are not up to standard. Almost one third of the  lessons observed in post-primary schools are in need of improvement, with one fifth  of English lessons requiring improvement strategies. A regression has been  noted in pupils&rsquo; numeracy skills at the stage of transition between primary and  post-primary education. It is also worrying that the quality of planning in 10%  of primary schools is in need of improvement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many improvements have been noted by the inspectorate, and  we should congratulate schools on those achievements, but there are still major  areas in need of further improvement. There is a huge amount of work to be  done, and the report illustrates the challenge that the new education and  skills authority will face. However, I believe that, with proper support and  back-up resources from the Minister and the Department, schools will meet that  challenge. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: The  Alliance Party will support the motion. Through you, Mr Speaker, I ask Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd to check the figures, whereupon he will find that my party has supported  Sinn F&eacute;in motions more often than his party has supported DUP ones.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We support the motion for mainly the final section, which  calls on the Minister to take the various initiatives outlined in the motion.  The final line, which asks for:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a greater emphasis on early intervention and numeracy  and literacy.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">highlights the nub of the problem. The present  system, as has been highlighted by the chief inspector, is failing our  children, particularly those who live in areas of high social deprivation. In  the words of his report:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Improving the standards in literacy and numeracy  remains a major challenge&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He says that there is a need to raise standards  overall, and:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Schools must ensure &hellip; that all of their pupils,  whatever their ability, achieve a level of essential skills in line with their  full potential.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Mr Storey made the same point about potential. We  do not have to produce Einsteins; we just have to ensure that we get the best  out of everyone.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All of that surely points directly towards targeted early  intervention to nip the problem in the bud and avoid statistics such as those  contained in the chief inspector&rsquo;s report about attainment standards in  reading, writing and arithmetic at transfer age. We know that, left unattended,  those deficiencies will carry through to the end of school age and into later  life. How can pupils progress to higher learning if they are lacking in basic  reading skills? I have no problem with that section of the motion; the rest of  it gives me some cause for concern.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The chief inspector noted that the overall quality of  provision was not good enough in one third of primary schools, and that  standards attained were not good enough in one quarter of primary schools. That  means that he is quite satisfied with those that were attained in two thirds  and three quarters of primary schools, as Dominic Bradley rightly pointed out.  For me, however, the chief inspector&rsquo;s primary concern was about the proportion  of our workforce that is lacking completely in qualifications. It is  interesting, therefore, that the proposers of the motion and their party seem  so wedded to the educational system that has delivered that outcome. The chief  inspector also highlighted the problem of the uncertainty about post-primary  transfer. We will debate that issue later, so I mention it only to highlight to  the Minister that yet another important voice has emphasised that there is  extreme and widespread concern.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The three clauses of the motion that emphasise the  inspector&rsquo;s comments about the quality of teaching, the inadequacy of planning  and the quality of principals&rsquo; leadership cause me concern. Ken Robinson  rightly referred to that a moment ago when he mentioned the burdens that are  placed on head teachers. It is one thing for the chief inspector of schools to  mention those things in a dispassionate and analytical manner in the context of  a wide-ranging report. It is quite another to see them highlighted in a brief  Assembly motion that does not commend the many good outcomes that are noted in  the report. Teachers, and particularly principals, who are watching this debate  will need reassurance, especially from the proposers of the motion, that it is  not an attack on their professional standards. Other DUP contributors to the  debate will, perhaps, comment on that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  am quite happy to respond to that point. My party has always valued, as have  others, the educational excellence of our teaching profession. However, no one  &mdash; the Minister or any of us &mdash; can say that the report does not have an  important role to play in informing us and ensuring that we put in place mechanisms  that can address the issues that are raised in the report.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member will have an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  accept what the Member says.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Morale is low enough in our schools, and those who work in  them are among our best, but hardest-pressed, public servants. Ken Robinson is  absolutely right about the demands that are placed on head teachers in  particular. Having said that, I commend the final section of the motion, and my  party will support it. It is indisputable that our primary schools are a  comparatively underfunded part of our schools system, and that, as a result,  much of the work that is required to boost basic literacy and numeracy cannot  proceed. That is a ludicrous situation. We end up spending huge amounts of public  money on literacy and numeracy in later life, when the problem can much more  easily be solved right at the start of a child&rsquo;s education. I am sure that we  all agree about that, and I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  It goes without saying that my party values the contribution of staff in our  schools, but we cannot ignore, in the words of the chief inspector, that we are  failing substantial numbers of our children and their families, and are failing  in our provision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is not, nor should it be, about party politics or  academic selection. However, it should be focused on the scandal of how, in the  twenty-first century, there is a failure to meet the most basic needs of more  than 20% of our children in the education system. It should be about how we  intend to dress this matter because, blatantly, the current strategies have  failed to work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The chief inspector&rsquo;s report makes sobering reading and  identifies clearly that one fifth of children leave primary school after seven  years without the ability to read, write and count to the appropriate standard.  A total of 40% of children leave primary school without reaching the  appropriate standard in numeracy. That is simply unacceptable, and has enormous  consequences for those children in respect of their future educational  achievements and employment prospects. That signifies gross educational  inequality, because those children are primarily from the most disadvantaged  areas and backgrounds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Children who are entitled to free school meals are twice as  likely to leave school without any qualifications. Care-leavers are 20 times  more likely to leave school without any educational qualifications. As few as  23% of pupils from the most deprived backgrounds achieve five or more GCSEs,  compared with 64% of pupils from other backgrounds across Northern Ireland.  Of the total number of young people who took GCSEs last year, 25% failed to  gain a single pass at grade C, effectively depriving them of any qualification  that is valued by employers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds go  through the education system, they fall further behind. That creates an  ever-widening opportunity gulf that, by age 11, some children will never  overcome. Surely, we should tackle that gulf, head on. The answer does not lie  with helping children aged 11 or 16; it lies much earlier &mdash; before children  even start school &mdash; and rests with parents by giving them the capacity and  capabilities to support their children educationally. Research has shown that  if we invest only &pound;1 in the life of a child, we will make the most impact and  gain the highest return by investing in his or her early years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The ability gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged  children open up early &mdash; in the first few years of a child&rsquo;s life. With our  early-years strategy and provision, we can begin to address and prevent  disadvantage. There is no comfort for the Minister in the chief inspector&rsquo;s  assessment of early-years provision, because it identifies clearly the  variation in quality. Less than half of nursery provision is deemed to be &ldquo;very  good&rdquo; or better, and, in the voluntary and private centres, it is just over one  third. Indeed, that indicates a decline in overall effectiveness of the  provision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the Minister really wants to make a difference to the  equality of educational opportunity, she should address the provision and  funding for early years. Where is the strategy for children aged nought to six,  and why have we waited so long for its publication? It seems that early-years  provision is not a priority for the Minister. She has failed to make early  years either a policy priority or a funding priority.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other crucial factor in improving educational outcomes  for children is the involvement and support of parents. Research has demonstrated  that parental involvement is the main factor in making a difference. A key  indicator of success in further educational achievement, in particular, is that  of parents providing children with early access to books, and reading to their  children. One of the few mechanisms for supporting parents&rsquo; involvement in  education and their ability to be a co-educator for their children is extended  schools. However, we have seen only the most minimal of such programmes, and  the Minister appears to have given little or no priority to that in her  Department&rsquo;s budget. She has cut the budget for extended schools, and the  future of that programme remains uncertain.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the recent literacy and numeracy strategy, mere lip  service was paid to the involvement of parents in one paragraph towards the end  of the document; however, there was no real sense of commitment to ensure the  capacity and capability of parents to support their children&rsquo;s education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The chief inspector identifies that, in the most effective  schools, parents are involved from the outset, they are given comprehensive  information on their child&rsquo;s progress, and they are shown how to help through  parental workshops.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Make no mistake &mdash; this is a scandal, and one in which the  Minister plays no small part.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member must bring her remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  She continually tells us that she is the Minister of Education. This report  tells us that she is the Minister of failure.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the publication of the  Education and Training Inspectorate report, which is a necessary tool in  identifying strengths and weaknesses across the education sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of issues are identified in the report, many of  which are positive. Some of the issues raised are less positive and areas are  identified for improve&shy;ment. We must not lose focus on the chief inspector&rsquo;s  statement that a majority of our children, young people and adult learners  continue to achieve well and that there has been improvement over the past two  years. That is not to be complacent; there are, without doubt, areas for  improvement. However, we must put on record our recognition of the excellent  work and standards of our teachers and principals in schools across the North,  who ensure that all our children have the skills and education necessary for  the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For too long, our education system has been focused on  inequality. Therefore, it is no surprise that the chief inspector found that  the biggest gap in educational attainment &mdash; especially in literacy and numeracy  &mdash; is among those children from socially disadvantaged areas. I have a number of  statistics that Michelle McIlveen quoted, and I will not repeat them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is time to focus on ensuring that all children receive  the kind of education that provides them with the best start and the best  skills that they need for life. That means that we must focus on primary-school  years, because that is when we build the basic skills of literacy and numeracy,  and ensure that children who fall behind are immediately given the help that  they need. That is why the recent literacy and numeracy strategy focused on  classroom teachers as a critical instrument in ensuring the engagement of  children in learning and achieving the basic skills.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Making every school a good school is core to the Minister&rsquo;s  agenda, and it is the only real mechanism to ensure that all children are given  a fair chance of a decent education. The Minister supported the extended  schools programme, which is essential in ensuring that children are supported  beyond the classroom and are ready to learn when the school day begins. Through  the provision of breakfast clubs, support with homework and activities at the  end of the school day, the Minister has also ensured that children are best  equipped to cope with the school environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the extended schools programme has been a  vehicle for ensuring the involvement of parents, which is essential for  children to succeed. Many parents, especially those from socially deprived  backgrounds, may not have had a positive experience in school. In order to  ensure that those parents do not pass that attitude on to their kids, the  extended schools programme has been used by many schools to support parents to  help their children and also to attract parents back into learning. That is why  the Minister, despite budgetary restrictions, has continued to support the  extended schools programme throughout her time as Minister of Education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Undoubtedly, there is still much work to be done. The  report identifies the issues that need to be addressed, which the Minister will  take forward. Sinn F&eacute;in and the Minister are committed to making sure that we  have the best education system for all our children, not just for the  privileged few.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Given that the Minister has been in her post for less than two years, it would  be inappropriate to blame her for everything that is wrong with our education  system. Nonetheless, there are things in the report that we need to learn from  and take cognisance of. The Minister&rsquo;s actions until now do not provide great  encouragement that a report in years to come will point to significant  improvements that were made during her tenure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Once again, a challenging issue in the report is the number  of people who leave school without educational qualifications. That is a huge  challenge for all of us. Unfortunately, the single focus of the Minister to  address that problem has been on academic selection and transfer from primary  school to secondary school, instead of where the problem starts. If people want  to get to the nub of a problem, they need to go to where the problem starts &mdash;  not halfway through the process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The problems start with early-years funding and support.  The report repeatedly highlights the benefits of nursery education and the quality  of nursery schools. It also highlights the fact that nursery schools achieve  higher standards than private-sector playgroups. However, in many areas across Northern Ireland,  those nursery facilities do not exist. Why is the Minister so focused, concentrated  and driven on the issue of post-primary transfer but not focused, concentrated  or driven on the provision of nursery education for our children?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need our children to have the right start, and that is  what the report states. It states that we are weak at the start of the  education process, and as a consequence, we are weak at its conclusion.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I challenge the Minister to use the findings of the report  to get her house in order on education. Let us see that some good has come out  of the time that she has happened to be the Minister of Education. That &ldquo;some  good&rdquo; could be to ensure that in their very early years, our young people are  resourced properly and adequately, with the right people and the right  education system in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Raising education funding by 0&middot;01% was a pathetic effort.  That was done by moving the threshold from 1&middot;04% to 1&middot;05% for our primary  schools for this year. I say to the Minister that that is not good enough. It  is not satisfactory, and as a consequence, the reports that we will get on  education and on this particular Minister in the future will read &ldquo;fail&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I sometimes wonder whether I am living in some kind of land of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. We keep  having these discussions over and over again, yet nothing seems to change. The  essence of what the Ulster Unionist Party has been trying to say about the  education debate is that it is not about the 11-plus; it is about what happens  at 11-minus and much earlier. It is about primary school, pre-primary school  and nursery education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The statistics in the chief inspector&rsquo;s report highlight  certain challenges. When we look at those, we come back to the universal truth,  which is that the single most important determining factor in our children&rsquo;s  education is the quality of our teachers, particularly that of our school  leaders.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have tried everything to communicate with the Minister of  Education. I have rationalised, pleaded, brought information to the table, and  I have &mdash; occasionally &mdash; let my emotions get the better of me. However, none of  those seem to cut it or to make any difference.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In bringing out salient information, if one wants to see  what we have to do for the future, one has only to look across the water to Scotland, which  has a fully comprehensive system. I borrowed a book from the Assembly Library  called &lsquo;The Quality and Equity of Schooling in Scotland&rsquo;, which is a review of  the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Programme for  International Student Assessment (PISA) report. It states that around 15% of  primary 6 pupils were not reaching the agreed standard of reading at level C.  That rose to 26% of pupils in primary 7 and to 36% of pupils in secondary year  one.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The book goes on to state the disparity of results in Glasgow, where there are  multiple levels of deprivation. Those are precisely the areas where there are  difficulties in reading, writing, scientific endeavour and so on. The lesson is  clear: we will not be able to solve the issue without looking at the underlying  causes of the problem. Those causes are social and economic deprivation, that  is, multiple levels of deprivation. If you do not fix those issues, you will  not fix anything else.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I say to the Minister as calmly and as reasonably as I can  that we want to see change. We want to focus resources and attention on those  schools that are struggling to meet some very real challenges. In that regard,  the almost incessant chatter about the 11-plus is a red herring, because it is  distracting us from the real job. If people really want to make a difference to  the young people of Northern    Ireland, and if they really want to see what  can be done, the essence of the solution is to make every school a really good  school.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Does the Member accept that while he and others have been chattering about the  11-plus, the Minister and the Department have moved on with a raft of changes  to the education system that are focused solely on improving standards?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member has an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I will use that extra minute to say that when I was  talking about Members chattering, I was not talking just about people on this  side of the House; I was talking about people on all sides of the Chamber.  Nobody is getting to grips with the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If one considers the matter, one realises that there is  much to unite us. There is a common desire to improve the educational  underachievement of many people in Northern Ireland, from whatever  side. There is no sense in which one person is right and the other is wrong;  there are lessons to be learned from all people, but those lessons must be  learned. The issue comes down to the fact that we all want to find a way of  concentrating resources, as the inspector pointed out, in the schools that need  help &mdash; the schools that are challenged by really difficult social systems. It  is no good for us up here to pontificate about that unless we are prepared to  do something about it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the Minister were to come &mdash; and I have said this to her  in the past &mdash; with a proposal to give more funding to primary schools, she  would find some support. Had she said that for the long-term future of Northern Ireland  we must invest more in nursery provision, I think that she would have received  support. We must not allow ourselves to become involved in ideological rants or  to go down the road of rhetoric. We must try to find a way to work together on  this matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no bigger test for the Assembly than to find a  satisfactory solution to the education debate. It is not about politics; it is  about people and all our children. Having put that message across, I hope that  the Minister will consider the points that we have raised. The Ulster Unionist  Party joins with others in asking the Minister to invest more in primary  schools and in teachers. Please put our children before politics.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  On reading the motion, my first thought was of the absolute shock felt by  members of the Education Committee when we were furnished with the chief  inspector&rsquo;s report. The statistics are worrying, to say the least, so it is up  to us to instigate improve&shy;ments for the future of pupils and of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the motion concentrates on primary schools, the  results for post-primary schools must also be evaluated. There is little in the  report of which to be proud. Despite the hard work of teachers, levels of  quality, assessment and management hardly reach the dizzy heights. However,  given the conditions and abuse through which some teachers must work, that is  hardly surprising. Just two weeks ago, my colleague Dominic Bradley tabled a  motion pertaining to violence against teachers. Some teachers face violence day  and daily, and, therefore, we must not slaughter them for those results.  However, we must tackle the system, one that is clearly not working.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The chief inspector has given us guidance on how to improve  areas that are not up to scratch, but, in order to make those improvements, we  need the means to do so. That is where the Minister can play her part. If that  means that she reconsiders her budget allocations, then that must be done.  Where there is need, we must attend to it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One point in the report is particularly alarming. It  states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Important issues highlighted in a survey report in  May 2005 are still relevant. Only one-third of the primary schools have a clear  focus on ICT to support teaching and learning in all classes across the  curriculum. In addition, primary schools need to develop more systematic  monitoring and evaluation of their ICT provision, and to continue to provide  appropriate staff development.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report must be considered well and acted upon, and that  will require leadership, effort and money from the Department. Therefore, I  implore the Minister to support schools, give them guidance and, more  importantly, provide them with the funding that they require.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Parental involvement is in no sense a new matter. However,  parents in my constituency are sometimes reluctant to become involved in the  school community, or even to approach teachers about their child. In Australia,  there is a long history of parental involvement in the classroom. Parents must  take their turn to take part in reading, play and exercise. I am fully aware  that, in order to protect children, parents would have to be assessed and  vetted, but the system works there, and, although it would take time to  implement and to encourage parents to take part here, it is possible to achieve  higher levels of literacy and numeracy and to create a more unified and  welcoming education environment for all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Education and stimulation in the early years are vital and  highly recommended. However, a situation exists in which working parents have  real difficulty finding places at preschool for their children because of the  lack of places and the fact that the available places are already allocated to  children whose parents receive benefits.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That situation lies at the door of the Education Minister,  but it demands answers and assistance from many other Departments. After all,  we are working towards one goal &mdash; a better and a shared future that starts at  school and, for some, at preschool. A shared future is a shared responsibility.  There must be action in order to achieve that, not words on paper that gathers  dust on a shelf. We must not let down our children again. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  reviewed the chief inspector&rsquo;s recent report on the state of our schools with  interest, as did the authors of the motion. The report&rsquo;s findings, which are  outlined in the motion, are not great news. However, the report is not all doom  and gloom; it also contains a number of positive findings. Others in the  Chamber have fulfilled their role by delivering that information.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the long-running debate over the great strengths  and unjustifiable weaknesses of education in this country, there were no real  surprises in the report for me. We have understood for years the value of  early-years education and intervention that involves removing inequalities and  giving children their best start in life. Yet we struggle to fully develop,  deliver and fund that provision, even in our most deprived areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have known for decades that our primary schools are  under-resourced and that that is based on an historical legacy of social  condescension &mdash; elementary schools were for the masses, and not much was  expected of the masses. Nonetheless, we continue to fund our primary schools at  the lowest per-pupil level in the UK. It has been known for centuries  that children who cannot read and write become adults who are more likely to be  economically inactive. In modern society, failings in literacy and numeracy are  penalties for life, yet we fail to set and to meet appropriate standards in  those subjects for all our children and young adults.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are ongoing and serious challenges that require  immediate and appropriate attention, but they are not news. The real feature of  the report was the chief inspector&rsquo;s commentary, in which the findings were put  in context. In that commentary, he offers direction for those in the Chamber  with the responsibility for creating, scrutinising and supporting policy that  affects education. He states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We must focus our  efforts clearly on reducing the gap between those who currently benefit most  from our overall education system and those whose educational achievements are  constrained by the poverty of social deprivation, of low aspirations, and,  increasingly, the challenges of coping with modern society.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That goal is at the heart of my party&rsquo;s education  policies, and I believe that the policy objectives outlined in the motion are  the correct means of moving towards that aim. Only by delivering comprehensive  early-years provision, fully-funded and resourced primary education, greater  support for parental involvement, and a firm focus on high standards in  literacy and numeracy will we start to reduce the massive gaps in our education  system and, therefore, in our society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also refreshing to see the DUP taking an interest in  all primary students and not just those who are on their way to grammar school.  We have challenged our primary schools not only with educational attainment,  but also with major critical pastoral-care issues, which they have admirably  taken on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Primary schools in east Belfast face particular challenges. Of the 20  most deprived areas in Northern Ireland,  14 are in Belfast, and four of those wards are  in inner east Belfast.  Those four wards are among 10% of the most deprived areas. Primary schools in  those areas face difficulties well beyond the three Rs. Most teachers and  principals in those schools embrace the additional responsibilities that come  with delivering pastoral and social care as well as education. However, they  are in dire need of real, flexible funding that will allow them to meet the  changing demands on their schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Education has delivered several principled  statements in the Chamber about where she sees the Northern Ireland education system  heading. I support a number of the principles that she has outlined in relation  to removing inequalities and creating a system in which all children are  selected for something, rather than just academically.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Minister is failing to turn those principles  into clear policies that can be implemented. I recognise that there are  obstacles to turning the policy objectives of the motion into reality, but I  believe that those objectives offer a workable framework that she should  consider. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome  the debate, and I am pleased to speak to Members about quality and standards in  the education system. The wide-ranging nature of the motion highlights the  complex issues. There are no simple solutions, but that is not an excuse for  inaction. Today, I will set out for Members my approach to ensuring that every  schoolchild is supported in reaching her or his potential.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mar Aire Oideachais, ba ar na p&aacute;ist&iacute; a bh&iacute; an f&oacute;cas agam  ariamh. &Eacute;ir&iacute;onn go maith le roinnt p&aacute;ist&iacute;, agus is ceart agus c&oacute;ir sin a  cheili&uacute;radh. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo inniu, mar is l&eacute;ir go  bhfuil Comhalta&iacute; &oacute; gach p&aacute;irt&iacute; ag glacadh leis faoi dheireadh go bhfuil p&aacute;ist&iacute;  eile ann nach mbainean na caighde&aacute;in is airde amach.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister of Education, my focus has always been on  children. Some children are high achievers, and we are right to celebrate that.  Members from all parties are beginning to realise that other children do not  achieve the highest standards. I welcome their realisation because, as Members  will remember, when I took up my post as Minister, some parties were focusing  almost exclusively on the so-called &ldquo;world-class&rdquo; education system and were  paying little, or no, attention to the lack of standards or to underachieving  children. I am pleased that the Assembly is moving in the right direction. I am  glad that the message has been heard, and I look forward to working with all  parties to deliver the far-reaching programme of reform that is under way and  is specifically designed to address the issues that have been raised today, and  those that affect children from all communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have much to be proud of, as our system provides top-end  qualifications to the most able pupils. However, it must also be recognised  that many more children leave school with inadequate educational achievements.  The chief inspector&rsquo;s report highlights the good or excellent work in schools  and the improvements that have been made. There is much good practice that  should be acknowledged, celebrated and shared.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the report also sends out a clear message that  more must be done to raise standards. It identifies areas in which educational  provision is simply not good enough. I am committed to equality, and that  inequality of provision must be addressed. The Assembly must ensure that all  pupils, regardless of where they live, background, gender, disability, race or  sexual orientation, are given the opportunity to fulfil their potential.  Subsequently, all children, not only a privileged few, will be able to develop  their skills, knowledge and self-confidence, and they will help to build a  fairer, better and more equal society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The chief inspector&rsquo;s report makes it clear that now is the  time for strong leadership. He rightly values leadership in schools for the  vital contribution that it makes to educational excellence. Political  leadership is equally important. Let us be clear that leadership is not simply  about being popular; it is about being strong, making tough decisions and  standing up to be counted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No matter how hard it may seem at the time, leadership is a  matter of setting a process on the right track to improve a particular  situation. Leadership is about remembering that, at the heart of every  difficult decision are the children sitting in the classrooms, and they have  only one chance to pass through the education system. For them, I will do what  I think is right, whether or not that is easy. I invite all political parties  to join me in facing the challenge of showing leadership for the benefit of  every child in the school system, because they all deserve that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report of the chief inspector, Stanley Goudie, helps to  chart where leadership must be shown, and I met him to discuss the detail of  the report and his recommendations. I also asked for copies to be made  available to all schools and their boards of governors. The permanent secretary  of my Department wrote to every principal and the chairperson of every board of  governors to highlight the report and the need to take action now.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The importance of raising standards for every pupil and  making every school a good school underpins all the issues. Indeed, &lsquo;Every  School a Good School&rsquo; is the title of the new school improvement policy that I  will publish shortly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Teachers and young people helped to shape our school  improvement policy by telling us what drives improvement and what characterises  a good school. A key message is that every school should be striving to improve  learning and teaching. The Department will set policy, but schools, through  self-evaluation, will lead improvement at every level. They will need appropriate  support and challenge, and, for that to be effective, we must undertake a  reform programme to help schools to raise standards for our children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">M&aacute; t&aacute; an beartas um fheabhs&uacute; scoileanna le bheith ioml&aacute;n  &eacute;ifeachtach, caithfidh s&eacute; teacht leis an chl&aacute;r leathan leasuithe: leasuithe a  thosa&iacute;onn sna luathbhlianta sula dt&eacute;ann p&aacute;ist&iacute; ar an mbunscoil; leasuithe ar an  gcuraclam; agus leasuithe ar oideachas m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; agus ar riachtanais  speisialta agus cuimsi&uacute;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In order to be fully effective, the new school improvement  policy must be complemented by that wider reform programme: reforms that begin  in the early years before children enter primary schools, reforms of the  curriculum, of teacher education, of special needs and inclusion, and reforms  that affect how children move from primary school, including transfer 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some parties choose to ignore the whole area of selection  and the effects that it has on underachievement. If those parties continue to  read and research into the causes of underachievement, they will see the gaps  that open up at P5, P6 and P7. While some of our children are being taught to a  test, and others are sitting at the back of the classroom doing time fillers,  children in the rest of Ireland,  children in England, Scotland and Wales, and children throughout the  world, are learning a broader, much more interesting curriculum. We ignore the  link between selection and underachievement at our peril, because the children  will suffer the disadvantage by parties continuing to ignore that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us begin at the beginning. A child&rsquo;s early years are  vital for development and well-being. The foundations for success are laid in  those early years before a child gets to primary school. We must support our  children at the beginning of their educational journey, a journey that starts  at birth.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The influence of parents can be the single most important  factor in a child&rsquo;s ability to access learning successfully. We have programmes  in place to support parents as they fulfil their vital role &#8213; programmes such  as Sure Start, which help to promote the physical, intellectual and social  development of preschool children, particularly those from disadvantaged areas.  I have visited many Sure Start programmes, including one in Mount Vernon, and, last Friday, I visited a  very good Sure Start programme in Downpatrick. We also have the home childcare  approval scheme and the early years development fund. Those help to provide a  good foundation for children&rsquo;s future learning, as does the preschool education  expansion programme, which provides one year of high-quality preschool  education for every child whose parents wish it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those programmes show our commitment to setting children on  the path to age-appropriate learning before they even start school. The  importance of early years is why my Department is developing a strategy for  that important time in a child&rsquo;s life. The early years strategy will ensure a  smooth transition from the home, through preschool settings, to primary school.  It will ensure that a solid framework is in place for early childhood to  prepare children for life at school and beyond. In order to build on a good  start, children need the best possible transition to formal schooling. We have  introduced the foundation stage curriculum for years one and two to help to  develop confident children who are engaged in learning. The curriculum stage  provides a curriculum suitable for our youngest pupils, with the focus on  developing the literacy and numeracy skills that they need for a successful  future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have secured &pound;32 million over three years to support the  foundation stage curriculum. That means that, for the first time, all pupils in  years one and two have access to classroom assistants. In addition, we are in  the process of initiating a fundamental, comprehensive review of the common  funding formula, and I welcome Members&rsquo; comments from all sides of the House  that they want to see money going in on the basis of need and inequality and  getting into the most disadvantaged areas. I can assure Members that the comprehensive  review will ensure that we get money into our primary schools.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: No, I will not give way. The Member has had his opportunity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to extended schools, we have recognised the key  role of parents in their children&rsquo;s education. Parents are the first educators  and should be part of a partnership to support their children. Extended schools  are already building those partnerships: parents are supported to value  education, encourage their children and provide stimulating learning  experiences. That helps children develop self-confidence and the will to  succeed, within a loving and caring home environment. The extended-schools  programme is central to that important educational area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have written to the Minister of Finance, and I very much  look forward to his support for the additional money that I need for extended  schools. I welcome the support of everyone in the House to ensure that my  Department receives that needed money. I have that money for the following  year, as I have mainstreamed it into my budget, but I very much look forward to  the Minister of Finance supporting me in that important work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn now to special educational needs and the inclusion  review, and in doing so I must join with my colleague John O&rsquo;Dowd. I have  brought my review to every Executive colleague, and I have received comments  from every Executive colleague except one. However, to date, there has been a  refusal by one party to put that review on the agenda. Although I welcome the  comments that I have heard in the Chamber today, I very much look forward to  the review of special needs and inclusion being placed on the agenda &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I will not give way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want a review of special educational needs and inclusion  and &pound;25 million on top of the &pound;188 million. I want that on the agenda, and that  is where people&rsquo;s priorities must lie, rather than the attempts to block it  that we have had in the past. Hopefully, we are now living in new times and we  will not continue with that. If we can quickly identify a child who is having  difficulties or struggling, early interventions can be put in place to support  that child.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Leagtar amach molta&iacute; san athbhreithni&uacute; ar riachtanais speisialta  agus cuimsi&uacute; do chreatlach taca&iacute;ochta a bheas n&iacute;os l&aacute;idre agus n&iacute;os cuntasa&iacute;  agus a thabharfaidh aghaidh ar riachtanais gach p&aacute;iste a luaithe is f&eacute;idir,  cib&eacute; c&eacute;im oideachais ag a bhfuil siad.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The review of special educational needs and inclusion sets  out proposals for a more robust and accountable support framework addressing  the needs of all children as early as possible, whatever their stage of  education. I have secured &pound;25 million in support of that review, and I very  much look forward to moving forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said, the transfer test has had a damaging and  distorting effect on our primary curriculum and on our children. For those who  opted into the test, preparation narrowed much of primary 6 and 7, whereas those  who opted out of the test were often marginalised. I am delighted that the  distortions of the transfer test are behind us. That &mdash; along with the transfer  2010 guidance &mdash; will help to address inequalities in the system. I hope that  all schools will adhere to that guidance. I especially hope that grammar  schools will choose not to practice academic selection and will choose the  pathway of equality rather than the pathway of inequality. transfer 2010 is an  opportunity for all grammar schools to make their excellent provision available  in a fair manner, for the first time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tr&iacute; aistri&uacute; 2010 beidh bunscoileanna agus iarbhunscoileanna  araon &aacute;balta d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar a bpr&iacute;omhthasc: tortha&iacute; a fheabhs&uacute;. The literacy and  numeracy strategy aims to raise standards for all young people and reduce the  gaps in achievement between the least and most disadvantaged. It is based on  existing good practice in our schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Delivering on all those reforms relies on education  professionals. Yesterday, I attended a very good seminar at the Universities&rsquo;  Council for the Education of Teachers, along with inspectors such as Stanley  Gowdy and other inspectors from England,  Scotland, Wales and across the island of Ireland.  Leadership and the raising of standards, which play a vital role in our  schools, were some of the key areas that were addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Recognising the importance of teacher training and  leadership development means that we must deliver them as efficiently and  effectively as possible. To that end, the education and skills authority, which  is due to be established in January 2010, will have a clear duty to promote  high standards. Establishing ESA will make better use of available funds, and  that is equally important when considering school funding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We heard the usual rants and prejudice against the Irish  language.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Time. The Minister&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I pay tribute to the Irish-medium sector. I have spoken to  representatives of all the Irish-medium schools and representatives of the  education and skills authority. They are studying the positive findings of the  report and the areas in which there is need for improvement. To quote  selectively is not the way forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Members who tabled the motion. I welcome the  chief inspector&rsquo;s report, and I look forward to working with Stanley Goudie and  his team in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I am glad to say that there was support from every part of the Chamber for the  motion that was tabled by the DUP members of the Committee for Education. That  is an acknowledgement of the importance of the issue that we have been  discussing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mervyn Storey moved the motion by reiterating the point  that has been made many times by folk from this side of the Chamber: the  Minister constantly links together selection and underachievement. True to  type, she did that in the latter part of her contribution today. The failure is  not in that regard, but I will return to that subject later in my speech. The  issue in respect of the Minister&rsquo;s funding is about policies, practices and  priorities. Mr Storey identified those three points. The Minister has the wrong  priorities, and, often, the wrong focus.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Differences in educational achievement arise long before  assessment at the age of 11. Differences and disadvantages are evident at the  age of three. Therefore, there is a need for greater investment in preschool  provision, and the benefits that accrue from that will be obvious.  Underachievement is not as widespread as is sometimes suggested, but it needs  to be addressed as a priority.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">John O&rsquo;Dowd defended Sinn F&eacute;in policy, and informed the  House that all the Minister&rsquo;s policies are about improving standards &mdash; however,  he was not convincing. Subsequently, he launched into a bizarre and  incomprehensible comment on religious funda&shy;mentalism, which baffled folk on  this side of the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ken Robinson reminded us of the recommendations that were  identified in the Audit Office&rsquo;s 2006 report, &lsquo;Improving Literacy and Numeracy  in Schools&rsquo;. The content of the Education and Training Inspectorate&rsquo;s report is  not new; it has been identified already. Ken Robinson spoke also of the  plethora of departmental reviews, and he said that the Education and Training  Inspectorate&rsquo;s report brings a breath of reality to the situation. I am glad to  say that Ken Robinson talked about social factors, such as the lack of role  models for boys in schools, the subsequent importance of having more male  teachers, and the difficulties that are being faced by young teachers in  seeking full-time employment. It is important to emphasise the relationship  between social factors and underachievement in education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ken Robinson described the ESA as a wonder horse, and, once  again, the Minister proved true to form by reminding the House that the ESA  would be the answer to all our woes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley said that we cannot be complacent and that  the recommendations of the report should be implemented. He also reminded us  that substantial investment has been made in numeracy and literacy, but that  the problem remains. He spoke about the need for strong leadership in our  schools. In an intervention during Dominic Bradley&rsquo;s speech, Ken Robinson said  that too many demands and burdens were being placed on school principals, who  are not principals, but they are teachers, administrators and social workers &mdash;  they have to fulfil a plethora of roles. There was agreement on that  intervention.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Trevor Lunn commented on the comparative underfunding of  primary schools, and that has been identified in the motion. Money can be spent  on the later stages of education, but a better return will be achieved if  investment is made in the early stages. We want to convey to the Minister that  the funding of early-years provision, preschool and the early years of primary  school should receive priority.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Does the Member agree that it would be beneficial if the Minister were to  ring-fence the funding for early-years provision? If she did that, the people  who provide it would not be surviving hand to mouth. They cannot plan without  ring-fenced funding.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. There is agreement that greater  weighting in respect of funding should be given to early-years provision and  that the money must be invested there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Michelle McIlveen spoke about the need to value our  primary-school teachers. We can have all the necessary resources &mdash; school  buildings, and so forth &mdash; but we will not get anywhere if we do not have good  teachers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we value teachers, affirm the work  that they do, recognise the difficult circumstances in which they work, and  give them all the support that they need. That is where the issue of funding  comes in, particularly at that early stage, as it is important to ensure that  classes are small and that the pupil-teacher ratio is appropriate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Miss McIlveen reminded us that one fifth of children leave  primary school with a low level of literacy and numeracy, and she quoted a  range of figures &mdash; which I will not repeat &mdash; that highlighted the differential  between some of the more disadvantaged areas and other areas. She referred to  the need to support parents so that they can support their children. That point  was picked up by others at a later stage, and I know that Mary Bradley also  brought the role of parents to our attention.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The highest return can be got by investing at an early  stage; therefore, the early-years strategy is important. Why are we waiting for  that strategy? No policy, no priority &mdash; that is the indictment on the Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Michelle O&rsquo;Neill said that the report shows that a majority  continue to achieve well but that we must not be complacent. She also commented  on extended schools; however, the problem is that the Minister did not  prioritise the extended schools scheme. Mrs O&rsquo;Neill also referred to the  opportunity to engage with parents, which is a point that a number of  contributors commented on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Edwin Poots said that the Minister has been in her post for  fewer than two years &mdash; it merely seems like a lifetime. Children leaving school  without qualifications is an issue, but we need to go to where the problem  starts, rather than dealing with it halfway through the education system. That  brings us back to the need for good nursery- and primary-level provision. The  increase in primary funding that has been obtained so far has been negligible,  and that is not good enough.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea said that the issue is not about the 11-plus;  it is about what happens at 11-minus. He quoted from a book but did not get  removed from the Chamber &mdash; I must learn from him how to do that, because I have  not quite worked that out yet.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  It depends on the book.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Yes; it is probably a question of what book one reads.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mary Bradley said that she was shocked at the Enterprise, Trade and  Investment report. The inspectorate has given guidance on improvement, and that  is good. We are glad that that guidance is there; the Minister must now take  note of it. Mrs Bradley said that the Minister may need to review financial  allocations and effectively reprioritise, and she also spoke of the potential  role for parents in schools. When she was speaking, it occurred to me that we  are told &ldquo;every school a good school&rdquo;, but we are talking about every child a  good start. Every child must get a good start &mdash; that is, a good foundation that  will take them right through the education system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dawn Purvis spoke of a number of positives in the report;  however, she also referred to the historic underfunding of primary schools and  the low levels of aspiration, which is an important issue. We need to help  children to develop a good level of aspiration and help them to be ambitious so  that they can have a good future. She said there was a need for comprehensive  early-years provision, and she referred also to pastoral and social care, as  well as basic education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister then spoke and said a number of things that I  found interesting. She welcomed the fact that members of all parties are  &ldquo;beginning&rdquo; to realise that there is an issue of underachievement. That comment  was patronising, offensive and erroneous, because those of us on this side of  the Chamber who work in communities that have suffered from underachievement  for a considerable time have been identifying and pursuing that issue and have  sought to have it addressed. We have done that through such means as our  membership of education and library boards, working on schools&rsquo; boards of  governors, working in communities with schools, or working as members of the  Committee for Education here. I found the comment thoroughly offensive and  inappropriate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the Minister seemed to suggest that she was the only  person who ever visited any school in the Shankill or in any other area? Will  he take this opportunity to say that all of us in this Chamber visit all those  schools?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  In fact, some of us were working on the Shankill Road at a time when her  associates were bombing the Shankill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that leadership is not about being popular  &mdash; my colleague Mervyn Storey said that on that basis, she must be the most  effective leader in the world.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Will the Speaker rule on whether that comment  by Mr McCausland contravenes the Speaker&rsquo;s earlier ruling about such comments?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I will review the Hansard report and come back to the Member directly, or to  the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I remind the Member that there has long been an association in the past &mdash; and I  was referring to the past. There has been an association over many years  between political republicanism and militant military republicanism. The  position is clear, and I made it clear. I said &ldquo;over years&rdquo;. There seems to be  a sensitivity &mdash; a deep sensitivity &mdash; in some quarters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister reverted to type and blamed selection as one  of the key problems.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member bring his remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  She said that ESA would be the answer to all our woes. Many of us remain to be convinced  &mdash; I think that she has other convincing to do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the findings in the recent report  from the chief inspector of the Education and Training Inspectorate that in  primary schools the overall quality of provision was not good enough in one  third of schools; that standards attained were not good enough in one quarter;  that there was too significant a variation in the standards of literacy and  numeracy attained; that the quality of teaching was in need of improvement in  one lesson in every five; that the quality of planning was inadequate in one  school in every ten; and that the quality of principals&rsquo; leadership is an area  for improvement in one quarter of schools; and calls on the Minister of  Education to place greater focus in early years and primary education,  including the low level of funding and the pupil-teacher ratio, encouraging  greater parental involvement and placing a greater emphasis on early  intervention and numeracy and literacy.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in which to propose  the motion and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other  Members who are called to speak will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One amendment has been selected and published on the  Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes in which to  propose and five minutes in which to make a winding-up speech.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes that schools may choose to use an  examination as part of their entry criteria under the Minister of Education&rsquo;s  2010 guidelines; calls on the Minister of Education to re-commission the CCEA  test, she abandoned on 2 February 2009, that schools may then use for a maximum  of two years; and calls on the Executive to agree new, legally binding  guidelines for post primary transfer for use from 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that we now have an opportunity to return to  this matter, which is, without doubt, the most vexing within the education debate.  Indeed, of all the current issues before the Assembly, it is one of the most  important.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to review in detail the history of how we got  to where we are today, but I will make a few points. For the Alliance Party to  recommend a system of academic selection, even on a temporary basis, is a major  shift in its thinking &mdash; I nearly said &ldquo;shame&rdquo;. I emphasise that our basic  long-term approach is unaltered. Our commitment to end selection at age 11 is  solid, as is our preference for age 14, &agrave; la Dickson plan, as the age at which  educational choices are made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance  Party wishes to raise the standards of secondary schools to such a level that  parents will opt for them by first choice and not as second best. We have no  desire to lower the standards or destroy the ethos of any school. Indeed, it  would be completely counterproductive to raise one standard at the expense of  another.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: No,  not yet. Let me get into my stride. Come back in an hour.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are offering a short-term fix to allow all parties &mdash;  political or otherwise &mdash; to reconsider the way forward. In particular, we are  asking the Minister to revisit, in an amended form, the compromise arrangements  that she offered last year: a CCEA-formulated test based on the literacy and  numeracy components of the revised curriculum, to be available as a standard  test to all schools and all pupils.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That initiative has wide support from educationalists: they  are not unanimous, but it has wide support. We have consulted widely, and it is  fair to say that even those who do not agree have at least acknowledged the  fact that we are trying to do something to avoid the looming confrontation  caused by the Minister&rsquo;s current refusal to compromise and the threat of  independent action by the grammar-school lobby, aided, with varying degrees of  enthusiasm, by her political opponents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that if the Minister can be persuaded to run with  our proposals, the problems she had with her previous compromise offer, over  the legislative basis for the application of a test and the necessary  conditions to be attached, could be overcome. No doubt, the Chairman of the  Committee will refer to that when he rises to speak shortly. It must be clear  that no legal basis is required to commission the test: the legal basis is  required to apply the test. The Minister could give the Council for the  Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) the go-ahead this afternoon to  complete the work, which, I believe, was largely completed anyway when she last  asked it to do the same thing. Given that the Education Committee has also  asked for a compromise very close to ours, it is hard to imagine how it could  oppose this. Equally, one would think that, in the circumstances, the Executive  would not block the issue either &mdash; but who knows.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are reminded constantly that it is all about the  children. I am speaking on their behalf in appealing for common sense to  prevail.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have been asked whether the Alliance Party would be  content for grammar schools to use the test to provide 100% of their intake.  The SDLP amendment makes specific reference to that question. We do not wish  that situation to develop any more than the SDLP does, so we are suggesting a  combination of the test results and the best of the Minister&rsquo;s guidelines to  provide a balanced intake to all schools, including grammar schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We do not wish to be prescriptive about the criteria to be  applied; that is a matter for further discussion when framing the legislative  basis for setting the criteria. For that reason, although we recognise the  merits of the SDLP amendment, we want to keep the terms of our motion simple.  Therefore, we will not support the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We find ourselves in a strange position. If the House had  accepted the Minister&rsquo;s 50%, 30%, 20% proposals some months ago, or if the  Minister would now accept our proposals or the suggestions of the Committee for  Education &mdash; which are practically the same &mdash; we could make progress. Two offers  of compromise have been made at different times, but those, apparently, are  unacceptable. Currently, however, we are considering the departmental  guidelines &mdash; or our compromise &mdash; as the way forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party could work with the guidelines, but it  is abundantly clear that others cannot. The question is whether the guidelines  are enforceable. Legally, they probably are, but are we prepared to countenance  enforcement actions against schools or head teachers who allow preparation time  for grammar-school tests or allow their premises to be used in a way that  contravenes those guidelines? Will we really take legal action? What sanctions  will we apply against those head teachers? Will we cane them? Will we affect  their funding in some way? The situation is ludicrous and unnecessary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Are teachers expected to defy the advice of their unions  and suffer the wrath of parents who want their children to be prepared for,  perhaps, several different tests? Do we really want all that pressure to be  heaped on 10-year-olds? Do the Association for Quality Education and other  groups want to go down an unregulated road that is strewn with legal  minefields? I do not think so; we do not need to do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion, if accepted by the Minister, will resolve the  confusion for parents, pupils and teachers, and it will provide the Assembly  with two further years to deliver democratic consensus. There is a feeling that  that just cannot be done, but there are plenty of things around this place that  people said could not be done. People are sitting in Government together who  were &mdash; as they keep reminding us, no less so today &mdash; sworn enemies just a few  years ago, and they are reaching agreement. Sometimes they sulk for a few  months, but they get back to business. Things are being done that would have  been unheard of a few years ago, so this issue can also be resolved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We think that we have the support of large sections of the  educational establishment, including the Churches, headmasters, the general  public and the Transferor Representatives&rsquo; Council. The SDLP amendment also refers  to a group of educators to try to find a way through this situation, which  could be helpful. In fact, that is probably inevitable. However, it is the  Department that eventually has to make the decisions, which is why I am  appealing to the Minister. I do not think that I am breaking any confidence by  stating that I believe that the Catholic bishops will also broadly support what  we are doing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, for varying reasons, I believe that we will receive  the support of most of the parties that are represented here. I am under no  illusions: different agendas, ambitions and endgames are involved. However, I  do not care. If we are prepared to put our core principles on hold for the  greater good, it is reasonable to ask the rest of the parties to do the same. It  is fair enough if they have different agendas, but we can co-operate for the  next two years and try to bring some order to the situation &mdash; otherwise,  confusion and unacceptable pressure will be placed on our primary 5 and primary  6 children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To reject the motion is to reject the only route away from  chaos. Everyone involved with education, which means pretty much our entire  population, will be watching carefully to see how we deal with the situation.  Minister, it is over to you &mdash; join with us. The Minister is often quoted as  saying that it is all about the children. It is time for her to prove that she  means that. I ask her to support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: Leave out all after &ldquo;2010 guidelines&rdquo;  and insert</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;; calls on the Minister of Education to ensure the provision  of a CCEA test, as she previously proposed, for a maximum period of two years;  believes that no school should be allowed to admit its full year 8 pupil quota  using the outcomes of that test alone or using any other test; recommends the  admission criteria as outlined in the Minister&rsquo;s statement on transfer 2010 on  2 February 2009 and welcomes the first criterion as a means of ensuring that  all schools help tackle social deprivation; and further calls on the Minister  of Education to set up a new educator-led working group tasked with building a  sustainable consensus on non-selective transfer whose recommendations the  Executive and the Assembly would use as the basis for legally binding  regulations from 2011 at the latest.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. &Eacute;ir&iacute;m leis an  leas&uacute; don r&uacute;n a mholadh. The SDLP&rsquo;s position on post-primary transfer is, and  has always been, unambiguous. Since the party&rsquo;s foundation, its members have  campaigned for the abolition of the 11-plus. We believe it to be academically  unsound and socially unjust. We welcome the fact that it has been confined to  the dustbin of history. However, we cannot stand by and tolerate a situation  whereby eight years after the 11-plus was abolished, we are less than eight  months away from chaos and anarchy in the education system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP is not afraid to show leadership on the issue. We  have listened to what people have said, and we will continue to engage. At this  stage, we are all aware of the public uncertainty about the transfer issue. We  cannot afford to ignore that. It behoves us all to do everything within our  power to ensure that parents, pupils and teachers have clarity on the issue. It  is for that reason that our party has tabled the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The 2006-08 report by the chief inspector of the Education  and Training Inspectorate, which we debated earlier today, echoes the public&rsquo;s  views when it states that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The uncertainty about the practical implications of  DE&rsquo;s outlined proposals for the review of post-primary education remains a  concern for individual schools, parents and pupils.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To my mind, the Alliance Party&rsquo;s motion is somewhat unclear  about whether it seeks to support the original proposed use of the CCEA test.  To some extent, Trevor Lunn has clarified that in his speech. We were unsure  whether the motion supports the use of the test to admit a percentage of pupils  &mdash; a different percentage each year &mdash; with all children in year 3 being admitted  by application of admission criteria only, or whether it supports the use of  tests to select 100% of the intake for grammar schools. Trevor now confirms  that it supports the former, so I do not know why he cannot support our  amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Not only that, it was unclear whether the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  motion precluded the use of other tests, and we have clarified that in our  amendment. Moreover, the motion does not point towards the future. Given those  ambiguities, it was difficult for us to support the motion, which is why we  tabled the amendment. I appeal to the Alliance Party to join us in supporting  the amendment, because, as Trevor outlined, they are largely in agreement with  major parts of our amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The clear consensus is that an unregulated system is not  desirable and that an interim regulated system is needed. The SDLP amendment  offers that regulation as a short-term solution, pending agreement on a  longer-term outcome. Our party&rsquo;s amendment supports the continuation of such a  regulated system for two years, but a system that is not solely dependent on a  test.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As outlined in our policy, our party members would prefer  that transfer take place without the use of test. However, given the  exceptional prevailing circumstances, we believe that the partial use of the  CCEA test is preferable to the use of an unlimited number of other tests in an  unregulated system.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am interested to hear the Member outline what is now, presumably, SDLP  policy. Has that policy been explained to the largely middle-class parents of  Our Lady&rsquo;s Grammar School, Sacred   Heart Grammar    School, Abbey Christian Brothers&rsquo; Grammar School  and St Colman&rsquo;s College in Newry? Those parents do not support the policy that  has just been outlined.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I doubt whether those parents, whose views Mr Kennedy seems to know so  intimately, vote for his party: they are more likely to be supporters of our  party.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We know from the chief inspector&rsquo;s report &mdash; which was  debated earlier today &mdash; that many post-primary schools, particularly in the  non-selective sector, are continuing to feel the effects of demographic  decline. Enrolment figures have dropped by almost 4,000, and more than one  third of schools have fewer than 500 pupils, which is potentially disastrous.  Demographic decline is going to worsen over the next few years, which will lead  to unplanned outcomes in the form of school closures in some areas. We need to  act now before that situation occurs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The arrangements for Key Stage 4 pupils must be fully in  place by 2013 to ensure that schools can deliver the range of choice needed to  fulfil the requirements of the entitlement framework. Area-based planning needs  to continue in order to ensure that each area has an opportunity to shape its  future educational provision. That does not mean a one-size-fits-all solution or  one that is imposed on local areas from on high; it means a solution that best  suits local circumstances, whether in Newry, which Mr Kennedy mentioned, Omagh,  Derry, Lisburn, Enniskillen or anywhere else.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The chief inspector put his finger on one important aspect  of the public pulse on this issue, namely the uncertainty about the practical  implication of the Department&rsquo;s proposals. People want to know what the  outworking of those proposals will be for their local area, and it is only  through the area-based planning process that they will see what those local  outcomes will be. That is why it is so important for the process to continue  and for local plans to be agreed in each sector and between the various  sectors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We can build parental confidence by telling parents what  their local schools will be, how those schools will co-operate and collaborate  and how their children will access those schools. In addition to the immediate  problem of transfer in 2010, there is lack of knowledge and information about  how education will be delivered in each local area in the years that will  follow, which is compounding the existing uncertainty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If parents are to have a degree of confidence in the  system, they need to know the results of area-based planning and be able to see  &mdash; in the words of the chief inspector &mdash; what &ldquo;practical implications&rdquo; the  Department&rsquo;s proposals will have for children in their local area. The SDLP  believes, and proposes in the amendment, that an educator-led working group  will be well placed to find sustainable consensus that will lead to a permanent  solution for the future. That proposal and, indeed, all the main aspects of the  amendment, have support in the wider educational community, and that will be  confirmed in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that we need change in our education  system in order to meet the demands of the global economy, particularly during  the economic downturn. We need change in order to address the shortcomings so  clearly outlined during the debate on the chief inspector&rsquo;s report. We need  change to tackle the long tail of underachievement and the large number of  pupils who leave our schools without proper qualifications. We need to bring  certainty to pupils, parents, teachers and schools, and the proposals in our  amendment will help to do that. I commend the amendment to the House and ask  Members to support it. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  rise to speak as Chairperson of the Committee for Education. The debate is  timely for two reasons: it provides an opportunity for the Committee to put on  record its position on the unregulated system of transfer that is before us  and, more importantly, it provides Members of the House with a last-minute  opportunity to give a clear and unequivocal message to the Minister of  Education so that primary-6 pupils, parents and teachers are not subjected to  further unnecessary uncertainty and stress.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Immediately after the Minister of Education&rsquo;s statement to  the House on 2 February 2009 on the transfer 2010 guidance, the Committee  requested that she come to a meeting of the Committee as soon as possible to  discuss her proposed guidance. Having received no reply, the Committee  discussed a widespread and growing concern about an unregulated transfer system  at its meeting on 18 February, and agreed to write to the Minister. The  Committee&rsquo;s letter of 20 February to the Minister &mdash; and a follow-up letter of 2  March, written after the Committee had received confirmation that the Minister  was prepared to appear before it &mdash; made crystal clear the extent of the  Committee&rsquo;s concern about an unregulated transfer system. There was a consensus  within the Committee that that was the least desirable outcome for children,  parents and schools. Both letters are available on the Committee&rsquo;s website,  under the heading &ldquo;Committee Responses&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those letters are important and are central to today&rsquo;s  motion because they set out the Committee&rsquo;s proposal to the Minister to  reconsider the use of her own CCEA test as an interim compromise arrangement.  The letter provided evidence of widespread concerns over an unregulated system,  and asked the Minister for full and urgent consideration of the core principle  of using a regulated test for an interim period, which would not distort the  primary curriculum. I stress to Members that no other conditions were attached  to the Committee&rsquo;s proposal. Clearly, the detail of an interim solution  required further work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, just 30 minutes before the Committee met the  Minister of Education on 10 March, the Committee received the Minister&rsquo;s  briefing note for the meeting. At the second bullet point, it stated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I will not agree to the Committee&rsquo;s request.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The note went on to say that the CCEA test had been  cancelled, and that it was commissioned as a contingency measure. After nearly  two hours of robust discussion, as Chairperson of the Committee, I asked the  Minister of Education whether she would allow the Committee to flesh out  proposals. I also put to her a final question. The Hansard report shows that  all parties represented on the Committee stated their positions on the  Committee&rsquo;s proposal. My question was as follows:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Is it your intention to reflect on those  considerations, or are you telling the Committee that you will not consider its  request as outlined in the letter of 20 February?&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s answer is all important to today&rsquo;s debate:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I always reflect on everything that the Committee  says to me. I have been clear about Transfer 2010 &mdash; it is the Department&rsquo;s  policy. There will not be a CCEA test. We have to move forward now under  Transfer 2010 in the interests of all our children.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Chairperson of the Committee for Education, I shall end  by listing the evidence of concerns about an unregulated system, which we put  to the Minister in the Committee&rsquo;s letter of 20 February. Those are &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I am deeply concerned that the views of the  Education Committee are not being fairly reflected by the Chairperson in this  debate. I ask you to examine the Member&rsquo;s speech because it does not reflect  the Education Committee&rsquo;s stated position. No position has been agreed by the  Education Committee on this matter.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I certainly did not call the Member as Chairperson of the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The Member has consistently referred to himself as Chairperson of the Education  Committee. He is speaking as Chairperson of the Education Committee, and I  contend that his remarks do not reflect the agreed position of the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I will look at the Hansard report, and I will come back to the Member directly,  or to the House. To clarify that point: from the Chair&rsquo;s point of view, I  certainly did not call him as the Chairperson of the Committee for Education.  He may have reflected that himself as a Member.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker; I made it abundantly clear. It seems as though some  Members have difficulty with their hearing. I am speaking as the Chairperson of  the Committee for Education. The Member is quite entitled to raise his concerns.  If he is questioning the accuracy of the Hansard report, the accuracy of the  letter that was sent to the Minister of Education &mdash; and the Member was present  when that letter was approved &mdash; or if he has a difficulty with his own  intelligence, that is his problem not mine.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  On a point of order. The Member has just confirmed that he is speaking as  Chairperson of the Committee for Education. There is no agreed position from  the Education Committee in relation to this matter. There is no agreed  statement from the Education Committee on this matter. I maintain that the position  that is being given by the Member is inaccurate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  As I said to the Member earlier, let me look at the Hansard report and I will  come back to you directly, or to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. Obviously this is an issue that has caused grave concern  &mdash; and I speak now not as the Chairperson of the Committee for Education, but as  a Member. However, obviously, I am glad that the Minister &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Will  the Member draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  am just glad that the Minister of Education finds this issue so funny. Well, it  is not funny whenever she has &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Well, I will say this, Mr Speaker: it is not funny for the Minister of  Education, who allows a situation to develop &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  The Minister said that she will not continue with academic selection. We will  see by the end of this week, when other statements are made, as to whether that  is still her stated position.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I must insist that the Member takes his seat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Mr Storey has confirmed that he was speaking  as Chairperson of the Committee for Education. I would like to place on record  that in the letter of 20 February, from the Committee to the Minister on the  issue of CCEA tests, I expressed the reservations that our party has on that  issue. I said that we feared that it would become a permanent fixture, and I  reiterated that point at the Education Committee&rsquo;s meeting on 10 March. I just  want to record our party&rsquo;s stance on that issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order. I have said so many times in the House that I would prefer it if  Committee business was not discussed on the Floor of the Chamber. I have made  that absolutely clear on many occasions. Whatever happens within a Committee  should stay within a Committee. It should not come onto the Floor of this  Assembly for any debate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom labhairt i gcoinne an  r&uacute;in agus an leasaithe. I am against the motion and the proposed amendment. It  is worth noting that among the letters to the Minister &mdash; which have been so  referred to in the debate &mdash; was a letter from a principal in Lisburn, speaking  against academic selection, upon which the Chairperson of the Committee for  Education failed to reflect.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  No, I will not give way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Is there an agreed position in the House on the unregulated  system, I wonder? I have taken a leaf out of Mr McCausland&rsquo;s book and delved  deep into the libraries of this institution, into the dusty alcoves, and found  many an interesting speech, which, I suspect, will not have me thrown out, but  I will repeat it. These are interesting words:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I think that there&rsquo;s not a stalemate and let&rsquo;s dispel  this myth that somehow if we went into an unregulated system that the wheels  would fall off the educational cart, that&rsquo;s not the case. I have every  confidence in the educational system, in the teachers in that system who have  had to take, I have to say, a huge amount of change over the years.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are not my words, but those of Mr Storey, speaking in  favour of an unregulated system, if I am quoting him correctly, and I am quoting  him correctly &#8213; from &lsquo;Stormont Live&rsquo; on 21 December 2008.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  No.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also find it interesting that the Alliance Party and the  SDLP, which have again stated in the Chamber that they are opposed to academic  selection, bring forward motions which enshrine academic selection in our  future. The SDLP tells us that, since its foundation, it has been opposed to,  and campaigned against, academic selection. That is very admirable indeed; but  it is decision time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is time to stand up and be counted on the issue, because  for 40 years &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  No.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those who support the grammar-school system have got off  the hook on every occasion. Forty years ago when the SDLP was formed, many people  were lobbying to have academic selection ended, because, in the words of the  SDLP, it is &ldquo;socially unjust and academically unsound&rdquo;. Why, in 2009, are we  talking about continuing for another two years with a system that a majority of  people accept is wrong? The SDLP is really saying that it wants to continue  with it for another two years, when it has already continued for 40 years from  1967.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s watch, the system will not continue. The  state will no longer sponsor academic selection in any way, and we will not  allow the small minority of schools to dictate to the majority of schools how  the education system should be run.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  No.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It will not happen on our watch.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On many occasions, I have listened to and debated at length  with the DUP on academic selection. I remain somewhat bewildered about why that  party supports it. I do not understand why it brought the issue of academic  selection into the constitutional negotiations at St   Andrews. Where was the demand in the unionist community to bring  that matter to St Andrews? I do not remember  marches, protests or any sort of demand from any community or sector to bring  such an issue to St Andrews. The DUP brought  the matter to St Andrews &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The DUP got crumbs off the desk of the British Government.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  No.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP has achieved a political stalemate on the matter.  It believed that it had secured the future of academic selection. It may have  done so in the legislation somewhere, but it has not done so in terms of the  Department of Education funding or supporting it. We have to move beyond  selection. In the earlier debate, Miss McIlveen outlined the fact that  education underachievement is most prevalent in deprived working-class areas.  We all have such areas in our constituencies, so why did the DUP make academic  selection one of the issues at constitutional negotiations?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In many cases, the very reason for education  underachievement is that children are told at age 11 that they are a failure.  There is no point in supporting children at the age of three with extra  resources if, when they get to 11, they are told that they are a failure  because of two one-hour tests. In the future weeks and months, the pressure  should be applied to the small minority of schools who insist on continuing  with academic selection. They should be told that the game is over.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I rise to bring a bit of calm and decorum to this overheated House. I have a  vision. I see a runaway train, driven by the Minister of Education, hurtling  towards Cassandra crossing. The Minister of Education has taken away the bridge  and said not to worry because the train will jump the chasm anyway. Have I ever  heard anything as ridiculous in my life?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I heard John O&rsquo;Dowd pontificate about failure, I was  struck by the abject failure of the House to get any possible solution.  Compromise was mentioned, but there is no such thing as compromise in this  place. The Minister of Education said that she wanted to see leadership. When  one has leadership with no followers, one gets dictatorship. This is a  dictatorship; it is going nowhere and it will bring this place down. The  Minister should think about the political consequences of her action.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for giving way &mdash; I am not sure which Member, but I  am grateful anyway. Does the Member agree that, sadly, the Minister of  Education is now the Minister of mediocrity?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I cannot agree more. This is about mediocrity and about make-do and mend. This  is not about the future or about vision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is a disgrace. The Minister of Education will leave  her legacy, on which people will look back. I am not sure whether Members have  seen the film called &lsquo;The Age of Stupid&rsquo;. Now is the age of stupid: the age of  inability to find compromise and to provide genuine leadership.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are in the process of bringing out facts and figures.  People refer to &ldquo;a privileged few&rdquo;. Let me say that 42% of children attend  grammar schools. That is not a privileged few. A significant number of children  attend secondary modern schools. They have a perfectly good, fantastic  education and love their schools. They are not a privileged few. However, 25%  of the school-aged population has problems with educational underachievement.  That has nothing to do with the 11-plus; it has everything to do with social  deprivation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. One of the previous Members to speak said that  there is no demand for academic selection. Is it not the case that a survey  carried out by the Member&rsquo;s predecessor as Minister of Education, and who is  from the same party, found that 64% of parents who responded wanted the  retention of academic selection? That nails the myth that there is no desire  among the public for academic selection.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Absolutely: Mr Weir makes a good point very well. It answers precisely Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s position.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not read from notes often in the Chamber. However, I  was given some notes, which, when I read them, I thought were good. I have,  therefore, decided to share a few of them. One issue that they raise is that  since the Minister has taken up office, she has, unfortunately, presided over a  dysfunctional and ill-thought-out set of reforms that have caused much angst,  confusion and even anger in the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is time for the Minister to adopt a different, less  abrasive style, like mine. It is time for a new period of sensible consensus to  emerge on post-primary transfer. That will not be easy. However, it is the  Assembly&rsquo;s duty to try to do more. It is on the record that the Ulster Unionist  Party, although it recognises why grammar schools have set out their own  entrance tests, does not believe that that is a sustainable basis for transfer  into the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The claims of victory that come from certain quarters  appear ludicrous to parents, children and teachers who face educational chaos.  The Minister must realise that if she continues on her current course, parents,  teachers and, above all, children will suffer. In reality, we, politicians,  suffer little. We can have fun with our little political rivalries and  postures. However, children and the public will hold us to account.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is sensible and will give the Assembly, the  Minister and the Executive the vital breathing space that they need to move  forward with some form of consensus. Make no mistake: unless everyone agrees,  nothing happens in Northern    Ireland. To that end, I welcome the recent  input of the three main Protestant churches. They want a sustainable solution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My party also accepts that the 11-plus has had its day; it  was designed for a different time. In the past, my party argued for the test&rsquo;s  limited retention in order to ensure some continuity and balance in order to  deliver schools from chaos. However, it is now happy to support the  recommissioning of the CCEA test, which the Minister unwisely abandoned. There  will be serious issues with regard to its design and piloting, but the Assembly  must come up with something.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Even at this late hour, it is within the Minister of  Education&rsquo;s power to prevent the education system from falling further into  chaos. She can set aside her ideological prejudice and put children&rsquo;s welfare  first. She can support the motion&rsquo;s principles.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My party supports the substantive motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I, too, support the motion. I welcome the fact that colleagues in the Alliance  Party have brought it forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first part of the motion reminds Members:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;That this Assembly notes that schools may choose to  use an examination as part of their entry criteria&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is the situation, which, I am aware, is  difficult for some members of Sinn F&eacute;in to acknowledge and accept. However, it  is a reality. They have not managed to abolish academic selection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">They have failed utterly and miserably to do that. That is  because during the discussions at St Andrews,  the DUP addressed the issue of selection, and the current provision whereby it  is possible to select children for a grammar school on the basis of academic  criteria was retained. Therefore, that provision will not be given away, and  Sinn F&eacute;in is impotent in that it is incapable of taking it away.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">John O&rsquo;Dowd told the House &mdash; very forcibly &mdash; that a  minority should not dictate to a majority. I am glad to hear that. However, the  point was made that survey after survey has made it clear that the majority of  people in Northern Ireland  favour the retention of an appropriate form of academic selection. In one  survey, even a majority of Sinn F&eacute;in supporters said that they favoured the  retention of academic selection. Therefore, it is not a case of a minority  dictating to a majority. The position is absolutely clear: the majority of  people in Northern Ireland  support the DUP view, which is shared by the Ulster Unionist Party.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion recognises the reality, rather than the  unreality and the pretend world in which Sinn F&eacute;in wants to live. It calls on  the Minister to recommission the CCEA test &mdash; which she abandoned on 2 February  &mdash; in order that schools may use it for a maximum of two years. In other words,  there should be a two-year breathing space that will provide an opportunity  both for proper debate and real discussion and for calm reflection on the  issue, rather than the confrontational and bullish approach that we have seen  the Minister and her party demonstrate. I remember her party leader&rsquo;s comment  to the effect that the Minister&rsquo;s role is to implement Sinn F&eacute;in policy. The  Minister is trying to implement a policy, but it is one that she is incapable  of implementing because of the provisions of the St Andrews Agreement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  OK; why not?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Is the Member telling us that after two years of quiet reflection, the DUP will  agree to abolish academic selection?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member has an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention, because it gives me an extra minute in  which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The key point is that reflection is not about predetermined  outcomes; it is about consideration. The fact is that the DUP is prepared to  sit down and have a proper discussion, but not one that involves the  head-to-head confrontation in which the Minister has indulged over what we were  told earlier has been the past two years. She has indulged in a  confrontational, bullying approach through which she has told the House that  she is the Minister and that that is that. That is not the way in which to get  the consensus that we need on the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the moment, there is no consensus even in the academic  world. I could speak to one academic in the field of education in Queen&rsquo;s  University who will give me one view, but another in that sphere will give me a  contrary view. The Minister tells us that everybody except Sinn F&eacute;in is out of  step. However, that is not the case. She does not recognise the reality of the  legislative position or the reality of the variety of views on the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the years, there has been no proper discussion of the  matter. If we were given the opportunity to have that interim period, some  security for parents and children would be provided, there could be debate on  the matter, and the issue could progress from the current stand-off. However,  an unregulated selection system is in place, regardless of whether the Minister  likes it. I acknowledge that it is not the best system, but it is much better  than her other option of having no selection. The Minister has acknowledged  that a CCEA test that would not have an impact on the teaching of the revised  curriculum could be introduced. Therefore, there is no justification for the  Minister&rsquo;s position and every justification for supporting the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta labhairt ar an r&uacute;n  agus ar an leas&uacute; inniu.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to be able to contribute to the debate on the  motion and the amendment, although I will be unable to support either.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the Alliance Party&rsquo;s proposal is a complete  departure from that party&rsquo;s policy position. I listened carefully to the  explanation and rationale that was offered by the proposer of the motion, but  the proposal lacks any coherence or detail on how any interim or compromise  position would work in practice in relation to grammar-school intake. For  example, the absence of any reference to social deprivation fatally undermines  the proposal.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I would rather get into the argument, if that is OK. I will see how I get on  and will, if I can, leave some space for an intervention.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The absence of any reference to social deprivation  seriously undermines the entire rationale for dealing with the inequities that  exist in the current system, and to argue for preserving that system, in many  ways, betrays that party&rsquo;s position.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I took the trouble to read the Alliance Party&rsquo;s position;  it supports the abolition of the 11-plus, and it argues that schools should not  be allowed to use academic ability to decide who should be given a place. That  party&rsquo;s policy is also that children should progress to study a common  middle-school curriculum for three years and argues that existing schools could  provide what it describes as a middle-school education; that is an important  point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The policy position of the Alliance Party is also,  importantly, that the election of a particular educational route should be  deferred until the age of 14. Those views are the basis of consensus and  agreement. It is regrettable that the Alliance Party should depart from that. I  am reminded of the day that the Alliance Party Members re-designated themselves  in the Assembly to provide support to the Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP. I  also recall that, in relation to that episode, the Alliance Party promised to  never again abandon its principles; I suppose that this is a case of &ldquo;d&eacute;j&agrave; vu  all over again&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  No. Please allow me to develop the argument.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will explain my opposition to the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment.  Although the middle section of the amendment is drawn directly from the  guidelines produced by the Department, the opening statement sits curiously  against the SDLP position, as defined by Dominic Bradley 18 months ago. He  described the compromise proposals as a clear climb down from the Minister&rsquo;s  stated position on academic selection. He railed:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Minister has caved in to pressure from those who  are opposed to reform.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He also said that bringing forward compromise  proposals was:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the thin end of the wedge for the continuation of the  11-Plus into the future&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  No. I hope that I am annoying you, because I am quoting the facts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s amendment can only be described as yet another  U-turn, and a betrayal of the mandate to abolish academic selection that the  SDLP, since its inception, has sought from the electorate.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Before I was interrupted, I was making the point that the SDLP is abandoning  its mandate. We heard some reference today to that party&rsquo;s consistency; where  is the consistency? Some people will see that party&rsquo;s position as contradictory  and illogical, and that is probably the kindest remark that could be made about  the SDLP argument that we heard today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to state that the process in which we are  now involved is a one of necessary change &mdash; it is not change for the sake of  change. It is a process of change with the sole aim of developing and building  on the successes and the good, strong points of the current system, while  addressing the serious inequalities and weaknesses that also, undoubtedly,  exist.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What I have heard from across the Floor is that all parties  are articulating a desire to have an education system that delivers and  produces the sort of educational outcomes that we need, as a society, in order  to face the challenges that will emerge in the years ahead.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: If Members have private conversations to hold, please hold them  outside the Chamber.</p>    
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  It looks like this council is still trapped in groundhog day on this issue. It  should be clear to all of us by now that it simply does not matter what Dominic  Bradley and Mr Lunn say about post-primary transfer &mdash; or whether Basil McCrea  takes a heart attack in the middle of the debate &mdash; the Minister will simply  ignore us.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Which council is it?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  We can continue to put forward motions, but she will still pay no attention  whatsoever, because they do not fit in with her party political agenda.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP has been very clear on this issue. We fought to  retain academic selection: it is what parents want, and it is clear that it is  what more schools and teachers across the communities are willing to now say that  they want, despite the bullying tactics of the Minister, who has now left the  Chamber. The Department &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member withdraw the remarks that have caused the Minister of Education  to walk out of the Assembly? <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  Indeed. Despite the Minister&rsquo;s bullying tactics, the Department and her friends  in INTO, it will not make a lot of difference.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We believe that academic selection is best for our  children&rsquo;s education and for having an effective and well-equipped workforce  for the future of Northern    Ireland. On that basis, it is obvious that  the DUP cannot accept the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment. I had to laugh when I read that one  of the political bloggers &mdash; a former SDLP special adviser &mdash; had suggested that  the amendment represented an attempt by the SDLP to seek to break the 11-plus  deadlock. Unfortunately, if this amendment is the best that the SDLP can do  then I am disappointed at its lack of imagination and understanding of the  position of the two unionist parties and of the legislative reality that is in  place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Surely the SDLP knows that the DUP will not back the  amendment, as the retention of selective transfer remains a key part of our  education policy. The Minister &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  No; I have plenty to say. The Minister, Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP must accept the  fact that academic selection is staying and that nothing can be done without  the agreement of those on the Benches on this side of the House. Only when that  is accepted can we move forward. The problem that Northern Ireland faces time and  again is that some parties work towards aspirations rather than dealing with  political realities. Given that academic selection has been retained through legislation,  it would have been a much more productive use of the SDLP&rsquo;s time to put forward  a proposal incorporating that fact in a way that would be of benefit to  children across Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In February, the Minister told us to think of the children.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I have plenty to say.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We do think of the children; we also think of the education  system, parents and society in general. We think about what the Minister is  doing to children, parents and schools through her intransigence. We think  about the emotional strains that are being placed on families throughout Northern Ireland  while the Minister plays party political games with our children&rsquo;s futures for  some ideological aspiration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The parties should be working together to formulate a  system of academic selection that addresses the flaws in the old 11-plus. I am  not wearing rose-coloured glasses and thinking about the wonderful system that  it was; but its problems can be addressed, and the Minister must remove her own  blinkers on the matter. She previously said that the CCEA could produce a test;  if that is the case, then it should be done. I do not agree with claims of  chaos and scaremongering about entrance tests, but I do feel that the current  unregulated system is not ideal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP has always been clear on that point; we previously  proposed that a CCEA test &mdash; to agreed specifications &mdash; should be set for a  period of up to three years, and that such testing could and should be carried  out in primary schools. That period could be used to settle on a long-term  method for transfer, and for any new system to allow for the continuation of  academic selection. Any replacement test would have to address criticisms of a  high-stakes nature; susceptibility to coaching; poor differentiation of  results, and the time delay in waiting for results. Such problems are not  insurmountable, given the progress of technology.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP had also proposed the establishment of an agreed  panel of experts with experience of transfer procedures, which would advise the  Department of Education and the Assembly on the development of the best  arrangements for us in Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister chose not to listen and not to seek consensus;  she continues to plough her lone furrow &mdash; and stuff the consequences. I back  the Alliance Party&rsquo;s motion &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I fear that the Minister will once again ignore the will of the Assembly, the  will of parents and the common will of our children.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  In addressing the motion, it is interesting to reflect on where we have come  from. On 10 November 2008, the Assembly passed an Ulster Unionist Party motion,  which stated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Education  to end the uncertainty facing parents and teachers of children in Primary 6 by  continuing with the existing post-primary transfer test until a replacement is  designed and piloted by CCEA.&rdquo; &mdash;<span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; "> [Official Report, Vol 35, No 1, p4, col 2].</span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That resolution is guidance. Of course, the Minister  recently issued her own guidance, for which schools must have regard; they  cannot disregard it. That means that a board of governors can simply put the  guidance on the agenda of a meeting, read it, have regard to it, decide that  the guidance is not for that school and then move on. The guidance that the  House gave the Minister last year, however, is slightly different. The Minister  is subject to the ministerial code, which contains a Pledge of Office.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 8 May 2007, the Minister told the House:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Yes, I am willing to take up the office of Minister  of Education, and I affirm the terms of the Pledge of Office as set out in  schedule 4 to the Northern    Ireland Act 1998.&rdquo; &mdash;<span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; "> [Official Report, Bound  Volume 22, p7, col 2]</span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Paragraph (f) of the Pledge of Office states that  the Minister affirms:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to support, and to act in accordance with, all  decisions of the Executive Committee and Assembly;&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Is the Minister, therefore, in breach of the Pledge  of Office, and how many votes will the Minister ignore before she is finally  willing to engage?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member join me in considering the supposed advantages of the St  Andrews Agreement that there would be no solo runs by any Minister and that  academic selection would no longer be an issue?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I agree with the Member&rsquo;s sentiments. Unfortunately, we are now in educational  gridlock, which is in nobody&rsquo;s interest.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The close similarity between the motion in today&rsquo;s Order  Paper and our motion of last year means that my colleagues and I are happy to  endorse the motion; however, we cannot support the SDLP amendment. It is too  prescriptive, particularly as it appears to rule out entirely a role for  academic criteria in a post-primary transfer process. If there is to be  consensus, it must ensure that concern for social justice is united with, and  not set in false opposition to, concern for academic excellence. The amendment,  although well intentioned, unfortunately fails that test.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Briefly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Does the Member recall that Mr Lunn clarified the Alliance Party&rsquo;s position  when he outlined the terms of the motion? He said that the motion is not  intended to be test-dependent alone and that the Alliance Party also wants  non-academic criteria to be contained in the guidance. Therefore, any party  that supports the motion will be supporting the view of the Alliance Party as  Mr Lunn expressed clearly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I accept the Member&rsquo;s point; however, that is not established explicitly in the  motion. It may be implicit, and that might have been the intention of the  motion, but when and if the motion passes it will not include an explicit  reference to such a system, unlike the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate over post-primary transfer has been ongoing for  well over a decade, perhaps longer. If the Minister and her party still do not  recognise that consensus and give and take are the only ways forward, I am left  wondering whether they want our education system to be thrown into complete and  utter chaos as they act out their bizarre Che Guevara fantasies of class  strife. Sometimes, I think that the Minister&rsquo;s views were fashioned in the  jungles of Colombia.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we are where we are. The motion is reasonable,  because it attempts to guide the Minister out of the hole that she has dug for  herself. The Minister&rsquo;s cancellation of the CCEA test that she commissioned has  left our education system in a mess. Restarting the process to develop that test  on a short-term basis is the only realistic way out of that position and would  provide clarity for schools, parents and children. The unregulated system that  the Minister has left us with is unsustainable &mdash; she should accept that and  seek to improve the situation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  The terms of the motion provides that the Minister should offer a short-term  solution while the Executive get to grips with the issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I support the amendment. The SDLP totally supports the abolition of the  11-plus, which is socially unjust and academically unsound, irrespective of  some of the comments that we heard during the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The 11-plus can segregate and be the cause of much undue  stress for pupils, teachers and parents. Our amendment allows for the end of  the 11-plus and, essentially, the end of academic selection. It will also allow  for an early resolution and a more unified way forward for the transfer of  children from primary to post-primary education. There is much confusion about  that issue, which has been caused by the bickering and the political point  scoring over the past year or so. It is time that we made the scenario  educator-led. After all, the educators will be thrust into the middle of  whatever system is eventually put into practice, and it is they who will work  to teach and mould the children who may well be the high achievers of tomorrow.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is essential that children, parents and teachers alike  are given some sort of solace amid all the confusion. There needs to be a  general test set by CCEA, and no matter where schools are in the league table,  they should not be allowed to meet their intake quota from the result of that,  or any other, test. That will give all children the chance to excel.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  No, I am sorry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We agree with the first criterion referred to in transfer  2010, which should, in essence, help to tackle social deprivation. However, we  have a concern about area-based criteria in situations where there are  post-primary schools sited in the heart of residential areas that are graded as  being socially deprived. That is particularly relevant in my constituency.  Under the Minister&rsquo;s proposals, children from those areas will be forced into  schools in which the bulk of pupils are classed as underachievers and linked to  social deprivation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We commend the amendment to Sinn F&eacute;in and ask its Members  to support it if they are serious about the abolition of academic selection.  Are they going to sit back and allow the top schools to create their own  selection process that cannot be regulated, which will allow them to take a  carte blanche approach, do as they wish and answer to no one?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  No; I am sorry, I refused before.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With our amendment, there can still be some control, and  guidelines can be issued for all schools to adhere to. Within the past hour, we  were discussing the chief inspector&rsquo;s report, which outlined a mixed bag of  standards and quality through primary and post-primary education. If we cannot  sort out the mess around academic selection, I dread the next report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the Minister to listen to the people and commission  a standard test for the next few years to allow an educator-led working group  to create a non-selective transfer procedure that can be used as a basis for a  legally bound regulation. The Minister should give the educational  professionals the chance to succeed where political footballers have evidently  failed. Our children and the educators are those who suffer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is time for it to end. We cannot and should not expect  the educators, the children or their parents to go forward with a deregulated  system; it is not fair.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the amendment.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I  acknowledge the support of Trevor Lunn and the Alliance Party for the ending of  academic selection. However, I am disappointed that they and he are not  following through on their party policy on the matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also disappointed that the Education Committee has  failed to reach a consensus to date. I note that the Chairperson of the  Committee is attempting to misrepresent the Committee, as he did previously  when I appeared before them, when he claimed to speak for all of the members  when making statements. It was obvious that he did not speak for everyone, as  my colleague John O&rsquo;Dowd has stated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is yet another attempt to block or slow the  process of change that I have set in motion. That process is designed to  provide a first-class education for all of our children. The system that the  proposers of the motion wish to keep in place was a failed one, and I have  already made it clear that the status quo is not an option.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I stated to the Education Committee two weeks ago, last  year&rsquo;s test was the last 11-plus. That system was designed 60 years ago, and it  is clearly not fit for the modern world. Not only was it outdated, but it was  fundamentally wrong, based on academic apartheid, and it condemned the majority  of our children as failures. In my opinion, no child is a failure. For that  reason alone, there will be no further state-sponsored testing at 11 years old.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Cur chuige neamhoiri&uacute;nach agus neamhleor is ea an roghn&uacute; acad&uacute;il;  cur chuige &eacute;ag&oacute;rach amach is amach at&aacute; ann. T&aacute; c&oacute;ras oideachais uainn at&aacute;  bunaithe ar an bp&aacute;iste agus a fhreastala&iacute;onn ar riachtanais shaol an lae inniu.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Academic selection is an inappropriate and inadequate approach  to education. It is also unjust and fundamentally wrong. We need an education  system that is child-centred, and meets the needs of our modern world. I am  anxious to see change that delivers for all of our children, and allows each of  them to develop their own individual strengths and talents &mdash; a system that  builds on the individual strengths that every single one of our children  possesses, whatever that strength is. The singular focus on academic ability  must be replaced by a focus on all talents and aptitudes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the absence of regulations, I have issued guidance. The  policy of the Department of Education is transfer 2010. Schools will be  obliged, in law, to have regard for the guidance. On equality grounds, and also  because of risks of dysfunction, the guidance strongly recommends that schools  do not use academic admissions criteria. If a school chooses to do so, it must  provide for itself the robust assessment mechanism and procedures that such  criteria require.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, and more importantly, the Department strongly  recommends that academic admissions criteria are not used because of the  fundamental inequality and injustice of academic selection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That brings me to the second part of the motion, which  calls on me to recommission the CCEA test to enable schools to use it for a  maximum of two years. I proposed the test for three years, not two. I proposed  a legislative framework accompanying a test that would limit its use across  that three-year period, thus phasing out academic selection. That would have  been a transition with a very clear outcome, ending the inequality that is  academic selection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I sought engagement on that proposal over a period of eight  months. That opportunity was not taken up, and, because of that failure, and  the blocking of discussion on two occasions by the DUP, I took the decision to  move on. We are where we are.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People say that I have no power, but the 11-plus is gone  for ever, and I welcome and celebrate that. The amendment contains elements  that are helpful, notably in their support of the free school meals criterion,  and other criteria recommended by the guidance published by my Department on 2  February 2009. However, I find it strange that an approach is being proposed  that was condemned as a climbdown last year. My colleague Mitchel McLaughlin  has stated that better than I can. The song &lsquo;Blowin&rsquo; in the Wind&rsquo; comes to  mind.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment proposes another working group, as if Burns,  Gallagher, Costello and the non-selective systems that dominate the PISA tables  have not told us enough already.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. When the Minister makes political  comments about the SDLP, is she speaking as a member of Sinn F&eacute;in or as the  Minister of Education in the four-party mandatory coalition?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I made it clear when I called the Minister to speak that I had  called the Minister of Education.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Speaking as the  Minister of Education, I will not reinstate the failed system for two more  years. Many of those who are seeking interim arrangements are merely seeking an  extension of the status quo.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Agus sin an f&aacute;th nach mbeidh s&iacute;neadh ar an tesist teipthe,  n&oacute; n&iacute; dh&eacute;anfadh sin ach p&aacute;ist&iacute; at&aacute; faoi mh&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste eacnama&iacute;ochta a chur faoi  dh&aacute; bhliain eile den roghn&uacute; s&oacute;isialta agus an neamhionannas a bhaineann leis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me be clear about why there will be no extension of the  status quo. It would mean two more years of economically disadvantaged children  suffering the inequality of social selection.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I will not. How did the 11-plus serve this year&rsquo;s admissions  process? For admissions in the 2008-09 school year: 77 out of 135 children in  Holywood&rsquo;s four primary schools transferred into a grammar school; in the seven  primary schools serving the Malone Road area, 214 out of 235 children  transferred into a grammar school; in the two primary schools serving the  Stranmillis area, 62 out of 93 children transferred into a grammar school.  However, in the three schools that largely serve the Sandy Row area, 11 out of  79 children transferred into a grammar school; in the three primary schools  that largely serve the Shankill area, 10 out of 104 children transferred to a  grammar school; in the seven schools serving the Falls area, the figure was 49  out of 284. Members must represent their constituencies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Two more years of the status quo would mean two more years  of appalling figures, which are clear indicators of profound and damaging  inequality. Do the proposers of the motion want me to continue with that  socio-economic determinism? Are they really urging me to maintain an admissions  process that, with grim certainty, leads to the appalling statistic that,  although one in four children in non-grammar schools is entitled to free school  meals, the ratio in grammar schools is one in 17?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What would two more years of the status quo mean for  primary schools? Do the Members who tabled the motion recognise the fact that  they are urging me to allow the continued distortion of teaching in primary  schools, as normal lessons are abandoned in order to put children through  practice papers in preparation for a test? Some schools begin conditioning at  P5. However, those who do not take the test &mdash; one third of all children &mdash; are  left out of preparations and are, therefore, in danger of losing interest and  falling behind in achieving basic levels of literacy and numeracy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although 10-year-old children in Europe and the rest of  Ireland &mdash; and in every other part of the world &mdash; improve their literacy and numeracy  skills, learn languages and participate in drama and sport during the next two  years, the Members who tabled the motion want our children to be prepared for a  test.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What would two more years of the status quo mean for  children who attend non-grammar schools? <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I shall tell Members what it would mean for children in  Fermanagh. There are 14 post-primary schools in Fermanagh, four of which are  grammar schools and 10 of which are secondary schools. Pupil numbers in  Fermanagh have fallen to such a degree that its four grammar schools now  educate half of the county&rsquo;s post-primary schoolchildren. The other 10  non-grammar schools educate the remaining half. Consequently, one quarter of  the desks in the 10 non-grammar schools are empty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of the children who attend those non-grammar schools, 20&middot;3  % are entitled to free school meals. Those 10 schools educate 109 children who  are in receipt of a statement of special educational needs. In contrast, the  four grammar schools are full, and 7&middot;1% of their children are entitled to free  school meals. Only nine of their children are in receipt of a statement of  special educational needs. Thanks to the 11-plus test and the selection  process, Fermanagh has a fundamentally divided post-primary school system, in which  10 schools absorb all the area&rsquo;s various challenges.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">An bhfuilimid ag iarraidh dh&aacute; bhliain eile den ch&oacute;ras sin a  bheith ann do ph&aacute;ist&iacute; Fhear Manach? T&aacute; an rud c&eacute;anna le feice&aacute;il i mB&eacute;al  Feirste, i nDoire agus in &aacute;iteanna eile. An &eacute; sin an c&oacute;ras at&aacute; molt&oacute;ir&iacute; an r&uacute;in  ag iarraidh a bheith ann go cionn dh&aacute; bhliain eile?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Do we want two more years of that for the children of  Fermanagh? The same can be observed in Belfast,  in Derry and elsewhere throughout the North of  Ireland. Is that the system in which supporters of the motion would like to  continue?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have heard suggestions that the Catholic Church proposals  may contain a request for the Department to recommission the test as an interim  measure for a set period of years before academic selection would end after  some future debate. Any attempt to construct another test would, in my view, be  totally contrary to the principles of social justice to which the Catholic  Church is publicly committed. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: It would be in conflict with the policy of the whole Catholic  sector, which is to move away from the current process of academic selection to  a more just, modern and fit-for-purpose system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The third and final part of the motion calls on the  Executive to agree new, legally binding guidelines for post-primary transfer  for use from 2011. I sought to do just that. Indeed, the commission for the  CCEA test &mdash; now cancelled &mdash; was a specific contingency to provide options that  might enable agreement on a legislative framework for transfer 2010 and beyond  &mdash; the challenge presented to us all by the St Andrews Agreement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I twice brought forward proposals to the Executive for just  such a legislative framework. Those proposals reflected my party&rsquo;s opposition  to academic selection, but also acknowledged the views of educationalists with  whom they were developed, and the views of pro-selective colleagues in  Government. Why else would I propose three more years of academic selection,  even on a declining basis? Those proposals were not even discussed. That is why  I abandoned them, that is why I decommissioned the CCEA test, and that is why I  decided to proceed with the guidelines.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The absence of a test and regulations is a result of the  refusal to engage politically &mdash; and the blocking of any discussion of my proposals  at Executive level &mdash; by the DUP. Twice I brought proposals to the Executive.  That failure to engage caused uncertainty for parents, teachers and children,  and was the most pressing reason for any decision to move forward on guidance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I reiterate that in the absence of political agreement there  will be no state-sponsored test: I will not reinstate the status quo. I have  set out the criteria that will be used to transfer children to post-primary  education from 2010. The Department&rsquo;s transfer 2010 guidance provides  admissions criteria that are already widely used and which promise clarity, and  &mdash; for the first time ever &mdash; fairness.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Any entrance test that operates outside that guidance is in  a legal minefield, as some grammar schools proposing such an approach are  finding out. If they continue, they will generate a damaging confusion for  parents and pupils. Therefore, I again urge them to consider carefully the  consequences of standing outside the system and of breaking away.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The transfer 2010 guidance has been issued for public  consultation, and I have written to parents of primary-6 pupils to explain the  content. The guidance is not preferable to regulation; however, if it is  followed, it will deliver an effective and fair system of post-primary  transfer. It will also deliver a system of post-primary transfer that will help  to answer the wider and desperately urgent reform agenda of embracing demo&shy;graphic  decline and schools sustainability, the delivery of the entitlement framework  and underachievement. If departmental policy and the guidance are followed, we  will have, for the first time, a system of transfer based on social justice,  equality and excellence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than continue to knock on doors that have already  been shut in our faces, rather than revisit ideas of proposals blocked, then  blocked again, I call on those genuine people who support change to grasp this  opportunity to end once and for all the practice of forcing 10-year-old  children to sit tests in order that some can access the education to which all  should be entitled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The train has left the station. Transfer 2010 is  departmental policy, and I look forward to working with every Member to build  an education system of excellent quality for all children.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  The debate addresses an issue of fundamental importance to society. If we were  living in a normal society with a normal Government, the failure to bring  forward a regulated method for the transfer of children from the primary to the  secondary sector of education would, undoubtedly, cause the fall of that  Government. That is the challenge facing the Minister, and she has not answered  it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not deny that the Minister&rsquo;s task has not been easy,  given that the unionist parties, who fundamentally oppose the removal of  academic selection, occupy precisely half of the seats in the Assembly.  However, many people in the community to whom I speak, including educators and  parents, are reflecting with great anxiety on how the Minister has confronted  this difficult task.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP amendment is a serious attempt to get the Assembly  out of an extremely difficult situation. It is a substantial and comprehensive  amendment that deserves the serious consideration of the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the test referred to in the amendment is the same  one as originally proposed by the Minister? At that time, the SDLP had  reservations, but she reassured us that the test could be used without  distorting the primary-school curriculum in any way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  certainly found the comments of the Minister, and of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s spokesperson  on education, strange, and I will probably refer to that later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us consider the party positions on the motion and the  amendment. The SDLP supports the motion, as amended; the Democratic Unionist  Party and the Ulster Unionist Party support the original motion; and Sinn F&eacute;in  supports neither. The Alliance Party supports the motion, having brought it  forward &mdash; its members seem to agree with much of the amendment, from what they  said, but essentially the original motion is the position that it wants to  sustain.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those party positions demonstrate the weakness of the  original motion. The parties that support the motion are those that are  absolutely opposed, in principle, to academic selection and those that are adamant  that it must continue. The motion is not a compromise, as one Member attempted  to say. It would not deliver a solution; it would not be an instruction to the  Minister to create a workable system.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Does the Member agree that Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s isolationist position today is  indicative of what it has done on education before? Martin McGuinness went down  the route of privatisation through PFI, and Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane is now going down  the route of privatisation through having a private test set for academic  selection.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  There is no doubt that we are walking into an unregulated system. However, I do  not find the position of the Member&rsquo;s party any more constructive than that of  the Minister&rsquo;s party.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fundamental failure of the Alliance Party&rsquo;s motion is  that it does not specify the proportion of pupils to be admitted using the  test. That is why parties with quite different principles were able to support  it. The motion gives no indication of a pathway or timetable towards creating a  system of regulated transfer without academic selection. All of those things  are provided in the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will comment on the remarks that were made by Members.  Dominic Bradley argued that the amendment was required in order to address the  uncertainty. He pointed out the weaknesses in the Alliance Party&rsquo;s motion and  he argued the potential for the entitlement framework and for area-based  planning to deliver a system that would have the confidence of parents. I  listened carefully to speeches from Democratic Unionist Party Members,  including Mervyn Storey, Nelson McCausland and Michelle McIlveen. I struggled  to discover what they might contribute to a consensus, but I did not find it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nelson McCausland made some reference to sitting down and  giving due consideration, but he gave no indication whatsoever as to what he  would bring to the table in such discussions. Without that offering from the  Democratic Unionist Party, we will not begin to break the current stalemate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  As the Member is a former teacher who taught in a grammar school in Ballymena &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  What advice does the Member have for parents whose children are facing entrance  tests for schools in Ballymena?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Time is up. I call Dr Farry to conclude the debate and make a  winding-up speech on the substantive motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  This has been an incredible debate on probably the most important issue on  which the people of Northern    Ireland are looking to the Assembly for  answers. In the Assembly, we have to deal with real-world choices. The choice  facing us is not about whether to abolish the 11-plus and move to a situation  in which there will be no academic selection. The real-world choice facing us  is whether to have a regulated system that includes academic selection for an  interim period, to provide some breathing space, or to have an unregulated  system that includes academic selection. That is the choice facing us, and we  must face up to that reality. We cannot afford to bury our heads in the sand  and deny what is happening in the wider world.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  With regard to the specific point that was made about social inequality &mdash; and I  agree with the Minister that there are issues concerning selection and social  equality &mdash; does the Member agree that it will be more socially divisive to have  an unregulated system in which people who are already most advantaged will be  best able to negotiate their way through that system?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Absolutely. The Minister made great play of quoting figures in relation to what  happens in different communities across Northern Ireland, and she laid down  the challenge to people in the Assembly. However, that challenge must be handed  back to the Minister &mdash; come back this time next year, after the test has been  introduced for a year, and quote the new figures. What we will find is that  social inequality in the system will be even worse, and things will not have  changed one bit for the better.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot have the situation whereby a Minister opts for  ideological purity and says that what she has done is Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s position,  while, at the same time, washing her hands of the consequences of that policy  for the rest of our society. As Mr O&rsquo;Loan said, we must have a regulated system  for Northern Ireland,  and to not have that is an act of rank irresponsibility.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party is perfectly clear about its policy and  preferred option. We have had that policy for many years throughout the debates  on the issue, and I thank Mitchel McLaughlin for setting it out so well.  However, we have to adjust our views to meet the realities that we face, and,  when facts change, it is only right that opinions change to meet those facts. I  dare say that, at different times, virtually every party in the Chamber has  shown some degree of responsibility in changing their policies to reflect the  new circumstances facing them. Indeed, if we go through the history of Sinn  F&eacute;in, it has changed policies on many occasions, and we would not be in the  situation of power sharing today had it not changed its position on a number of  issues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Not only is the Alliance Party looking to realities, but the person whom Ms Ruane  liked to quote &mdash; Stanley Poots, the headmaster of Dromara Primary School &mdash; was  not speaking on behalf of 30 schools in the Lisburn area and is actually having  pupils taught and prepared for tests in his own school, as well as in the other  schools that he purported to represent.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am grateful to the Member for his intervention. I may come to that point in a  moment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to be quite clear about what the Alliance Party is  trying to do today. First and foremost, we are trying to avoid a complete  disaster facing the education system in Northern Ireland due to an  unregulated system; and, in doing so, to provide a breathing space for a  consensual solution to emerge. We will keep our fingers crossed on that,  because we have not reached it thus far. However, that is our ultimate  responsibility, and we should not lose sight of that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">An unregulated system is a damning indictment of the  failure of the Assembly to deal with the most important issue facing our  society. There will be massive consequences for children and parents from an  unregulated system. There will be increased trauma from this system, even more  trauma than is currently faced through the 11-plus. Some children will face not  two tests, but, potentially, three tests under the Association for Quality  Education&rsquo;s (AQE) system. Indeed, the Catholic system may introduce its own  tests at some point in the near future. It is not beyond the realms of  possibility for some children to take tests under both systems. How many tests  are those children going to be facing? Therefore, children will be facing not  only more tests, but they will be doing them in a different environment from  their own primary school, adding further to the trauma.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Can the Member confirm &mdash; as was outlined earlier by Mr Lunn &mdash; that the motion  means that only the CCEA test should be used, and used in conjunction with  other, non-academic admissions criteria?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  can give a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to both of those points, and I will come to that in further  detail, too.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Primary schools are placed in a totally impossible  situation at the moment. They want to follow the guidance from the Minister and  be responsible, but they are also listening to the views and demands of  parents. In practice, many primary schools will be trying to facilitate  parents&rsquo; wishes on this issue. Some parents will opt for additional, external  coaching. When that happens, it will play into the hands of those who have the  money to pay for that coaching, further increasing the inequality in the  system. Is that fair?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are huge problems for the grammar schools that will  be conducting the tests. No doubt there will be an increased risk of legal  challenges occurring &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The Member has spoken quite eloquently about parents who want their children to  take three or four tests. What about those parents who do not want their  children to take tests? What about those parents who are, in some  circumstances, forced to have their children take tests because they believe  that those tests will lead to their children going to the best school, even  though that may not be the reality. What about those parents? Do those parents  not have rights?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention. Certainly, no one is forced to take a  test, and I have a lot of sympathy for what the Member is saying. That is why  the Alliance Party wants to work with Sinn F&eacute;in to achieve a consensual  solution that does not involve academic selection in the longer-term. However,  we must deal with the realities at the moment. Although I believe that grammar  schools would be foolish to go down the route of independent testing, the  reality is that they are determined to do so, and I cannot stop them from doing  so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Neither can the Minister.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Minister cannot either, nor can anyone else in the Chamber. Therefore, our  responsibility is to meet that reality in the best way possible, through a  regulated system, which is offered by the CCEA test.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept the abolition of the 11-plus. That is the  difference between the motion tabled by the Alliance Party today and that  tabled by the UUP last autumn. The Department itself has devised the CCEA test,  and that is a point worth stressing. Therefore, when the Minister talks about  matters of principle, the Minister has already conceded the point through  commissioning a CCEA test for development. She has referred to it as a  contingency option, but that point has already been conceded by the Minister.  The CCEA test will be based firmly on the existing curriculum. It does not  involve any skewing of teaching in primary schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to what Dominic Bradley said, I believe that  the CCEA test should be used as one option for schools with respect to  admission, alongside the best of the other options in the transfer 2010  guidance set out by the Minister. I do not dismiss that document one bit &#8213;  there is certainly value in it. However, we must use that guidance in line with  the realities of what is happening on the ground &#8213; in particular, the  socio-economic criteria within that are of some importance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must also bear in mind that what the Alliance Party is  suggesting is a time-limited breathing space. That time must be properly used  to try to find some consensus. Indeed, if people are talking about a new  working group of educationalists, that is something that is worthy of  consideration.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has talked about compromise proposals not  being accepted. The Alliance Party has always been prepared to engage on those  proposals, and I encourage the Minister to put those back on the table, if she  feels that that would be a better way forward. We are more than happy to talk  about them, and I am sure that other parties would do likewise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister says that the compromise proposals were taken  off the table because other parties would not engage. That means that the  children of Northern Ireland  are being punished because there is a lack of political agreement; it does not  strike me as being a lack of leadership.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP amendment is a matter of tactics. Our motion is,  deliberately, general in nature. It is based around the principle of putting  the CCEA test back on the table as an option, for use by receiving schools.  Tactically, we are trying to build as much consensus in the Chamber as we can,  rather than being specific.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  will not give way. I am sorry, but I am running out of time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The consensus that the Alliance Party is trying to achieve  is one that is supported across society in Northern Ireland. Our consensus is  more widespread, and I do not suggest that there is consensus around the  proposals outlined by the Minister. The Catholic Church and the Protestant  churches will reflect that later this week.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is our last chance to take a step back from the brink.  I urge the Assembly to use this chance wisely.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, <span style="font-style:normal; ">That the  amendment be made</span>, put and negatived.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes that schools may choose to use an  examination as part of their entry criteria under the Minister of Education&rsquo;s  2010 guidelines; calls on the Minister of Education to re-commission the CCEA  test, she abandoned on 2 February 2009, that schools may then use for a maximum  of two years; and calls on the Executive to agree new, legally binding  guidelines for post primary transfer for use from 2011.</p>

    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="7"></a>Adjournment</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Portadown   College Newbuild</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the proposer of the topic will have 15  minutes in which to speak. All other Members who wish to speak will have  approximately eight minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>: Portadown College is one of the jewels in the  crown of the Craigavon-based Dickson plan for education. It has an outstanding  academic track record and has been a great influence for good across the  generations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I visited the school no later than Thursday of last week  and was, once again, greatly impressed by the staff&rsquo;s commitment to delivering excellence  for young people in their care.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Portadown   College has been awaiting  a new building for too long. In the past few days, I received from the Minister  a response to a question for oral answer that was not selected for answer in  Question Time. She said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Department has completed its assessment of a  revised economic appraisal for Portadown   College which was  submitted by the Southern Education and Library Board. The Board has agreed to  undertake further work on the option to complete a replacement school on the  playing fields on the lower part of the existing school site.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That determination to press ahead with building on the  playing fields is causing major concern at the college. The board of governors  is of the opinion that the building of a new school on the playing fields is an  unsatisfactory way to move forward. There are six objections to that intention.  The school would disappear from view and be blocked by the natural amphitheatre  that would be created by building the new college in a hollow.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the school would lose its playing fields for  an extended period. The school holds a Sportsmark award, and it competes in the  highest level of regional competitions in a variety of sports.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It has one of the largest A-level and GCSE physical education  centres in Northern Ireland.  When new playing fields are constructed, they are not immediately ready for  use. That will extend the time during which those resources are unavailable,  and that will have a detrimental effect on the students.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Locating new pitches on the elevated part of the site would  be problematic. The proximity to neighbouring houses and the main Killycomain Road  would create a child-protection issue, as those pitches would be very exposed.  Another problem is that health and safety issues and good-relations issues  could be created by such things as rugby balls being kicked into gardens,  breakages of windows, or rugby balls being kicked onto the Killycomain Road. The current location of  the playing pitches is ideal and means that those issues are not a cause for  concern.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Portadown   College is a landmark  school in the town. It has a proud history of academic and extra-curricular  success. It has occupied its current position for approximately 60 years and  is, consequently, a recognised landmark fronting onto the Killycomain Road. Changing the location  of the school to the lower part of the site would raise significant objections  from the local community. It is believed that, in particular, residents of the Gilford Road would  object to that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The current plan does not offer any solution to ongoing  traffic problems on the Killycomain    Road. Locating the new school on the footprint of  the current buildings and demolishing the preparatory department would  facilitate a satisfactory solution to that problem.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As with any school, traffic will be a problem at certain  times of the day. However, the ability to take buses off the main road and into  the school site through the proposed construction of a turning circle would be  helpful and would reduce congestion. That would be made much easier if the new  building were sited on the current footprint.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the new school were located on the current playing  pitches, the access arrangements for cars parking on the school site would also  be of grave concern. The front of the school on the Killycomain Road would, essentially,  become a large car park, and security issues would arise. A school building on  the Killycomain Road  frontage would be a much better solution, as that would allow for parking at  the rear of the building, which would be more secure and less visible from the  main road.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The current proposal to build on the playing fields appears  to be based on the economic appraisal that was carried out in 2002-03, in which  only two options were considered. Those two options were a refurbishment of the  current school and a rebuild of the school. Since that time, the preparatory  department has closed. The result is that the locating of a new school on the  current footprint of the elevated part of the site has become a feasible  option, as much space has been cleared as a result of that closure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">According to current Southern Education and Library Board  (SELB) estimates, there is no significant cost differential between the two  options. The leadership of Portadown   College is satisfied that  a phased construction and demolition of the buildings on the current footprint  is manageable. Noise and poor air quality are not currently problems and are  not a reason to relocate the buildings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to instruct officials from her  Department to visit Portadown   College so that they can  see for themselves the case for locating the new building on the current  footprint. It is an outstanding college that offers an outstanding education to  those who attend it &mdash; and provided such an education to those who attended it  in the past. A new building would be very welcome. I hope that the Minister  will agree that, since it will be a building that will serve Portadown College  for many decades to come, it is essential that it be got right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those points were made by those who are on the front line  of education &mdash; the very educationalists to whom the Minister wants us all to  listen. I ask her to listen to what they are saying on this occasion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome this debate on Portadown College as it provides an opportunity to  discuss the broader issue of post-primary provision in the controlled sector in  the Craigavon area. I was recently in Portadown College  with the Education Committee, where we held a very successful meeting. We were  very well treated and welcomed by pupils and staff; it was an enjoyable  experience. Even from the lecture theatre in which the meeting took place, it  was clear that the school needs to be replaced. It is severely run down. The  fabric and interior of the building are, without doubt, in need of replacement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I have a broader concern about the Southern  Education and Library Board&rsquo;s provision of post-primary education in the  Craigavon area. There are two proposals from the SELB: one is to replace Portadown College;  the other is to replace Lurgan   College. Both of those  are fine grammar schools in their own right, and both provide education under  the terms of the Dickson plan.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In a recent meeting with the SELB, I was deeply concerned  that it did not have an overall plan for the provision for post-primary  education in the controlled sector. The plans to replace Portadown  College are justified, but when I  study the plans to replace Lurgan College, I ask why Lurgan  College will be replaced while the  Lurgan campus of Craigavon   Senior High School is in  its current condition. It is not adequate for the provision of education to the  pupils who attend it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I posed that question to the SELB, it could not tell  me why it has brought forward two proposals to replace two schools in the  absence of an overall plan to replace the Lurgan campus of Craigavon Senior High School,  which is attached to the old buildings of the Lurgan Technical   College. Its space is  restricted, it has no playing or sports facilities, and &mdash; even in its interior  &mdash; it does not provide adequate space or provision for the children who attend  it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note that Mr Simpson referred more to where the Portadown College newbuild should be placed,  although I am not aware of the technical details. However, there is a  requirement for a wider debate about controlled provision in the Craigavon area  because the current plans of the SELB are inadequate. To go ahead with two  newbuilds at two colleges and leave out the Lurgan campus of Craigavon Senior High    School is an inequitable provision of education.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Some time ago, I became concerned when it was announced that there would be a  10-month delay in the newbuilds for Portadown  College and Lurgan College.  I wrote to the Minister of Education to enquire about those delays. At the  time, I was concerned that many capital-spend projects across the Northern  Ireland Departments were being kicked into the next financial year in a  concerted effort to cover up the growing black hole in the Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At first, I suspected that Portadown  College and the Lurgan College  newbuilds could be victims of such a move. In response, I received a  categorical assurance from the Minister of Education that that was not the  case. I put that response on record in the House today because it is important  that the House record the facts. I say that because, since last November, there  has been mounting evidence that the budgetary black hole has grown to alarming  proportions, despite repeated denials by the Finance Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is conservatively estimated that there is a deficit of  at least &pound;1 billion. Only last week, the Finance Minister wrote to the Finance  Committee and suggested a rewriting of the priorities in the Programme for  Government, for which my colleague David McNarry has been calling since last  October.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That means that the budgetary pressure to delay Government  capital-build projects must logically be a factor in Government thinking and  possibly even in planning. It is for that reason that I want the Minister to  reassure me that delays in the Portadown College newbuild project are in no  respect due to pressure from the Minister of Finance and Personnel to save money  and to kick capital-build projects into next year.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In her reply to me last October, the Education Minister  said that the amended Lurgan College newbuild, which incorporates the historic  old building, had now passed the economic appraisal stage at the Department of  Education and has been sent to the Department of Finance and Personnel for  final approval. That was good news for Lurgan College,  Lurgan town and the surrounding villages.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, she also told me that the amended Portadown College newbuild was still under  consideration in the Department of Education&rsquo;s economic appraisal stage. She  told me that that was because it would involve the expenditure of additional  money and that it would have to pass that stage before it could be processed.  The Minister told me that that additional expenditure would have to be  justified under both the economic-appraisal guidance directions and &lsquo;The  Northern Ireland Practical Guide to the Green Book&rsquo; before it could progress to  the next stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In her letter, the Minister added that the SELB resubmitted  the economic appraisal for the Portadown   College newbuild for the  third time on 24 November 2008 and that it is currently being appraised by the  Department&rsquo;s advisers. The Minister told me that the Portadown College  scheme needed to be able to prove that it represented value for money, given  that there was in increase in the capital expenditure involved. That was some  four months ago, so I will listen with interest to the Minister&rsquo;s comments  today to find out what stage the process has now reached.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That situation raised another issue. Why could the  relationships between the SELB and the Department of Education not be adequate  enough to ensure that those delays were avoided? Did the SELB have to rewrite  its building specifications because it failed to provide adequate building  specifications to the Department in the first place? Alternatively, did the  Department fail to respond quickly enough to the SELB? I would like the  Minister to answer those questions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Whatever the cause, it is my constituents and their  children who have suffered as a result of those delays, and I object to that  situation in the strongest possible terms. I hope that the Minister will sort  the problem out quickly so that both Lurgan  College and Portadown College  get the badly needed newbuilds that they so deserve.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to speak in this Adjournment debate on the Portadown College  newbuild, although I note that some Members have used this opportunity to  expand the topic of the debate to include newbuilds in the Upper   Bann constituency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I had the privilege of working with Portadown College  in my previous job in the Health Service. The college carries out extensive  outreach work across the community and is well respected as a centre of  education excellence in the constituency. I, therefore, lend it my support.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past two years, I have written to the Minister to  try to tie down a time frame and a date for work to commence. I agree with Mr  Gardiner; we need to find out where the gridlock occurred. Did it happen at the  education board or at departmental level? Given that answers vary from time to  time, we need a direct answer to that question.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It would also be pertinent if the Minister could tell us  what impact the economic downturn is having on the school-building programme.  Yesterday, I specifically asked the Finance Minister about projects to rebuild  schools, and, unsurprisingly, he said that that was a matter for the Minister  of Education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister offer some reassurance about the delays  that exist across Upper Bann and, particularly, the delays with the newbuild at  Portadown College? Will the money for that  newbuild be there in the next financial year? Many people in the construction  industry, never mind children and parents, are depending on it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I spoke to Mrs O&rsquo;Hare, the principal of Portadown College,  some months ago. She expressed concerns that, coming into the GCSE and A-level  exam period, there was not enough accommodation for all the exams to take place  on site; that is a matter of grave concern to us all. Young people are under  enough pressure and stress without their school accommodation being unfit for  purpose.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I concur with those people who are trying to tie down a  definitive date on which the work will start. I support Mr Simpson&rsquo;s comments  about the school&rsquo;s excellence, outreach work and location. Given the school&rsquo;s  proximity to the playing fields at Bachelors Walk, I urge those involved to  consider working alongside Craigavon Borough Council on shared facilities; that  is partly the way to go.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note Mr O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s comments about Craigavon and wider  planning for the future, but surely the sustainable schools policy is something  on which the Minister and the Department should be taking a lead and giving  some direction. I am sure that the Minister is aware that the  Catholic-maintained sector in Upper Bann is already at an advanced stage of  looking at collegiate-type models with the amalgamation of junior high schools  and the senior high schools of St Mary&rsquo;s and St Paul&rsquo;s, and Our Lady&rsquo;s Grammar  School. I would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s view on that because,  surely, schools need direction when they are planning.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister comment on the viability of Portadown College? I understand that its feeder  schools are in the Newry and Armagh constituency as well as in Upper Bann and that there is always a fight for places. I  support the Minister&rsquo;s view that we should provide educational access for all  children, regardless of their social and economic background. We should provide  all our young people with an excellent education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">St Teresa&rsquo;s Primary School in the Lurgan area has been on  the agenda for a work plan for considerable time, and the Department and the  SELB are batting the ball around in respect of business cases and where the  fault line lies. I would be pleased if the Minister would outline whether the  money is there and when that work will start.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I congratulate my friend and Upper Bann  colleague, David Simpson, for securing the Adjournment debate on such an  important issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My three children and I have benefited from an education  under the Dickson plan, and I have been a consistent advocate of the plan.  Along with other local schools, Portadown   College has helped to  deliver an excellent academic experience for generations of young people. The  Minister may have concerns with some aspects of the Dickson plan, but it enjoys  the approval and support of the overwhelming majority of people in the area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I add my voice to the points raised by David Simpson in his  opening speech on the proposed newbuild for Portadown College.  The case for a newbuild on the existing footprint of the school speaks for  itself. I welcome the agreement of the Minister and the Department that a new  school ought to be built. The real issue is: which is the better option? Any  fair-minded observer would conclude that the case for building on the existing  footprint has been made conclusively.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The benefits of that option are as follows: it is cost  effective, in that any difference in cost between the options is minimal; it  preserves the college&rsquo;s location as a prominent feature of the area; it does  more to minimise traffic-flow problems; it preserves the sporting side of the  college in a much more continuous way, and, crucially, it also preserves the  playing fields as an integral and unified part of the college; it does more to  aid relationships with people who live close to the school; and it avoids the  potential personal-security issues that may arise from the current proposal.  These are telling arguments, and the Minister should give them serious  consideration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On another point, the Southern Education and Library Board  and the board of governors of Portadown   College have serious  health and safety concerns over window frames that do not hold glass securely.  It is imperative that the issue of location is resolved; otherwise expenditure  in the region of &pound;500,000 will be required to address that urgent issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I trust that the Minister will listen to the concerns that  have been raised today, and, as a result, will act swiftly to progress the  newbuild on the current footprint &mdash; and also the much needed newbuild for Lurgan College.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful for the opportunity to join with other Members, especially those  from the Upper Bann constituency, to speak about the need for Portadown College  to have a newbuild as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The impact and outreach of Portadown  College in providing education extends  beyond the constituency of Upper Bann. Many of  the primary schools that supply pupils to Portadown  College are situated in my  constituency of Newry and Armagh.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to the principal, her predecessors and all  the staff at Portadown   College for the  high-quality education that they have provided over many years. In providing  such education, sporting achievement and the full remit of the educational  curriculum, Portadown   College has an excellent  record.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that the school estate at Portadown College  is in dire need of refurbishment and replacement. It has taken its place in the  queue for many years. The board of governors, teachers, staff, parents and  pupils have been very patient as they wait in expectation for work to begin. It  is time for a clear statement of intent to be made to the House by the  Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not wish to make a political point, but the Minister  and her predecessor and party colleague Martin McGuinness did not place much  emphasis in supporting newbuild projects for grammar schools. The record of the  Department of Education under their leadership confirms that. I want an  assurance from the Minister that she will not allow her opposition to grammar  schools &mdash; or her party&rsquo;s opposition to grammar education &mdash; to impact in any way  on the logical case that has been put forward for provision of a newbuild for  Portadown College. We have also heard the case for Lurgan College.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am very happy to support an urgent rebuild for Portadown College, so that it can continue its  outstanding record of providing high-quality education.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: I thank Mr Simpson for bringing forward this debate  about the proposed major capital scheme for a newbuild at Portadown College.  It affords me an opportunity to address Members&rsquo; concerns about the progress of  the project. I listened carefully to all who have spoken.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I reject the comments that were made by Danny Kennedy about  my colleague Martin McGuinness, which were in poor taste and do not reflect  reality. Mr Kennedy said that I am opposed to grammar school education, but  nothing could be further from the truth. If Members read what I say carefully,  they will find that I am asking that, for the first time ever, grammar schools  make their excellent education available to all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What I am opposed to is the inequality in the system, not  to any particular part of the system. I ask that the Member not make inaccurate  comments.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In March 2006, a scheme was announced for Portadown College.  However, in April 2007, the Southern Education and Library Board advised the  Department that it wished to review the agreed economic appraisal to take  account of the potential additional provision to be provided by the Sports  Council and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mar is eol do Chomhalta&iacute;, t&aacute; s&eacute; r&iacute;th&aacute;bhachtach go mbaintear  &uacute;s&aacute;id mhaith as na hacmhainn&iacute; at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il don Roinn Oideachais agus go dtugtar  cuntas iontu. T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach mar sin go mb&iacute;onn gach breithmheas  eacnama&iacute;ochta, lena n-&aacute;ir&iacute;tear an ceann do Chol&aacute;iste Phort an D&uacute;n&aacute;in, san &aacute;ireamh.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members know, it is vital that the resources available  to the Department of Education be put to good use and accounted for. It is  therefore essential that all economic appraisals, including revised economic  appraisals such as the one for Portadown   College, be in line with  the requirements of the &lsquo;Practical Guide to the Green Book&rsquo;, produced by the  Department of Finance and Personnel. Equally, it is important that Departments  work together, and all Members have told me that they want to see that happen.  Members want DCAL and the Department of Education to work together, and I have  pledged my support to that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To date, three revisions of the economic appraisal have  been considered by the Department&rsquo;s professional advisors. The need for further  work was explained at a meeting between the Department and the SELB. Once the  Department has agreed a revised economic appraisal, we will work with the  Department of Finance and Personnel before putting the scheme forward to  proceed with planning. I know that Members are interested in the area-based  planning process. Full area planning will involve four related key components:  area plans; asset management information; strategic investment plans; and  project level appraisal, or economic appraisals and business cases.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed education and skills authority will have  operational responsibility for area-based planning and will work closely with  educational interests, which will have an important role in the process. The  Department will have a policy guidance and approval role. Full implementation  of the approach will be taken forward when the ESA is fully up and running. I  know that Members are concerned about the time that has elapsed since the  scheme was announced. However, I emphasise the importance of ensuring that the  principles of appraisal have been applied correctly and that the decision on  how best to provide suitable accom&shy;modation for current and future pupils  attending Portadown   College is robust and  presents value for money. The Southern Education and Library Board has advised  that the period of construction for the scheme is about three years. It is  estimated that the replacement school will be completed by 2012-13 at a current  market value of &pound;15 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On-site work is progressing on 27 major capital schemes,  and a further 74 major schemes are at various stages of planning; those schemes  are being taken forward in conjunction with the relevant authorities. Approval  for construction work to begin on those projects, and indeed on all capital  projects, will be subject to the necessary planning and building processes  being satisfactorily completed and the availability of resources in any  particular year. Approval will be subject to, and take account of, departmental  policies, including area-based planning and the sustainable schools policy.  There is no question of our not having the resources for the capital projects  that we have outlined. As I said, those projects will be subject to, and take  account of, departmental policies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that a new school for Portadown College  is central to the SELB&rsquo;s plans for Portadown and the wider Craigavon area. The  aim is that Portadown College will work in partnership with the local  further education college, the Portadown campus of Craigavon Senior High    School. That will ensure that the full range of  the entitlement framework can be delivered to young people in Portadown.  Members know that I believe very strongly in collaborative working and in  focusing on outcomes for pupils in an area rather than on the needs of  individual institutions or buildings. That is the way forward for education.  Many more schools are now engaged in innovative and creative approaches to  collaborative working through the area learning communities, which represents a  significant change. I sincerely hope that the proposed new facilities will  represent a real resource for pupils, not just in Portadown College  but in the Portadown area and beyond.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department was informed by SELB officers in December  2008 that Portadown   College had withdrawn  from the Craigavon area learning community due to &ldquo;other significant priorities  and planning challenges&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the school will have another look at that, because  it is important that the 21 learning communities across the North function  well. They are an important part of our education &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Is that blackmail?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Of course it is not blackmail. In light of your earlier  comments, please do not add insult to injury. It is part of the Department of  Education&rsquo;s policy, and it is important that all the learning communities are  given that role. We have to put children first, and I encourage all schools to  play an active role in their learning communities.</p>
