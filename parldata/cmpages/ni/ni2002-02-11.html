              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I would like
              to ask you to explain to the House why, in the past, the House
              stood in silence for people and then commented on their passing
              — we had the deaths of the First Minister of Scotland, a
              journalist and a postal worker — and yet on the death of the
              only sister of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom, it did
              not stand in silence to observe her passing? Can you assure me
              that it was not because of threats from certain Members of the
              House that, if that took place, they would see to it that they
              would be seated and would not take part in such a thing? Can you
              also explain to us why the Union flag is not flying at half mast
              on the Building today?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First of all, there was of course the death of
              one individual that was commemorated here, to which I think the
              Member did not refer. That is the death of a Member, Mr Tom
              Benson. As I recall, although I stand open to correction as ever,
              the deaths to which the Member referred were not all dealt with in
              the same way. In the case of Mr Benson and the First Minister of
              Scotland, I believe that there was a motion that was spoken to. In
              the other cases, I believe, there was a short period of silence.
              It does not seem appropriate that the passing of Her Royal
              Highness The Princess Margaret should be commemorated in exactly
              the same way, but rather in a different way. That has been done by
              the suspension of the House.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second question that the Member asked was
              whether there was any threat, and I am sure that he means was it
              conveyed to me in any way — not just by word of mouth or in
              writing — and the answer is that there was not. No one spoke to
              me or raised the question with me. I try to use my best judgement
              to be the servant of the House, but no one raised any such
              questions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third question that the Member raised was
              on the flying of the flag. I enquired on Saturday morning as to
              whether there were any flag orders from the palace. I was advised
              that that was not the case. Subsequently, I made enquiries with
              the Parliaments in Westminster and Edinburgh, the Assembly in
              Wales and the Parliament in Dublin, none of which had made any
              decisions, but all were considering the matter this morning. I
              gave instruction that, if there was an order, the flag should fly
              at half mast, but, if there was not, that understanding from the
              palace should also be accepted.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is my understanding that it is intended that
              the flag will fly at half mast throughout the country on the day
              of the funeral, which I understand to be Friday 15 February at St
              George’s Chapel. That is why the flag is not flying at half mast
              today. However, I expect there to be an order in respect of Friday
              15 February, when the flag will fly at half mast.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a further point of order, Mr Speaker.
              Hansard reports that the House observed two minutes’ silence
              when the First Minister of Scotland died.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that a motion was tabled on that
              occasion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is correct.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the point I am making. The matter has
              been given some consideration. All deaths are in some way the
              same; that is one of the great levellers. However, there is
              another sense in which not all deaths have precisely the same
              meaning, and so they are handled differently. The Member will also
              notice, since I think he has Hansard to hand — and this may not
              be so well known to members of the public — that in certain
              circumstances a black border surrounds the relevant pages and,
              earlier this morning, I gave instructions that that should be done
              today.</p>

              </b>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I introduce two important resolutions of the
              budgetary cycle. The first resolution seeks the approval of the
              Assembly to the issue of a further sum of £198 million from the
              Consolidated Fund and the use of additional resources amounting to
              £574 million for the 2001-02 financial year, as detailed in the
              spring Supplementary Estimates booklet.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second resolution seeks the Assembly’s
              approval on the issue of a cash sum of £3,936 million on account
              for the 2002-03 financial year. It also seeks the Assembly’s
              authority for the use of resources amounting to £4,486 million on
              account in the 2002-03 financial year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before moving to the detail of those
              resolutions, I wish to acknowledge the confirmation by the
              Committee for Finance and Personnel that there has been adequate
              consultation with it on the public expenditure proposals reflected
              in those resolutions. I am aware of the Committee’s keen and
              proper interest in finance issues, and I look forward to working
              with the Committee in the coming months. I hope to build on the
              constructive and positive relationship established by my
              predecessor, Mark Durkan, and to see what more we can do to
              improve the consultative process and enhance the scrutiny role of
              the Assembly and its Committees.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As an Assembly, one of our fundamental
              responsibilities is to authorise expenditure and to hold
              Departments to account for how it is used. Resolutions such as
              those that I am introducing today are the basis on which the
              legislature, in the form of the Assembly, authorises the spending
              of the Departments, the Assembly, the Northern Ireland Audit
              Office and other bodies for the exercise of their various
              functions. That is one of the main means we have of ensuring that
              we deliver on our agreed plans and, in due course, deliver the
              Executive’s Programme for Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The scope of the debate covers expenditure in
              2001-02 and 2002-03. The first of the two resolutions is the means
              by which Supplementary Estimates can be examined by the Assembly.
              As was the case with the Main Estimates for 2001-02, and as is now
              the normal practice, those Supplementary Estimates are also
              presented on a resource basis. The Supplementary Estimates are the
              main means of implementing and confirming the decisions by the
              Executive on the allocation of resources brought forward from
              2000-01 under the end-year flexibility arrangements, and on the
              reallocation of resources through the in-year monitoring rounds in
              June, September and December. It also includes decisions that have
              been made in relation to the second tranche of the Executive
              programme funds, which my predecessor, Mark Durkan, announced on 3<sup>
              December. Therefore, the Supplementary</sup> Estimates represent
              the implementation of financial decisions that we have taken since
              the Assembly agreed the opening position when it approved the Main
              Estimates last June.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to emphasise a fundamentally important
              aspect of the first resolution: we are not dealing with new
              proposals; we are merely giving effect to decisions that have
              already been made and brought to the attention of the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second resolution is the usual means by
              which, at this point in the financial cycle, Departments’
              ongoing financial commitments are authorised during the period
              between the beginning of the 2002-03 financial year and the
              presentation to the Assembly of the Main Estimates for that year,
              which will take place in June. In general, the cash and resource
              amounts required on account have been calculated as 45% of the
              2001-02 total voted provision.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As its name suggests, the Vote on Account is
              not intended to seek the Assembly’s final approval of the
              allocations for 2002-03, since less than half of the total
              proposed Budget is being sought in this Budget Bill. It seeks
              sufficient resources and cash to allow services to proceed until
              the detailed work on the Main Estimates has been completed in the
              late spring. At that stage there will be a full opportunity to
              deal with the details of the spending plans for 2002-03. Last year
              there was prior discussion between my Department and the Committee
              for Finance and Personnel on the Main Estimates, and I propose to
              continue that practice. Thus, today I propose to focus on the
              issues relating to 2001-02, as this is the last major opportunity
              for discussion on that period before the end of the financial
              year.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is only the second time that Supplementary
              Estimates have been presented to the Assembly, and it might be
              helpful if I remind Members of some important aspects of the
              Estimates that differ from the Budget and the monitoring rounds.
              First, the Estimates include all aspects of departmental
              expenditure that are subject to the authorisation of resources and
              associated cash appropriation. This means that they include
              annually managed expenditure as well as that which falls within
              the departmental expenditure limit. Because we receive automatic
              adjustment of estimated requirements for annually managed
              expenditure from the Treasury — and have to return any resources
              that we do not need to the Treasury — these items are not
              included in the scope of the public expenditure monitoring rounds,
              which the Executive conduct and which are regularly announced to
              the Assembly. The main items in this category are social security
              benefits — some of which are subject to annual appropriation or
              authorisation — and others that are charged under legislation to
              the National Insurance fund, and, hence, do not feature in the
              voting process. Annually managed expenditure also contains the
              major non-cash elements of departmental budgets arising from the
              transition to resource-based budgeting — principally
              depreciation and the cost of capital charges. Lastly, expenditure
              under the common agricultural policy also falls into this category
              because it is fully funded by the European agricultural guarantee
              and guidance fund.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As well as these annually managed expenditure
              items, there are some aspects of expenditure that were nominally
              attached to the departmental expenditure limit, but which are
              ring-fenced by the Treasury. <i>[Interruption].</p>
              </i><b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I fear that Members will have some
              difficulty following the complexity of this statement if they do
              not listen. They will also ensure that other Members do not hear
              the complexity of the statement.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, Mr Speaker, for your intervention.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we have no discretion in the use of these
              resources, they have not been included in our monitoring rounds.
              These include expenditure under the EU Peace programmes, and a
              special addition provided some years ago to cover the costs of the
              Moyle electricity interconnector. The Supplementary Estimates
              contain several reduced requirements under the EU Peace programmes
              that are needed to align with actual expenditure under the
              programmes. The funding will be made available again in future
              years and will not be lost to Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already mentioned that some expenditure
              on social security is handled outside the voting system. This is
              because there are standing authorisations, in the form of specific
              legislation, which allow money to be drawn from the Consolidated
              Fund, or another fund, to provide the particular service. A
              further example arises when a Department makes a loan under a
              statutory power. Often under the cash regime the issue of the loan
              will count towards the departmental expenditure limit, but in some
              cases this would not need to come through the Estimates and voting
              system because there is a standing authorisation for the making of
              loans outside the vote.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the important sources of room to
              manoeuvre are outside the appropriation system; in particular,
              receipts from house sales are outside the Department for Social
              Development votes. The total that determines what we can do is the
              departmental expenditure limit set by the Treasury. The house
              sales release some of that spending power, which makes it possible
              to afford an increase in the cash spending and hence helps us to
              afford the Supplementary Estimates.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also bear in mind the convention that
              Estimates are not reduced as the year progresses, even if it is
              clear that the Department concerned will not require the full
              extent of the Main Estimates cover. By their nature, the figures
              are estimates, and the sense of the resolution is that the
              Executive and the Departments are seeking authorisation for
              spending up to the figure quoted in the Estimates. I appreciate
              that it is difficult to fully take in all the parameters that
              surround the spending procedures, but, nonetheless, they are
              important for the record, and Members should have received the
              published statement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final complication that I need to mention
              is that there can be agreed transfers of resources between
              Departments, among Departments of the Executive and the Northern
              Ireland Office or between Departments here and Whitehall
              Departments. By convention, if responsibility for a function
              transfers, the departmental expenditure limit spending provision
              transfers with it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All these factors are important. They affect
              how the figures that are discussed and set out in the Budget
              planning documents and in the subsequent monitoring rounds are in
              the end reflected in the final amounts, which must be authorised
              for issue from the Consolidated Fund to cover the approved
              expenditure. This is undeniably complex but essential in order to
              meet the twin requirements that we keep expenditure within the
              overall Northern Ireland departmental expenditure limit and seek
              authorisation for no greater amount of expenditure than is set out
              in the Estimates.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The approval of the Main Estimates for 2001-02
              by the Assembly last June provided the detailed basis for the
              allocation and use of resources for the specific purposes
              described in the Estimates. Since then there have been in-year
              monitoring rounds in June, September and December, which resulted
              in decisions to make changes in these allocations, as well as a
              further announcement of funding from the Executive programme
              funds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The in-year monitoring exercises provide an
              important means — indeed, usually the only means — by which we
              can respond to new pressures by taking advantage of any easements
              that emerge. I know that there has been some disquiet among
              Members about the substantial sums that have become available
              during monitoring rounds, and I have indicated that the Executive
              have agreed that we should examine the financial monitoring
              systems to see if there is room to improve our forecasting.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me address at this point a fundamental
              issue regarding the monitoring process, particularly as there has
              been an attempt to misrepresent how such moneys could, and should,
              be used. When Departments underspend on their budgets, those
              moneys are surrendered to the centre, where they can be
              reallocated according to the Executive’s priorities. They are
              not available for reallocation by Ministers within Departments.
              That would be wrong, as by their nature monitoring moneys are
              short term, and it would be politically dishonest to suggest that
              such funds could be used to address long-term policy issues. Some
              Members have suggested that underspent money in the Department for
              Employment and Learning, for example, could have been redirected
              towards student support.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Allegations of wastage have been made against
              that Department. Not only are such allegations factually incorrect
              in the amounts of money referred to with regard to underspends,
              but in making these misrepresentations a disservice is being
              rendered to the genuine cause of students’ welfare, to which the
              House has already directed considerable attention and resources.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addressing these issues, particularly
              monitoring rounds, we must bear in mind the length of the
              financial planning cycle. We must also encourage Departments to
              continue to identify easements as early in the financial year as
              possible so that they can ensure that they are deployed to the
              best possible effect. A good example of this is the final
              monitoring round of the financial year, which is held in February.
              Practical opportunities to spend at that time are limited.
              Furthermore, decisions are made on the monitoring round after the
              Supplementary Estimates have been agreed. Therefore, there is
              limited scope to deploy funds. It is problematic if Departments
              make large surrenders at that stage, as the opportunities to allow
              other Departments to take advantage of the funding are limited.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The outcomes of the monitoring rounds and the
              decisions on the Executive programme funds have been accompanied
              by detailed statements to the Assembly at each stage. Although it
              is not possible to have prior consultations with the Committee for
              Finance and Personnel before announcing the Executive’s
              decisions on those monitoring rounds, Mark Durkan and I have been
              available to explain the position, and there has been scope since
              each monitoring round for any scrutiny that may have been
              required. In this context, I want to repeat Mark Durkan’s advice
              that Committees do not need a starting gun from the Department of
              Finance and Personnel to ask their Departments about emerging
              spending pressures, or to scrutinise performance at any time
              throughout the year. As I said, they have the liberty and the
              capacity to do so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The total amount of the Supplementary Estimates
              is £574 million in resource terms and an associated cash
              requirement of £198 million for the year ending 31 March 2002.
              The detailed allocations contained in the booklets have been
              determined by Departments after careful consideration and approval
              by the Department of Finance and Personnel. Ministers will be
              better placed than I to explain and justify some of the detail,
              but, in so far as I can do so today, I shall try to deal with any
              of the matters raised by Members. If I cannot, I shall refer the
              matter to the relevant Minister for more detailed consideration.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To gain a picture of how the figures of £574
              million and £198 million in resources and cash respectively are
              made up, one must go back to the decisions taken after the
              monitoring rounds. First, there is on this occasion a significant
              difference between the resource and cash requirements, as the
              figures show. That is largely due to an increase of £300 million
              of resources — but not cash — sought by the Department for
              Regional Development to reflect a reassessment of the value of the
              road network.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the reasons that I have given, the amounts
              reallocated do not correspond exactly to the net surplus after
              monitoring, since several technical adjustments are also made at
              those stages.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a href="#top">TOP</a></p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the reasons that I gave, the amounts
              reallocated do not correspond exactly to the net surplus after
              monitoring, because technical adjustments are made at those
              stages. However, during the monitoring rounds the Departments
              declared some £146·2 million as easements, which were weighed
              against bids for additional resources totalling £415·5 million.
              Inevitably, there is some double counting in the figures for bids,
              because unsuccessful bids in one round are likely to be repeated
              later. A further £30 million for Departments was also announced
              through the Executive programme funds. Those figures help to
              illustrate the process. I will say more about how individual
              allocations to individual Departments will be affected later.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As with the approval of the Main Estimates last
              June and the agreement of the Budget for 2002-03 in December,
              decisions about the allocation of resources have been influenced
              by equality requirements, as set out in the Northern Ireland Act
              1998 and policy precepts such as New TSN and the Programme for
              Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know from the interest that Members and
              Committees demonstrated, especially the Committee for Finance and
              Personnel, that the responsibility that we fulfil today is not
              assumed lightly. As an Executive and an Assembly, we have a duty
              to ensure the highest standards of propriety in respect of public
              finances. That is an aspect of the authorisation, management and
              control of expenditure by the Assembly, the Departments and the
              bodies that they fund. The efficient use of resources is no less
              important as we strive to deliver the highest- quality public
              services from the funds available.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are matters in which the Northern Ireland
              Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee have a particular
              interest. They can examine how public sector bodies perform in
              meeting their objectives and ensure that they do so with propriety
              and efficiency. As the Minister of Finance and Personnel, I
              acknowledge the important function that they perform and the
              interest, proposals and work of the Committee for Finance and
              Personnel.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not propose to discuss line by line the
              changes to the allocations for individual Departments, because the
              introduction to each departmental Estimate within the
              Supplementary Estimates booklet sets out in detail — some might
              say in too much detail — the main changes that are sought. I
              will, however, highlight some of the key changes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The total net additional resource requirement
              of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is £54·5
              million. In request for resources A, which provides for ongoing
              services and support measures, an additional £15·8 million net
              resource requirement is sought. Additions of £32 million are
              necessary. Those cover costs relating to animal disease, including
              foot-and-mouth disease, brucellosis, tuberculosis and BSE, as well
              as the funding required for the national element of the
              agrimonetary package. Those additions are offset by reductions
              totalling £16·2 million, including those resulting from a delay
              in the Northern Ireland scrapie plan as a result of foot-and-mouth
              disease, from the beef quality initiative, and the processing and
              marketing grants, which were affected by a delay in obtaining
              state aids approval. There are also reduced requirements for the
              funding of rural development grants, the European Union Peace
              programme, capital charges and depreciation costs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In request for resources B, which provides for
              the work of the Rivers Agency, the Forest Service and sea
              fisheries, an additional £38·7 million net resource requirement
              is sought. Additions of £40·8 million are necessary, of which
              £38·7 million is for capital charges and depreciation costs
              attributable to revaluation of the assets of the Rivers Agency.
              Other additions arise in respect of foot-and-mouth-disease costs
              and the Forest Service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These additions are offset by reductions
              totalling £2·1 million, which are mainly in respect of the
              European Union Peace programme. When the additional resource
              requirement is adjusted to a cash basis, and capital expenditure
              is taken into account, the Department is seeking additional cash
              of £17·6 million to fund expenditure on the Estimate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The total net additional resource requirement
              for the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure is £13·2
              million. The major additions are £10 million for the public
              library service to meet the one-off costs of the arrears arising
              from the job evaluation review, as well as ongoing costs, and an
              additional £1·6 million for the Museums and Galleries of
              Northern Ireland (MAGNI) to address deficits and
              health-and-safety-related maintenance work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The additions are offset by a reduction of £1
              million through rescheduling of expenditure in the European Union
              Peace programme, and a number of smaller technical adjustments
              totalling £0·6 million. When the additional resource requirement
              is adjusted to a cash basis, and capital expenditure is taken into
              account, the Department is seeking additional cash of £12·3
              million to fund expenditure on the Estimate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An increase of £13·6 million is sought by the
              Department of Education in request for resources A, which covers
              schools. That includes an increase of £16·4 million in capital
              provision, which is mainly for schools and includes provision of
              £2 million for disabled access. A sum of £10·2 million is being
              provided for teachers’ pay, £3 million for infrastructure
              provision for the Classroom 2000 project and £1·2 million for
              school fuel costs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those increases are offset principally by
              reduced requirements of £13 million on threshold payments to
              teachers, as, in accrual terms, certain threshold payments relate
              to the 2000-01 financial year, not the 2001-02 financial year.
              Other reduced requirements relate to the European Union Peace
              programme and the deferment of the introduction of the revised
              Northern Ireland curriculum from September 2003 to September 2004.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In request for resources B, which covers the
              Youth Service and community relations for young people, an
              increase of some £3·5 million is sought. This includes £1
              million in mainstream Youth Service provision, including £0·1
              million for support measures in north Belfast, as well as other
              additions totalling £3 million for capital programmes, European
              Union programmes and the Executive programme funds for the Youth
              Service. When the resource requirement is adjusted to a cash
              basis, and departmental capital expenditure is taken into account,
              the Department is seeking a cash increase of some £20·2 million
              to fund expenditure in the Estimate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The total net additional resource requirement
              for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment is £10·8
              million. In request for resources A, which provides for the
              Department’s economic and regeneration measures, an additional
              net £12·2 million is sought. Additions include £16·5 million
              being carried forward from 2000-01 under end-year flexibility
              arrangements for the Moyle interconnector, £7 million for
              payments under the European Union Peace I programme, and £2
              million to enable LEDU to meet an increase in demand for grants by
              the small business sector. Those additions have been offset by a
              reduced requirement of £13·6 million from the Industrial
              Development Board, arising from the economic downturn.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In request for resources B, which provides for
              equality, policy and regulatory measures, there is a net decrease
              of £1·4 million made up of a technical reallocation of £2·8
              million to request for resources A for depreciation and capital
              charges and a further reallocation from request for resources A to
              request for resources B to meet administration, legal and
              consultancy costs. When the additional resource requirement is
              adjusted to a cash basis, and capital expenditure is taken into
              account, the Department is seeking additional cash of £12·8
              million to fund expenditure on this Estimate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The total net additional resource requirement
              for the Office for the Regulation of Electricity and Gas is £0·3
              million. This includes additional provision to cover salary and
              associated costs on gas-related work and results in a cash
              requirement of £0·2 million to fund expenditure on this
              Estimate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Regional Development is
              seeking an increase of just over £306 million in the total net
              resource requirement. There is a reduction of under £5 million in
              the total provision to meet direct expenditure on the purchase of
              assets and investment in capital projects. The Department’s
              request for resources A covers roads, transport and strategic
              planning functions with related central administration. The
              increase of approximately £315 million is attributable mainly to
              an increase in non-cash costs such as depreciation and capital
              charges after a revaluation of the road network. Additional
              resources of just under £11 million are being made available for
              structural maintenance and essential bridge maintenance as well as
              to meet the increased costs of certain oil-based products. These
              additional costs are partly offset by an increase of £1 million
              in income, mainly from car-parking charges.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Provision for capital expenditure by the Roads
              Service is reduced by £1·7 million due to delays in the progress
              of some road schemes. An increase of £1·4 million is for the
              purchase of the new Strangford ferry and reflects a redistribution
              of resources in the Roads Service. On the transport side there are
              increases of £2·8 million for the public service obligation
              compensation payable to Northern Ireland Railways and £3 million
              for grants to the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company for
              rail and bus fare concessions. Request for resources A also
              includes an additional £5 million to fund capital expenditure by
              the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Department’s request for resources B,
              which relates to the provision of water and sewerage services,
              there is an overall reduction in the total net resource
              requirement. That largely reflects a reassessment of depreciation
              and the cost of capital charges and other non-cash costs. An
              increase of £2·5 million is sought to cover increased salary and
              wage costs as well as an increase of £3·3 million to meet
              additional costs incurred for sludge disposal and odour reduction
              measures. Those increases are partly offset by additional income
              of £1 million, mainly from metered water charges.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the capital side, the increase in provision
              of £1·4 million includes an additional £0·8 million for the
              purchase of information technology equipment, together with a
              redistribution of resources. When accruals to cash adjustments are
              made, the Department for Regional Development’s net cash
              requirement for the year is increased by £19 million to £528
              million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Employment and Learning is
              seeking an increase of £3·2 million in request for resources A
              covering higher and further education and student support. The
              increase is to provide disabled people with access to higher and
              further education institutions, to cover a higher than expected
              pay award for further education lecturers, additional grant for
              Lisburn College and additional private finance initiative (PFI)
              costs, and to take account of carry forward of unspent capital
              budget under the end-year flexibility scheme.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The total net additional resource requirement
              for the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is
              £94·9 million. In request for resources A, which mainly provides
              for ongoing departmental administration costs, an additional £1
              million net resource requirement is being sought. That includes
              funding for the Occupational Health Service, £0·2 million for
              additional staff, and cover for reduced income. It is offset by a
              reduction in the Health Estates Agency.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An additional £92·9 million net resource
              requirement is being sought in request for resources B, which
              provides for the health and personal social services programme.
              This includes £49·6 million, which is a non-cash adjustment with
              neutral impact on the overall spending power. Additional funds
              have been made available to the Health Service at each monitoring
              round during the current financial year and include £28 million
              towards hospital and community care pressures.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ten million pounds was made available for
              health and social services trust deficits. Decisions made by the
              Executive, coupled with careful financial management and
              monitoring, mean that positive steps have been taken to ensure
              that the financial management of the Health Service has been put
              onto a firmer footing and that expenditure will be managed within
              the resources available. Funding has also gone towards increasing
              access to new treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and to cardiac
              surgery, and towards measures to facilitate earlier discharge from
              hospital and to prevent avoidable admission.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other significant increases within this request
              for resources include £5 million for demand-led family health
              services, £2 million towards clinical negligence settlements, £3
              million for drug strategy projects and action to combat drugs, and
              £1·4 million for grants available under the EU Peace programme.
              The total increase in this area has been offset by £9 million
              additional receipts from Health Service contributions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Request for resources C contains an additional
              £1 million for the Fire Authority towards staff pension costs.
              When the resource requirement is adjusted to a cash basis, and
              capital expenditure is taken into account, the Department of
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety is seeking an additional
              £46 million to fund expenditure on this Estimate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Social Development is
              seeking increases in its three requests for resources. An increase
              of £14 million is being sought in request for resources A, which
              covers the Department’s social security and child support
              programmes. That is made up of additional non-contributory and
              income-related benefit expenditure of £9 million due to increased
              requirements for a range of benefits and payments. A further £1
              million is required for administration, and £4 million for
              certain non-cash items.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In request for resources B, which covers the
              Department’s housing programme, additional resources of £5
              million are being sought, mainly in the revenue grant to the
              Housing Executive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Additional resources of £14·5 million are
              being sought in request for resources C, which covers the
              Department’s urban regeneration and community development
              programme. Those include additional funding for Making Belfast
              Work and the Derry Regeneration Initiative’s programme
              expenditure, the EU programmes, the Executive programme funds and
              administration costs. When the resource requirement is adjusted to
              a cash basis, and capital expenditure is taken into account, the
              Department is seeking an additional £34 million cash to fund
              expenditure on the Estimate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now turn to the Department of Finance and
              Personnel, where an additional £24,000 is being sought in request
              for resources A to cover additional running costs in the central
              finance group.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An additional £6·1 million is required in
              request for resources B, which covers support for public sector
              business performance. That covers the net effect of the increased
              costs of running the Government estate and the census, the
              provision of research and statistical services, and the provision
              of purchasing services, which are funded by transfers by other
              Departments. The sum of £49,000 is required in request for
              resources C, arising from the implementation of the final phase of
              the Valuation and Lands Agency’s grade and structure review.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Finance and Personnel seeks
              an additional £19·3 million to meet higher than anticipated
              costs associated with the operation of the Civil Service
              superannuation scheme. I emphasise that those costs are borne in
              annually managed expenditure and, therefore, do not restrict the
              resources available for allocation by the Executive. The main
              reasons for the increase are the higher than anticipated
              transfer-out costs — where members leave the superannuation
              scheme — and the increasing numbers reaching normal retirement
              age.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An increase in resources of £3·8 million is
              sought for the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister. Some £2 million of that increase relates to provision
              for the North/South Ministerial Council, the Civic Forum, the
              Planning Appeals Commission and the Water Appeals Commission. The
              balance is required to meet the cost of departmental
              administration, foot-and-mouth-disease advertisements, the
              increased provision for the Equality Commission for Northern
              Ireland and the European Union Peace programme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the additional resource requirement is
              adjusted to a cash basis, and capital expenditure is taken into
              account, the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy Minister
              is seeking an additional cash sum of £3·6 million to fund
              expenditure on the Estimate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The total net additional resource requirement
              for the Northern Ireland Assembly is £1·4 million. That reflects
              the transfer of provision from resources to capital of £7·9
              million arising from the purchase and refurbishment of additional
              accommodation — principally, Ormiston House — and an increase
              in depreciation and capital charges of £9·3 million after the
              revaluation of existing assets and the purchase of additional
              assets. When the additional resources requirement is adjusted to a
              cash basis, the Northern Ireland Assembly is seeking additional
              cash of £90,000 to fund expenditure on the Estimate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In respect of the Northern Ireland Audit
              Office, and the Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and
              Northern Ireland Commissioner for Complaints, there are small
              increases of £49,000 and £13,000 respectively.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That deals with the resolution for the spring
              Supplementary Estimates. I will endeavour to answer Members’
              questions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will turn now to the second Supply resolution
              for the issue of an amount — that is, a cash sum — of £3,936
              million to be granted on account towards defraying the costs
              incurred by Departments and the use of resources of some £4,486
              million for the same purposes in the year 2002-03. The cash sum
              and the resource totals for which approval is sought represent a
              Vote on Account, pending the bringing forward of the Main
              Estimates to the Assembly in June. A Vote on Account at this point
              in the financial year, prior to the year in which the cash or
              resources will be used, is a normal feature of Government
              financial management. It arises because, after the Assembly’s
              approval of the Budget in December, detailed work has to be
              undertaken by Departments, and by the Department of Finance and
              Personnel, to disaggregate and allocate resource requirements for
              individual purposes, often through narrowly defined line entries.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Vote on Account reflects both the
              allocation of cash to Departments and the allocation, up to a
              limit, for the use of resources. As already explained, the Vote on
              Account takes account of the levels of expenditure agreed by the
              Assembly in the Budget and will be consistent with the figure work
              brought forward in the Main Estimates later this year. There will,
              of course, be an opportunity for a full debate on the details at
              that stage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the interim, the Vote on Account will fund
              Departments to implement the ongoing programmes and services for
              which they are responsible and which form part of the Budget
              decisions that were taken last December.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have said, this is the second occasion on
              which a Minister of Finance and Personnel has presented
              Supplementary Estimates to the Assembly. The devolved Assembly has
              again been able to make decisions for a complete financial year.
              We have also announced the first allocations from the Executive
              programme funds in this financial year. However, the Executive are
              conscious of the need to ensure that resources are targeted
              effectively. As Minister of Finance and Personnel, I intend to
              ensure that future financial recommendations continue to be
              subject to careful and detailed scrutiny — and to challenge, if
              necessary.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly and the Committees have a vital
              role to play in these processes. I am committed to doing all that
              is possible to ensure that Members can fulfil their
              responsibilities effectively. In that context, I have noted that
              the Committee for Finance and Personnel has expressed several
              concerns about the process, the documentation and the time
              available for consideration of matters.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fully understand those concerns, and I
              acknowledge the need for further developments. We face real
              difficulties as a result of the timescale to which we must work. I
              will examine the scope for improvement, and I will work with the
              Committee to achieve that end in the months ahead. To assist us to
              ensure that we are targeting funding in the most appropriate way
              possible, we are carrying out a review of the Executive programme
              funds, which will inform our shaping of the future management and
              direction of those funds. We will continue to attach the highest
              priority to ensuring that we manage and control the resources that
              are available to us.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Through the Programme for Government and the
              Budget, we have the opportunity to set out our priorities and
              plans. Our challenge is to provide the highest-quality services to
              our citizens.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The detail of my statement is complex by its
              nature — perhaps it is made more complex by looking backwards
              while planning for the future, but it is appropriate that we do
              so. The Executive and the Assembly have achieved much in the past
              two years. We are getting to grips with the challenge of setting
              our own spending priorities and directing resources towards them.
              Our challenge is to continue to spend money in an efficient and
              effective way, so that the people whom we serve can see that we
              are making a difference. We have made a good start, and the
              advantages of devolution are on display in the Chamber this
              afternoon.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Achieving our aims for the future will not be
              easy or straightforward, and this will not be a comfortable year
              financially. We face a crucial spending review, which will
              conclude in the summer. Many Members appreciate that challenging
              the Barnett formula is not a no-risk option. Ministers and I will
              weigh these matters carefully before proceeding, and I will
              continue to value the advice of the departmental Committee and the
              Assembly before doing so.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Finance
              and Personnel (Mr Molloy):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
              thank the Minister for his statement and detailed explanation of
              the spring Supplementary Estimates. At its meeting on 5 February,
              the Committee for Finance and Personnel considered the near final
              proof document of the spring Supplementary Estimates for 2001-02
              and the Vote on Account for 2002-03. Department of Finance and
              Personnel officials appeared before the Committee to answer
              questions and to help it to navigate its way through those
              difficult issues. The documentation involved is dense.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee acknowledges that the format of
              the Estimates is naturally detailed and that the Minister
              inherited the current versions. The Committee also accepts that
              the introduction of resource accounting and budgeting has added a
              layer of detail to what was already a complicated financial
              document. The Committee is concerned about the short period
              provided for Committees to scrutinise the Estimates. It is also
              essential that the format of the Estimates be user-friendly so
              that the Assembly and its Committees can do their job effectively.
              Appropriate guidance must be made available to enable Members to
              make sense of the Estimates, which they are expected to approve,
              and to inform the public. Department of Finance and Personnel
              officials share that concern and have undertaken to address it.
              The Committee is concerned that that matter be progressed urgently
              and that the improvements are in place before the Main Estimates
              in June.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The timing of the debate and the arrival only
              this morning of the final version of the Estimates and the Vote on
              Account leave much to be desired. The Committee must not be taken
              for granted. It will not continue simply to be a rubber stamp for
              accelerated passage of the Budget Bill unless the Executive
              provide sufficient opportunity for consultation and scrutiny. That
              is a crucial issue. Last week the Committee considered the matter
              in detail before it approved the Bill’s accelerated passage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly must find ways to help Committees.
              Departments must co-operate with them to ensure that that happens.
              The Committee welcomed the Minister’s recent decision to review
              the effectiveness of the in-year monitoring procedure against the
              considerable quantum of reallocations. Departments already have
              problems in quantifying their budget needs. There is a danger that
              resources are being deployed and not spent. Those resources could
              be spent by other Departments and might have been more effectively
              allocated elsewhere in the first instance. The Assembly must
              examine budgeting and how it is followed up so that it targets the
              Departments that are most in need.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee urges the Minister to complete
              his review in time for the first monitoring round of the new
              financial year. It will look carefully at any proposals that
              emerge. The Committee accepts that the Estimates documentation may
              remain dense and complicated. There may be some advantage in the
              Department of Finance and Personnel providing for Committees and
              Members a training and awareness seminar on the subject. I wrote
              to the Minister to highlight those issues on 7 February. I hope
              that he will be able to respond positively to the Committee’s
              concerns. Although the Committee for Finance and Personnel
              accepted the accounting nature of the Supply Resolutions and has
              formally written to the Speaker to approve the accelerated passage
              of the Budget Bill under Standing Order 42, the Minister and the
              Executive must reflect on the concerns that were raised, and about
              which I spoke earlier. The process must be remedied in time so
              that the situation can be rectified before the Main Estimates in
              June.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Speaking as a Member from west of the Bann, not
              as a Committee Chairperson, I reiterate some issues. The Assembly
              must examine the lack of health facilities, poor infrastructure,
              poor school buildings and all the other issues that were targeted
              as priorities in the Programme for Government. Proper budgeting by
              Departments is necessary. It is noticeable that £198 million is
              reallocated in various ways by Committees under the monitoring
              rounds. That money is recycled several times. If, at the outset,
              that money had been allocated in Budget form to the Department
              that needed it most, the continuous monitoring rounds might
              involve less money. This is not new money — as the Minister said
              several times — it is money that has been regurgitated. We must
              examine this issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly has three priorities, health,
              education and infrastructure, and these are needed most west of
              the Bann. The money must be correctly allocated, and I am glad
              that the Minister agrees that there must be a review of that
              procedure. The Assembly must address the imbalance that exists
              between the areas east and west of the Bann. The west of the Bann
              has been neglected for years by Unionists in the old Stormont
              Parliament and by the British Government during direct rule. This
              situation must be changed if the Assembly is to signal new ways of
              moving forward. We must redress the balance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must ensure that New TSN is not just about
              the three letters &quot;T&quot;, &quot;S&quot; and &quot;N&quot;.
              We must ensure that we are targeting social need where it arises.
              Unfortunately, this approach was not followed during the
              allocations of European funding. Although that is not the Minister’s
              direct responsibility in his present role, it is part of the
              Department of Finance and Personnel’s remit. How is a situation
              dealt with whereby an area west of the Bann is depopulated over
              years and then population is used as an indicator for allocating
              European funds? The indicator has been a failure. Depopulation has
              caused the west to suffer in relation to jobs, housing,
              infrastructure and economic development. If budgets are to target
              social need, the Assembly must put itself in a position to address
              this problem. The present system is not doing that. We are simply
              doing what has been done in the past and following the same
              patterns.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Timescales are too short. Committees do not
              have enough time to scrutinise Budgets and develop their ideas.
              Departments do not have time to think through new policies. I had
              hoped that this could have happened with respect to the Executive
              programme funds, but it has not. Executive programme funds are
              being allocated in the same way as normal budgeting rounds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will return to the monitoring rounds. A total
              of £198 million is being recycled year after year. If health were
              to be prioritised, we could allocate that money to the Department
              at the beginning of the budgeting round to address the imbalance.
              Over time we could prioritise housing, education and
              infrastructure instead of simply recycling money. If the Assembly
              did that, it would start to redress the balance of the past. If it
              cannot do that, the Assembly will fail.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the new rounds each Department and Committee
              must take this situation into account when they are in the bidding
              process, and not simply wait until this stage, which is merely a
              rubber-stamping exercise. We must look at departmental bids. Are
              they targeting social need? Is the money going where it should, or
              are Departments budgeting for things that they may want to
              implement but cannot deliver?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask Committee members to ensure that they are
              involved in the process and that they receive the information. I
              hear, through the Chairpersons Liaison Committee, that Members
              cannot get information from relevant Departments. Members are
              entitled to that information. I urge them to get the relevant
              information and become involved in the bidding process, so that
              the Assembly is not simply rubber-stamping the Budget at the end
              of the process. In that way, we can address the imbalance and make
              good progress for the future. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to place on record my sincere thanks to
              the Minister of Finance and Personnel for the detailed
              presentation of the spring Supplementary Estimates, and also for
              touching on the Budget for 2002-03.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the greatest problems in any Budget
              debate in Northern Ireland is that we are, as someone recently put
              it, seeking pieces of a pre-baked cake, in that we have very
              little or almost no ability to expand our revenue and hence to
              expand our expenditure. Quite correctly, there are, and will be,
              considerable tensions between Departments in seeking the maximum
              share of the cake.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assume — and I hope that the Minister will
              confirm this — that it is the Executive’s collective
              responsibility to determine the priorities to which the various
              sectors of the cake are allocated. In other words, is there
              corporate responsibility within the Executive for the budgets now
              being put before us? Added revenue resulting from each proposition
              made by any Department must, because of the finite cake, be taken
              from some other Department or cause. It is incumbent on any
              Minister or any Member who asks for additional resources to have
              the courage to indicate where those resources should come from.
              Otherwise it is a glib question, and we should not raise people’s
              hopes on various financial matters that are not in the control of
              the Assembly or the Executive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In that frame of mind, I assume that the
              Minister can confirm that the Minister for each Department agrees
              with the Budget, with the Supplementary Estimates for 2001-02 and
              the proposals for 2002-03.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Time and time again I am surprised when certain
              individual Ministers claim that in some way they have been
              deprived of resources to do x, y or z. I have always assumed —
              and if I am wrong I hope that the Minister will correct me —
              that each Minister agrees to his or her own budget and to the
              totality of the Budget. In that process there must be give and
              take, but that is the position, and we must therefore desist from
              passing the buck to other Departments or Ministers. Otherwise, the
              Minister should explain that our 10 Departments are independent
              and not related at all, but I do not believe that for a minute.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In general terms, however, we must question
              where we can expand the resources available to us. We should
              pursue possible alternative sources of revenue, either within or
              without our jurisdiction. I am not ashamed to admit that I would
              seek additional resources from other countries on the grounds that
              they understand our problems, that they have been sympathetic and
              that they have contributed in the past. Only now do we evaluate
              the huge shortfall in almost every Department as a result of the
              years of direct rule. Time and again the enormity of the lack of
              infrastructure and basic capital expenditure during that time
              comes to the fore. I note that the Minister in his introduction
              indicated at least an amber light in respect of the Barnett
              formula, although he advised us to weigh up the risk options when
              dealing with that problem. However, off the cuff it looks as if
              that is the only option we have at the moment — risks and all
              — whether we like it or not, in the hope that fair play and
              justice will win in the end.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On top of that, multimillion pounds of
              additional funding are announced from time to time for roads or
              health by the Exchequer in London. Does an appropriate part of
              that filter down to the Government and Departments in Northern
              Ireland? I am not very sure that it does.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maximising parallel funding is another
              important area that we should engage in strenuously, not only at
              Executive administrative level but at local government level. Time
              and time again I hear rumours — although I seldom hear the facts
              — that European funding, which requires parallel funding from
              the Exchequer, cannot come into play either because of the absence
              of parallel funding or, sometimes, because of the lack of
              efficient administration and appropriate application. The Assembly
              has a duty to assist local authorities, of whatever nature, when
              they seek external funding. We must offer them expertise and
              advice, and open their lines of communication.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that the amount indicated for
              2002–03 is not the final allocation, and I am sure that we shall
              return to the various sectors during debates in the early summer
              and the autumn.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be inappropriate for a Member to speak
              in such a debate and to be completely global in his or her
              remarks. Therefore, it may be that I have an excuse to be slightly
              parochial for a moment, but I shall try to apply a general thesis.
              Will the Minister, or the appropriate Minister, confirm that, if a
              hospital construction is programmed to take place immediately
              after the Hayes review, it should be specific in the Estimates for
              2002-03 at this stage? If not, I presume that any comment to the
              contrary would be false, especially in view of the fact that the
              money for Downe Hospital has, allegedly, been available for four
              years. However, as I am unaware of its being reallocated to
              another project, I presume that it was never there. That is
              another story.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the question of the strong
              promises that were made for the Mourne health facility that was
              demolished six years ago and was to have been replaced. Again,
              that is not the Minister of Finance and Personnel’s
              responsibility, but if after six years it is not in a funding
              programme, I wonder whether the project is capable of delivery in
              the allocated time frame.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is there any scope to introduce free
              residential care for the elderly? The issue is twofold. First,
              there is the obvious benefit that residential care creates.
              Secondly, Members know that many beds that could serve other
              purposes are tied up locally because hospitals are unable to
              discharge the elderly into their communities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy mentioned educational allocation. Is
              the concept of equality proofing and rural proofing fully applied
              to all the allocations across the sectors? Mr Molloy referred to
              some sectors; I refer to all sectors because it must be applied to
              all Departments.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the hon Gentleman clear about what rural
              proofing really means? We have been seeking a definition from the
              Department of Agriculture and Rural Development for many months,
              and we have not been given an answer.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know whether to thank the Member for
              his intervention, because I cannot answer his question.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a concept of rural proofing. I know
              what I mean when I use the term &quot;rural proofing&quot;. I am
              not aware of any departmental definition of the term, but it has
              been talked about a great deal in the Executive’s Programme for
              Government and in relation to the concept of equality. The Noble
              indices have been introduced to show shortfalls in social
              resources, and my guess is that rural communities, in particular,
              are under-represented as regards allocations. It is easier to
              focus on the visible deprivation in urban areas, but deprivation
              is often not as apparent in rural communities. That is why I am
              anxious that this aspect of rural proofing be applied urgently to
              the allocations in all Departments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equality and rural proofing are also relevant
              to the Department for Regional Development. The Assembly has
              recently debated the Department’s transport policy and other
              policies and, speaking as a representative of south-east Ulster, I
              think that it is becoming apparent that there is a shortfall in
              allocations to these programmes and intentions in that area. I
              cannot go into detail about that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fishing is often not mentioned, although it is
              the responsibility of the same Department as agriculture. Fishing
              is a major industry in my constituency. Will there be provision in
              the 2002-03 Estimates for a new policy for agricultural
              development? There is a vision group paper on the subject, which
              is at consultation stage and which will be addressed in detail in
              the next couple of months. However, in the aftermath of BSE,
              foot-and-mouth disease and the crisis with international exchange
              rates and the green pound, it is essential that we have a
              definitive policy, backed by finance, to allow those who wish to
              retire from farming to do so with dignity and a degree of
              financial and social security.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also have the ability to introduce new
              blood to the agriculture industry by providing, for example, a
              scheme similar to the Dutch one. Such a scheme would allow new
              entrants who are well trained, well versed in farming, modern
              technologies and trade techniques to be brought into the farming
              industry. Unless we have such a vision for agriculture, backed by
              finance, we will simply be treading water.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very tempting to speak about all
              Departments, Mr Speaker, but you will frown upon me if I speak for
              much longer. I hope that we have an opportunity to address some
              fundamental policy issues so that we can re-resource and
              reallocate funding for 2002-03. Aside from the urgent need to
              spend current Budget allocations within the current financial
              year, of which there are about five or six weeks remaining, there
              is not much that we can do about initiating and paying for new
              schemes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the often-repeated announcements from the
              Blair/Brown axis that millions of pounds of additional resources
              are being put into roads, education and health, can we be assured
              that we will get a real and meaningful share of that money, backed
              up by compensation for the shortfall that we suffered under years
              of direct rule? That is my central concern.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can we also look for alternative resources with
              which to build a bigger cake, so that Departments can be given a
              bigger slice to deal with their various requirements? The
              principles of the Barnett formula are difficult to grasp, but
              there is no point in dealing with that issue today. However, I
              hope that at the end of that we will have an outcome that will
              substantially enhance the resources available to Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister confirm that the spring
              Supplementary Estimates, and the Estimates for 2002-03, are the
              consequences of an agreed Budget, reflecting the input of every
              Minister who signs up to and agrees with it? Furthermore, does the
              Minister agree that, in principle, it is totally wrong for a
              Minister to say that they were not given x or y by another
              Minister? Responsibility for the Budget is either collegiate or it
              is not. If it is not, I would like to know that so that I can
              handle the matter differently. If responsibility is collegiate,
              Ministers making statements outside the House should show more
              honesty and integrity.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement negotiated last year between
              management and teachers on the teachers’ salaries and conditions
              of service committee recognises that there should be appropriate
              salary differentials. Under that agreement, a vice-principal’s
              salary range starts at a point above the salary of the
              highest-paid teacher in the school. In turn, the first point on
              the principal’s salary range must be higher than the top point
              of the vice-principal’s salary range.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem lies in reaching agreement on
              appropriate differentials, given the differences between schools
              in management structures, job weights and existing pay
              differentials. The employing authorities and my Department have
              been working hard on guidance for boards of governors on the pay
              arrangements for principals and vice-principals. Although this has
              not been a straightforward task, it is expected that the guidance
              will issue very shortly. Any consequential pay changes for
              principals and vice-principals will be backdated to 1 September
              2000.</p>

              years, when others were hell-bent on destruction, now deserve to
              see a tangible reward for their loyalty and dedication? Also, does
              the Minister consider it proper when a teacher at the top of her
              scale is promoted to the post of vice-principal and, as a
              consequence, is £500 less well off, or when two vice-principals
              now find themselves on a salary £1,500 lower than the
              highest-paid teacher in their school, or, indeed, when a teaching
              principal who worked in the evenings and over the weekends to
              ensure that his colleagues received their threshold increase has
              yet to be told when his differential will be restored?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the pay agreement was reached last year,
              priority was given to putting in place the arrangements for
              assessing eligible teachers and paying salary increases to those
              assessed as meeting the standards. Principals, assessors and the
              employing authorities have done an excellent job in completing
              almost all the assessments, and some 70% of successful teachers
              have now been paid. The new arrangement for vice-principals has
              not yet been implemented because of the priority given to
              threshold assessments. When it is implemented shortly, all
              vice-principals will receive more than their teachers, and the
              awards will be backdated to the same date as that applying to

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I personally have not had discussions with my
              Colleague, the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public
              Safety, on this issue. However, the procedures are as follows. The
              Disabled Persons (Northern Ireland) Act 1989 requires education
              and library boards to refer pupils in special schools to the
              relevant health and social services trust at age 14 for an opinion
              as to whether they come within the scope of the Act and are,
              therefore, likely to require further care when they leave school.
              The special education legislation imposes certain duties on boards
              regarding transition planning. My Department’s code of practice
              on the identification and assessment of special educational needs
              provides further advice on the process. Boards are required to
              inform trusts about a young person leaving special school up to a
              year in advance.</p>

              procedures. The issue is clearly of major concern and another area
              was highlighted in the press at the weekend.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before the Disabled Persons (Northern Ireland)
              Act 1989, special schools under the control of health and social
              services boards appear to have had much greater co-ordination with
              sheltered workshops and adult centres than they have now. Is it
              acceptable that, because of difficulties with provision, young
              people are thrown out of the only available care for them in
              special schools before alternative care is provided?</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Education and library boards are required to
              notify health and social services boards and trusts for an opinion
              on whether young people in special schools who reach the age of 14
              are disabled according to the Disabled Persons (Northern Ireland)
              Act 1989 and may, therefore, require further care on leaving
              school. That happens at least two years, but more commonly five
              years, before such young people leave school. I cannot see any
              merit in earlier notification, although we are all responsible for
              examining those issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health and social services trusts may wish to
              approach the education and library boards about that specific
              problem to see if opportunities exist for the use of school
              facilities out of school hours. For example, special schools’
              assembly halls could be used for sports or drama activities,
              specialist rooms could be used for home economics, art, craft and
              technology, and it might be possible to use hydrotherapy pools, if
              they were available. That would, of course, be subject to
              agreement between the trust, the board and the school.</p>

              academic selection. The weaknesses of the current selective
              arrangements were evidenced by the research undertaken by Prof
              Gallagher, Prof Smith, Save the Children and Prof Gardiner. The

              results, there will be rejoicing in many families, but it is
              important to remember that there will be great disappointment and
              a sense of failure in many more.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Academic selection and the transfer test mean
              that two thirds of our children are deemed to be failures, which
              puts undue pressure on pupils, parents and teachers. For that
              reason there is widespread demand for the abolition of the test.
              We now have an opportunity to consider new post-primary
              arrangements that will value and cherish all children equally.
              They will open up options rather than close them down, and they
              will avoid having the majority of our children regarded as
              failures at the age of 11. To do so, we must address the issue of
              academic selection.</p>

              believe that selection by postcode, and the financial inequity

              excellence, equality and choice for all children. I do not want to
              disadvantage children in particular areas. The issue of proximity
              as the final criterion has raised particular concern, but it is
              important to remember that the majority of secondary schools and
              over half the grammar schools already use this criterion as a
              tie-breaker. However, as part of the consultation process, I would

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much work has been done on this issue over some
              time. The work carried out by Prof Tony Gallagher and Prof Alan
              Smith at Queen’s University Belfast and the University of Ulster
              made clear that the weaknesses of the current arrangements are
              unacceptable, and they must be addressed. Everybody, including the
              members of the Committee for Education, accepts that there is a
              need for change. Therefore, the status quo is not an option. The
              issue of academic selection must be addressed — that is at the
              heart of this debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a complacency about how well we
              perform compared with other countries. For example, the recent
              Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study of
              reading, mathematics and science showed that we performed no
              better than England and Scotland. We were well behind other
              industrialised countries. The top performers — countries such as
              Finland and New Zealand — had non-selective systems.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of the countries surveyed, we also have one of
              the widest ranges of performance. Within these islands, Scotland,
              which has a comprehensive system, has as many pupils gaining five
              GCSEs at grades A* to C and a similar proportion of young people
              entering higher education. England, which is often caricatured as
              having a failed comprehensive system, has a higher proportion of
              pupils achieving five GCSE passes at grades A to G than here in
              the North. Although we have more pupils who gain higher grade
              passes than in England, we also have more pupils who gain few
              passes at any grade. That highlights the wide range of achievement
              created by our academically selective system. We must face up to
              the fact that it is a system that does very well for some but
              poorly for many.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is intended that working groups of officials
              will be established by the end of February. No decisions have been
              taken on any of the proposals in the Burns review, and no team has
              been set up to implement them. A small team comprising six
              officials, including support staff, has been established to manage
              the consultation, to receive and analyse comments and to introduce
              proposals for decisions in due course.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That consultation will be vital. I ask
              everybody with an interest in education to make a response to the
              consultation process by 28 June. It will be a real consultation.
              As an important aid to discussion, my Department intends to bring
              out a video which will be widely seen and will be followed by a
              pamphlet, which will be widely distributed, to give people an
              opportunity to respond on this important matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department is also looking at ways in which
              it can reach those who are less articulate and who might have
              difficulty responding. It intends to make the consultation process
              as easy as possible. The work is important and getting it right
              will be one of the most important tasks that the Assembly will
              have to face in its first term. Every Member has a responsibility
              to play his or her part. This is not about structures; it is about
              putting in place the best possible education system for children
              in a modern world. That is why I hope that there will be no
              politicking on the issue and that people will face up to the
              challenges and recognise that they can do a great service to
              society, teachers, pupils and parents by getting this right.</p>

              supplementary questions from the other side of the House that
              there are many who do not see the need for change or recognise
              that the academic selection system has been a failure, even with
              the amount of consultation that has taken place so far — and
              there has been much consultation. Does the Minister think that

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not underestimate the enormity and
              complexity of the task. I have been encouraged by an emerging
              consensus on the guiding principles that should be the basis of
              any new system, especially that of valuing all children equally.
              Those guiding principles centre round ending the transfer tests,
              the value of pupil profiles and the value of collaboration and
              co-operation between schools.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a common goal, which is to ensure that

              society. We must all work together to achieve that. I want to
              achieve maximum consensus, but, as Minister of Education, I will
              not shirk my responsibility to take firm decisions that are in the

              which are also facing severe accommodation difficulties — for
              example, those in my constituency of Lagan Valley — will receive
              fair and equitable consideration when decisions are made? How will
              the Minister achieve this?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are very careful about how we move forward
              in all these matters, and I understand the sensitivities. However,
              the criteria and methodology for determining the school capital
              building programme are applied to all contenders. It is important
              that the education and library boards, the Council for Catholic
              Maintained Schools (CCMS) and other schools authorities ensure at
              an early stage that their work on economic appraisals is
              sufficiently advanced for schools in their sectors to be
              considered for inclusion in the programme. The Department can
              consider schools only at that stage so that they can be assessed
              on their merits as regards educational need. That takes into
              account such factors as deficiencies in accommodation, the extent
              and condition of temporary accommodation, the ability of the
              school to meet the requirements of the curriculum, health and
              safety concerns in relation to mechanical, electrical and other
              areas of provision and the cost of maintaining the existing
              building fabric. This has to reflect the fact that the cost has to
              be affordable and contained within the resources available.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have visited schools with pressing
              accommodation requirements. Indeed, I have visited more than one
              school, and I am conscious of the backlog of work that has to be
              caught up on. Some £500 million would be required to even begin
              to examine all those issues. I am under no illusions about the
              great difficulties faced by all school sectors. However, I can
              assure the House that decisions about capital support for schools
              and the school capital building programme are made solely on the
              basis of educational need. The criteria that I have outlined are
              the way forward, and they have been arrived at in consultation
              with the schools’ inspectorate, the education and library boards
              and the CCMS. I am also conscious of the situation in the
              Hillsborough area, and I am dealing with that as a matter of high
              importance.</p>

              consideration? If so, how will Johnny Citizen know that that has
              been taken on board, and in what way will it be open to discussion

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation facing rural schools is
              particularly close to my heart. There is a responsibility on all
              of us to ensure that all schools are treated equally and that
              decisions are taken solely on the basis of educational need.
              Rurality of schools needs to be taken into account. I will be
              meeting the Committee for Education in the next couple of weeks,
              and we will discuss all those matters. It is important to be fair
              and to treat people with due respect. On my visits to schools, I
              have seen the great pressures that many boards of governors,
              schools authorities, principals, parents and teachers are under
              because of poor accommodation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Accommodation is a high priority for my
              Department, and I have consistently fought the battle in the
              Executive for more resources. It is vital that we put in place
              proper accommodation so that we can offer the best possible
              environment for children to be educated in a sensible fashion. All
              those matters will be taken into account, but I must stress that
              the main criterion for the school capital building programme is
              educational need.</p>

              determined on the basis of educational need, whether that be at
              controlled schools, voluntary schools or in any other school
              sector. I heard the point being made about &quot;three to
              one&quot;, so the Member who made that allegation should listen
              carefully. The make-up of this year’s conventional school
              building programme was six Catholic maintained school projects
              costing £25·7 million, 10 controlled school projects costing
              £24·1 million — including two special schools that were the
              top capital priorities of two education and library boards — and
              one grant-maintained integrated school costing £12·5 million.
              People who make such allegations need to examine those figures,
              and they need to be fair. They must stop peddling the nonsense
              that we will give preferential treatment to one school sector when
              decisions are taken about allocations to schools in the capital
              building programme. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am totally committed to the application of
              New TSN principles to address social deprivation wherever it is
              found. My Department’s New TSN action plan includes an objective
              to improve the targeting and effectiveness of funding for schools
              in order to raise achievement levels. At present, I have no plans
              to adopt the Noble indicators when assessing schools’ needs. The
              needs of schools with high levels of socially disadvantaged pupils
              were addressed as part of my Department’s consideration of a
              common funding formula for schools. In that context, we examined
              the possibility of using Noble and other similar indicators as a
              means of allocating funds for social deprivation under the TSN
              factor in the proposed new common funding formula.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need a robust and objective indicator, which
              is pupil oriented, to tackle social deprivation — principally
              because pupils do not always attend their nearest school. The
              Noble indicators are location based and, therefore, cannot be used
              to target resources in schools with socially deprived children in
              attendance. Entitlement to free school meals remains the most
              robust indicator of social deprivation, and that is a view widely
              supported by schools in the recent consultation. I have stated my
              willingness to keep the issue under review and to utilise more
              effective indicators should they become available.</p>

              Social Care Trust have been transferred from the Tyrone County
              Hospital in the past, the uptake has not reflected that expected
              in the conglomeration of the two services. Patients are voting
              with their feet, and in the Tyrone County Hospital side they are

              That is their right and their choice. However, the boards and
              trusts continually review their services to reflect demand, and
              they occasionally reconfigure services according to that demand. I
              have received an assurance from the trust that any sort of
              reconfiguration or realignment that takes place between winter and
              summer, or at any stage, to reflect demand will have no negative

              for junior doctors and will reduce or eliminate inappropriate
              tasks being carried out by them. The junior doctors met with the
              Chief Medical Officer at the end of last year. They have frequent
              meetings at official level, one of which is scheduled for later
              this week. They have representation on the ISG, which meets

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I share the Member’s concerns. A recent
              survey of all trusts and boards indicated that 70% of junior
              doctors are working in posts that are non-compliant with the hours
              and rest requirements of the new deal. That is why I have made
              certain that the work of the implementation support group, and any
              other work that can be done, will be done in order to meet those
              requirements. I commend the work of all of those who are working
              hard to ensure that arrangements are those that junior doctors and
              others should expect. This year’s key priority is that full
              compliance with the new deal is achieved for all pre-registration
              house officer posts by August.</p>

              Government, published in February 2001, stated that the public
              consultation for the ‘Investing for Health’ strategy was to be
              completed, and that by September 2001 an implementation plan was
              to be published. It is now February 2002, and we are still no
              further forward. With such dragging of feet, is it any wonder that
              the Health Service is in its current state?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consultation period was to end on 10 April
              2001. However, because of difficulties in organising consultation
              events in rural areas as a result of foot-and-mouth disease, it
              was decided to extend the consultation period until 31 May. Even I
              am not responsible for foot-and-mouth disease. In the last plenary
              debate before the Christmas recess, one Member suggested that I
              was almost responsible for the Ulster fry and the amount that
              people in Ireland drink. However, to hold me responsible for
              foot-and-mouth disease is to take a step too far.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, the ministerial group on public
              health agreed that a feedback conference would form an integral
              part of the consultation process, as that would inform respondents
              about the outcomes of the consultation and provide a final
              opportunity for comment. Having extended the consultation period
              until 31 May, it was not then feasible, if community
              representatives were to be included, to hold that conference
              during the summer. The conference was eventually held on 5
              October.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development of the strategy has since
              involved the co-ordination of input from all Departments, and the
              consideration of the draft strategy by a quality assurance group.
              As the Member knows, I chair the ministerial group on public
              health. Representatives on that group also include senior
              officials from every Executive Department. It will consider the
              final draft of the strategy at its meeting on Wednesday before

              the uncertainty of many parents about the safety of the MMR
              vaccine. Does the Minister agree that overwhelming evidence and

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consultation was covered in my response to Mr
              McCarthy’s question. The implementation strategy will have
              several stages, but we see it as the future way of working. For it
              to succeed, there must be an effective partnership at every level.
              For the foreseeable future the ministerial group on public health
              will work with a variety of Departments to ensure that health
              factors are given due consideration in all areas of
              responsibility. In addition, the four health and social services
              boards will also lead local ‘Investing for Health’
              partnerships to identify opportunities to improve the health of
              the people in their area by addressing the social, cultural,
              economic and environmental determinants of health. They will
              develop long-term, local, cross-sectoral health improvement plans,
              again with short-term and longer-term targets. In the statutory
              sector, district councils, the Housing Executive, education and
              library boards, and health and social services trusts will all be
              included in those partnerships. Beyond those core members, the
              composition of the partnerships will be determined locally and is
              likely to evolve over time. The idea behind that is that in future
              the work of the strategy will become an integral part of the
              planning and outworking of policy in all areas — not only in
              health.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some implementation is immediate. I will
              shortly announce the community grants programme. Some will take
              slightly longer; the setting up of local partnerships will take
              place in the coming months. The most important part will be to
              establish a new way of working, in keeping with the Executive’s
              Programme for Government. For the foreseeable future interim
              targets will be regularly monitored.</p>

              social services trusts outside school hours, subject to local
              agreement? If so, will she follow up that ministerial initiative
              and ensure that funds are provided to community health and social
              services trusts to enable the use of school facilities to provide

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the pressure on statutory day
              care facilities, particularly as a result of the factors that the
              Member raised, and also because of the increasing number of people
              with severe disabilities who are unable to access alternative day
              facilities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is for the health and social services boards
              and trusts to assess need and provide the appropriate range and
              volume of services. That is why I outlined the arrangements in my
              opening answer. Those arrangements are between the education and
              library boards and the health and social services boards and
              trusts, and I am certain that the boards and trusts will wish to
              follow up any suggestion of facilities that might be made
              available. That raises the question of whether that would
              automatically mean that they could provide appropriate facilities
              or that there would be funding available for them. They need to
              examine all that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is for the relevant boards and trusts to
              inform themselves of the needs of those leaving special schools in
              their areas and to plan to meet those needs. I understand that
              funding is needed for day care and for a range of other health and
              social services, and I will examine that with a view to allocating
              additional funding in 2002-03. I will announce my decisions in due

              Catholic, although the community is 70% Protestant. Coming from a
              background of unfair allocations, how can we expect equity and

              population is used as a measure, along with the Noble indicators,
              which do not target social need.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How does he explain the exclusion of large
              areas that were targeted by Noble as being deprived? The
              allocations to the district partnership boards have been reduced
              by £1 million.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said earlier that there was widespread
              consultation on the Noble indicators, and that the Committee was
              involved in that consultation. It received presentations from
              officials in my Department. I will examine Hansard, and if I was
              inaccurate, I will ensure that that is corrected. I stressed that
              agreement on the use of the indicators was reached in the
              Executive, which includes two Ministers from the Member’s party.
              I reiterate that point, because in an earlier debate Mr McGrady
              raised the matter of collective responsibility. We need to ensure
              that collective responsibility for Executive decisions is fully
              respected.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development of the Noble indicators was a
              complex process. The index includes all the factors related to
              deprivation, and, appropriately, it relates those factors to the
              size of the population of an area. The allocations are then made
              on the basis of the indicators that are provided for each district
              council area. There has been concern about the matter, but the
              Member can receive again, through his Committee, a detailed
              presentation of all the issues related to the Noble indicators, if
              he and his Committee so wish. All Members are invited to gain
              information on how the indicators and the factors related to them
              were arrived at, and on their application.</p>

              using the Noble indicators of multiple deprivation in spending
              reviews and to influence decisions, why is the Minister of
              Education using different indicators in spending programmes? Does
              the Minister agree that the indicators should have been subject to
              a full, open debate in the House, and will he give a commitment to
              have such a debate?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said before, the Noble indicators were
              developed and agreed as the basis upon which the allocations under
              Peace II programmes would be made. It is not possible to reopen
              the basis upon which those allocations are made. As I said in my
              previous response, Members can become fully informed about all the
              factors related to deprivation that inform the development of the
              Noble indicators. That would at least help Members to understand
              that, as a result of the widespread consultation, there seems to
              have been wide acceptance of the weighting of all those factors,
              in rural and urban areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise that the way in which they are

              therefore, that there is no question of a return. However, I want

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The treatment of structural funds expenditure
              is based on the principle that receipts from the European
              Community should be managed, disbursed and monitored in exactly
              the same way, and using the same systems, as our own public
              expenditure. The basic principles of Government accounting apply
              to European Community receipts. In Northern Ireland the community
              structural fund monitoring committee has an overarching role
              across our structural funds programmes to ensure effective

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research
              Agency (NISRA) has developed robust statistics to help Departments
              identify underlying trends and areas for more in-depth analysis by
              age, grade and gender. For example, those statistics revealed that
              the female absence rate is twice as high as the male one, and that
              has an impact on absenteeism at the level of administrative
              officer, which is predominately female. A copy of the report ‘Analysis
              of Sickness Absence in the Northern Ireland Departments, 2000-01’
              by NISRA is available in the Assembly Library.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department also assists other Departments in
              tackling absenteeism through a range of corporate initiatives,
              including the development of a web site called ‘Attendance
              Matters’ for staff and managers. Service-wide seminars and
              workshops on managing attendance, as well as an awareness leaflet
              on support and early-return mechanisms, are available to Northern
              Ireland Civil Service staff. However, in that context it is
              important to bear in mind that approximately 80% of all lost
              working days were supported by a doctor’s certificate.</p>

              the matter seriously, that web sites are being developed and that
              additional training is being provided. Does the Minister agree
              that such high levels of absenteeism are unacceptable? They are
              almost three times higher than those in the private sector, as
              illustrated in a recent Confederation of British Industry (CBI)
              survey. Furthermore, will he confirm that high levels of
              absenteeism place additional burdens and stresses on those members
              of the Civil Service who are at work serving the general public?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an issue that must be approached
              sympathetically. It is notoriously difficult to carry out
              meaningful comparisons with other organisations, in both the
              public and the private sectors, for a variety of reasons. Sick
              absence rates are often calculated on a different basis and do not
              allow for factors such as the gender and age profile or the volume
              of part-time working to be taken into account, all of which have
              been shown to have an impact on absenteeism rates. Similarly, a
              recent CBI survey identified that company size is a key
              determinant of absence rates, with the smallest firms having a
              sick absence rate of approximately 40% less than the largest ones.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can assure the Member that Departments are
              not at all complacent about this. As he acknowledged in his

              Funding of Roads Service capital schemes and prioritising spending
              of the capital budget for roads are matters for the Minister for

              Minister of Finance and Personnel. Any request by a Minister for
              additional funding is a matter for consideration by the Minister

              much. He should understand that the roads’ infrastructure
              throughout the Province is in a state of grave neglect. The
              Executive must give higher priority to the Department for Regional
              Development when funds are being allocated to enable schemes such
              as the Magherafelt bypass to become a reality. It has been in the
              15-year programme for many years. I am not asking the Minister in
              any way to suggest which road or scheme should have higher
              priority, but the allocations of money made by his Department to
              the Department for Regional Development are vital to getting this

              resources, once allocated, are spent where they are most needed.
              That is achieved through the in-year monitoring process, where
              spending is monitored by Departments with significant underspends
              — actual or forecast — being notified to the Department of
              Finance and Personnel on four specified occasions. At each point
              any spare capacity is reallocated, at the discretion of the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his reply, the Minister said that the Noble
              indices were being used to target and spend departmental moneys.
              The Minister of Education is not using the Noble indicators as a
              way of spending departmental moneys, and that issue needs to be
              raised.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a further point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.
              The Minister of Education said that he had consulted widely before
              coming to the conclusion that the Nobel indices were the best way
              of indicating social deprivation. The House has not had a chance
              to debate those issues, even though there has been wide
              consultation outside the House.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for
              Agriculture and Rural Development (Rev Dr Ian Paisley):</p>
              </font></b><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Agriculture and Rural
              Development has recommended over and over again that there should
              be an increase in Budget funds for animal disease compensation. I
              am glad that that problem has been mentioned in the Supplementary
              Estimates, and that there has been a call for extra funding.
              Neither I nor anyone else wants to be involved in the enormous
              subsidisation of a disease. We want the disease to be eradicated.
              However, the situation in the Province as regards brucellosis and
              TB is serious, and incidences of those diseases are on the rise.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Public Accounts Committee has highlighted
              the cost of brucellosis. However, TB is also an expensive disease.
              At a recent meeting of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural
              Development, it was revealed that £9·3 million had been paid in
              compensation for brucellosis, and £9 million for TB. An
              additional sum of £8·24 million was spent on testing and
              compensation administration costs. The Committee asked the
              question: if that is the expenditure, and the diseases are
              spreading, does the Department have the finances to continue to
              compensate farmers if their herds have those diseases? The reply
              was that the money would run out.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to know whether the Department of
              Agriculture and Rural Development, having taken a reading of what
              will happen with regard to those diseases, and if they continue to
              spread, has asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel if the
              money will be there? I am sure that the Minister of Finance and
              Personnel, coming from a rural district, knows what farmers would
              think if they had those diseases on their farms and animals had to
              be slaughtered. What will a farmer think if his neighbour receives
              compensation, and the Department turns round and tells him that
              the kitty has run out? Has the Department of Agriculture and Rural
              Development made the Minister officially aware of this problem? Is
              the request for increased finance likely to be enough to deal with
              the situation?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member appreciate that there are
              several farmers in Northern Ireland whose herds have been
              scrutinised by departmental officials, and that those officials,
              having evaluated the herds, have indicated in writing their value
              and, after the herd has been slaughtered, have withdrawn those
              offers of compensation? Does the Member accept that that causes
              severe problems for the image of the Department in the farming
              community, and severe problems for farmers in their relations with
              the banks?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a href="#top">TOP</a></p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of such situations, because they
              have happened in my constituency, which my son also represents in
              the House. We are all aware of such situations, and they
              constitute a serious matter. An even worse case was presented to
              me today. There was a foot-and-mouth disease scare, and the sale
              of certain cattle had been agreed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The animals were not paid for, but they were
              moved to the purchaser’s farm. However, the Department
              slaughtered all of them before he could pay for them. The man said
              that he had not paid for the animals, that they belonged to
              so-and-so and that therefore, technically, he was the owner. The
              owner then wrote to the Department and said that his herd had been
              slaughtered without his being informed. He said that he expected
              compensation, but the Department said that it could not pay him.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are the constituency matters that we deal
              with, and that is why it is so important that we know exactly what
              is happening. We take these matters up with the Minister and the
              Department because that is the first place we can go. We cannot
              expect the Finance Minister, with all his talents, brains and
              flatteries, to wave a magic wand. However, it is a matter of grave
              concern for farmers, and we should be concerned about the spread
              of brucellosis and TB. There was a time when the incidence of
              brucellosis and TB in the Province was very low. We have lost out
              badly. We need to eradicate diseases rather than compensate
              farmers with those diseases on their farms, and provision must be
              made for that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Committee has questioned if money will be
              available should the Minister decide that the vision report is to
              be acted upon and that the recommendations from the report are to
              move from the page and become reality. We have been told that
              there is no money available. The Minister set up a body to
              introduce important proposals on difficult situations in
              agriculture, yet no provision has been made to make money
              available to introduce the report’s recommendations. That too is
              very important.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a matter I wish to raise without
              wearing my Chairperson’s hat, although all members of the
              Committee are concerned about it. There is a need for a retirement
              scheme and a new entrants scheme for farmers. On the opposite
              Bench another man with great talents also raised the issue — and
              how could he not be with great talents, for we both sit in another
              place together? He made a very strong plea on the matter, and I
              want to back that up. There are men who have spent their days, and
              hoped to end their days quite comfortably, in farming, but that
              hope has been smashed. We all know about the state of agriculture.
              Can these men, in the last days of their lives, not retire with
              dignity and honour and have enough to live comfortably for
              whatever years are left to them? Is it unreasonable for us to say
              that they should?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also need new entrants, but many of the
              regulations that govern agriculture put a barricade in their way.
              We must oil the hinges, take off the locks, open the door and let
              new entrants in with a helping hand so that they can get to a
              place where they can earn a living from the soil.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an important issue, and I trust that
              the Minister will soon announce that it has been considered and
              that money will be available so that we can have a proper
              retirement scheme. It will cost a great deal of money, but new
              entrants to farming will ensure that the industry has a future.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the next time we discuss this

              People are working hard and are spending time carrying out tests
              and investigations. This is an important matter — £8·24
              million has been spent. This will be a thorough review of the
              situation, and I hope that they are successful. It is to be hoped
              that we will have the pleasant knowledge that brucellosis and
              tuberculosis have been conquered.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been said that a year is a long time in
              politics, and that time passes very quickly when one is enjoying
              oneself. It does not feel like a year since the last time we were
              discussing spring Supplementary Estimates, which was on 19
              February 2001. I stress that date, and I ask Members to bear it in
              mind.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remember the date vividly. At that time I
              drew attention to the need for change in how the Assembly went
              about its budgets and Supplementary Estimates. I remember drawing
              attention to the need for Members to have more time to analyse,
              scrutinise and deal with the topic in front of them. I also drew
              attention to the need for proper consultation, openness and
              transparency. I referred to the cold, harsh fact that we see the
              results of monitoring rounds retrospectively — as a fait
              accompli.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that time, the then Minister acknowledged
              these shortcomings, and he pointed out that resource accounting
              was coming on board and that it would enhance the accountability
              of Departments and help to address many concerns raised by
              Members. Today is 11 February 2002 — less than a year has
              passed. We have had less time to give the matter full scrutiny and
              less time for consultation. As I stressed, the equivalent debate
              last year took place on 19 February.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a full set of resource accounts for
              this year’s spring Supplementary Estimates. We have masses of
              figures in front of us — and I concede that point most
              willingly. However, I also openly admit to being more than a
              little blinded by the science of these figures. Again, I stress
              that more time should have been afforded to Members to properly
              get their heads around the new system of resource accounting.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been said that it is an improved system,
              and I acknowledge that. However, the system is improved only if it
              enlightens Members and helps them understand — on behalf of the
              taxpayer — the intricacies and accountability that is necessary
              if we are to perform a proper service on behalf of those who send
              us here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a complex system; a fact that has been
              recognised by the Minister, and I thank him for that recognition.
              However, we must continue to press, at Committee level and on the
              Floor of the House, for more transparency rather than allow
              transparency to appear to be an illusion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The spring Supplementary Estimates are
              effectively the consolidation of a done deal that, through the
              associated Budget Act, will provide the legislative authority to
              the Executive to spend taxpayers’ money.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stress again that we need to keep the
              pressure on, on the Floor of the House and at Committee level, in
              an attempt to prise open the vice-like grip on information that is
              held by someone or other.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last year, I highlighted other similarities,
              and I must question them again this year. The total figure in the
              Supplementary Estimate last year was £196 million —
              approximately 2% to 2·5% of the Main Estimate. I drew attention
              to that figure, as it was similar in percentage terms to that of
              the previous year. The figure this year is £198 million of cash
              required. Are these figures an amazing coincidence — is it
              lightning striking, not once or twice, but three times? Or are
              these figures, as I suspect, a planned calculation?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was advised last year that different factors
              that could not be predicted led to Supplementary Estimates of 2%
              to 2·5% of Main Estimate provisions. That may well be so, but I
              am not convinced that the current system leads to the best use of
              taxpayers’ money. I will expand on that point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members may recall that last year I called on
              each Department to consider releasing £10 million of its budget
              to assist in the crisis in the Health Service. That would have
              produced an additional £100 million to ease that crisis. The
              Ministers responded with shock and horror. I was told that it
              could not be done; it could not be afforded. The Executive
              acknowledged that health was recognised as a priority, and we all
              endorsed it, yet the other Departments needed every single penny
              they could get their hands on and knew how they were going to
              spend it on important issues. Yet, today, in the consolidation of
              the monitoring rounds, £198 million of easements are available in
              the system for reallocation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that monitoring rounds are
              effectively short-term money. I accept that.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member agree that when a financial
              crisis or issue arises in one of the Departments, miraculously, as
              I once described it, millions of pounds can be found down the side
              of the sofa and behind the clock? Is that what the Member is
              referring to?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is my point. I will go further than that.
              We have such a crisis in our number one priority that greater
              effort needs to be made in the lead-up to the beginning of the
              year to ensure that sufficient funds are allocated to that
              priority to deal with the pressures. We all know that those
              pressures are going to build up throughout the year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said before, each Department can put up a
              good argument as to why it should receive more money. That is not
              disputed — Northern Ireland has been underfunded for years.
              However, if we believe in a number one priority, then the Assembly
              must back up those words with resources. That has not been done,
              and continues to be neglected.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lead-in for financial resources requires time
              and planning to enable money to be spent. That is nowhere more
              obvious than in the Health Service. Over the past two years the
              funding has not been made available, and the crisis is getting
              worse.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently, I received a letter from the
              chairperson of the Northern Ireland office of the British Medical
              Association (BMA) which stated that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the crisis within the Health Service in
              Northern Ireland is escalating … I write to you to highlight the
              deep frustration and concern felt throughout the medical
              profession about the continuing crisis within the health service
              in Northern Ireland&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The letter makes several recommendations. I
              hope that all Members will concur with the recommendation that
              there should be an immediate review of the system of allocating
              funding in Northern Ireland, with the aim of replacing it with a
              more effective and accountable system. We should all say,
              &quot;Hear, hear&quot; to that. We have an opportunity to try to
              ensure that money is given according to our aspirations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we continue to follow what the previous
              Minister of Finance called &quot;the silo mentality&quot;, we will
              continue to push the problem down the pipe, rather than resolving
              it. We continue to fail to give proper prioritisation to the need
              for spending where it is needed. It hurts me that the Executive
              are still reticent to examine, recognise and grasp the necessity
              to implement the necessary changes. I hear words, but, after
              several years, I must question their sincerity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a new Minister of Finance. However, to
              clarify my point about words, when the Finance Committee was
              dealing with the Budget Bill, it received a letter on 15 February
              2001 from the Department of Finance and Personnel and signed by
              the then Minister, Mr Durkan. It says that</p>

              to work with the Committee to provide for further analysis and

              where the new thinking is. I want to stress the necessity for new
              thinking, rather than the repetition of words that are often
              meaningless. It is time for new thinking and for new ideas to be
              put to the test, rather than to continue with the patterns and the
              words of the past. It is time for change.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady called for new funds from outside
              Northern Ireland. I accept his points. Greater priority must be
              given to the needs of Northern Ireland, on a UK, a European and a
              worldwide basis. We are told that money is scarce. However, we
              have seen billions of pounds spent on war and killing, while the
              Health Service continues to crumble.</p>

              non-availability of funding in December&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could go on. All hospitals have reported bed
              availability problems as a result of delayed discharges. At the
              end of December 2001, community trusts reported that 136 elderly
              people were waiting for care packages, or for uplift to existing
              packages, due to no funding being available. Last year that figure
              was 126.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley spoke at length about concerns for
              animal health. That is justifiable. However, I emphasise the need
              for human health, and the need for the Assembly to deal with its
              resources in a more appropriate and effective manner that creates
              transparency and accountability and, more importantly, gives
              meaningful resolution to the problems that we face.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I referred to the need for external sources of
              funding. Again, I point to sources of funds within departmental
              budgets. Two or more years ago, the Executive talked about
              releasing funding because of the over-administration of Northern
              Ireland. Is there one less quango in Northern Ireland than there
              was when the Assembly was elected in 1998? The answer is
              &quot;No.&quot; We still have the skins of the onion — the 26
              local authorities, the many trusts, the health boards and the
              education boards — the layer upon layer of administration that
              is costing the taxpayer money. Examine the Estimates. Without
              exception, Departments’ administrative costs are increasing.
              Those are the areas on which the Assembly must concentrate in
              order to bring about some resolution. Unless that is done, the
              Assembly is kidding itself — and, more importantly, it is
              kidding the people that it is supposed to represent.</p>

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like many other Members, I spent the weekend
              poring over these figures. They threw up more questions than
              answers. I want to ask those questions in detail today. However, I
              would like to begin by pointing out the features of the document
              that the Women’s Coalition regards as positive in relation to
              the needs of Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The party welcomes the additional money that is
              going towards disabled access to, for example, schools and
              universities. That is a valuable area of expenditure. We welcome
              new expenditure on issues such as energy efficiency in schools. I
              hope that that is being extended to hospitals, particularly in the
              light of the high fuel costs indicated in the Budget. We also
              welcome additional funds for access to treatment for rheumatoid
              arthritis. Finally, I want to welcome the additional support for
              youth, community and housing security measures in north Belfast.
              Those are features of the Supplementary Estimates that I believe
              are valuable and that underline that the Assembly is working for
              the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClelland] in the
              Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am afraid that it goes downhill from there.
              There are areas of general concern in the document. Mr Close
              described that well when he spoke of being &quot;blinded by the
              science&quot;. Every Member has mentioned the highly complex
              procedure that they have been asked to comment on this afternoon
              — the monitoring, the Supplementary Estimates, the inclusion of
              Executive programme funds, and the new resource approach. All are
              highly complex. Every Member will echo my appeal to the Minister
              to adopt a much more user-friendly approach to reduce the
              complexity of those issues, and to make the process much more
              accessible and transparent, not only to ourselves but to members
              of the public. That is vital if we are to move forward in that
              area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the figures, certain Departments appear
              to be getting their sums right, yet others appear to be getting
              their sums badly wrong. I would appreciate some explanation for
              that. The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and the
              Department of the Environment are two Departments that have not
              asked for any additional funding. I assume that they are to be
              congratulated on getting their sums right. If that is incorrect, I
              would appreciate an explanation. With new resource accounting, the
              Department for Regional Development must account for roads. I
              appreciate the Minister of Finance and Personnel’s explanation
              of that in his opening statement. Health is obviously a crisis-led
              issue that I shall deal with later.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We assume that the Department of Finance and
              Personnel would surely get its sums right, as opposed to any
              other, as it is in the lead role in that area. However, that
              Department has asked for an additional £33 million because it did
              not get its sums right. I want that explained. That sum includes
              £19 million for pension payments and lump-sum benefits. The
              Department of Education and the Department of Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety also have sections on pensions and
              lump-sum benefits, but those Departments are not asking for
              additional money for those purposes. Am I to assume that civil
              servants are more in need of that additional money than teachers
              or nurses? I would appreciate an explanation of that, and of the
              Department of Finance and Personnel’s mathematical skills in
              particular.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During Question Time, I asked the Minister of
              Finance and Personnel about the reduction, by many millions of
              pounds, of funding under Peace I, which the report mentions, and
              whether European moneys have been returned to Brussels as a result
              of underspend. In his opening statement, the Minister guaranteed
              that that money will not go back to Brussels. I would appreciate
              hearing that again and again.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall go into more detail and cover each
              Department as it appears in the report. First, I turn to the
              Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. Dr Paisley
              highlighted the money that is to be spent on animal health, animal
              disease and compensation. I especially want to look at the £3·5
              million compensation paid out for brucellosis cases. The Minister
              is surely aware that the Public Accounts Committee is looking into
              that. The Committee has certain serious concerns about the
              brucellosis compensation and how it works. I underline that
              concern.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have not numbered the page to which I am
              about to refer, so I cannot quote the exact wording. However, I
              think that I am right in saying that the Department of Enterprise,
              Trade and Investment is looking for an additional £500,000 for
              what are called legal costs and consultancy fees for work on the
              introduction of the euro. That obviously fascinated me. Has that
              money already been spent? If so, how was it spent in advising the
              public about the introduction of the euro? Has the money yet to be
              spent? I would certainly welcome it if that were the case, but I
              want to know what will happen to that money when it becomes
              available.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moving to page 82 of the document, there are
              some concerns about the Department for Employment and Learning. In
              particular — and I imagine that having come from that Department
              the Minister well knows the subject — point (xii) states that
              New Deal provision is being reduced by some £5 million. I would
              appreciate an explanation of that. Long-term unemployment is a
              serious issue here, so should the Department’s strategic
              planning for tackling it not be better, with staff in place who
              could understand and deal with the backlog of some 7,000
              applicants?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety on page 94, my concern relates to a £10 million
              additional provision towards reducing the deficits of health and
              social services trusts. I understand that this is the first time
              such provision has been seen, and we voice our alarm at it. What
              is it? Does it involve GP fundholders or practices? An explanation
              would be appreciated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another concern is the £4·87 million
              increased provision</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why is money being moved from the Office of the
              First and Deputy First Ministers to the Department of Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety? Does the Office of the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister no longer have a budget for
              victims? Has its responsibility for victims been removed? What
              exactly happens to that money? Why is £105,000 being transferred,
              when the Budget provision is £150,000? An explanation would be
              appreciated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Assembly itself is dealt with on
              page 152. In respect of increased provision, I should appreciate a
              breakdown of the request for £1·4 million in additional funding
              for</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some £90,000 of the £1·39 million is needed
              in cash, and I would appreciate a breakdown of Assembly
              expenditure in that area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That completes my list of concerns. We went
              through the document with a fine toothcomb, and it was important
              to make those points.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To conclude, I agree with Mr Close that the
              knee-jerk, crisis-in-management approach to Budgets is
              inappropriate. Such adjustments and shifting about undoubtedly
              point to a greater need for a strategic approach to budgetary
              provision.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I repeat some figures that I used in the debate
              on the regional transport strategy last week. The 12,000 road
              traffic accidents, casualties and deaths per year in Northern
              Ireland cost the economy £450 million per year. Those figures
              must be mentioned on the Floor of the Assembly. I do not agree
              with Mr Close that money is scarce, but the lack of strategic
              provision is. Why do we spend time on crisis management, picking
              people out of the river, when it would be better to put someone
              upstream to stop them jumping in in the first place?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I rise entirely mindful that nothing that I
              might say, or indeed anything that anyone who appears to be
              vaguely critical of the proposals might say, will have the
              slightest effect. Come the vote, the marshalled ranks of the
              Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP will ensure that the motions
              are carried.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We heard two interesting speeches from the
              previous two contributors. However, they were interesting in
              entirely different ways. Mr Close addressed some of the
              fundamental issues that relate to the governance of Northern
              Ireland; Ms Morrice gave a virtuoso performance in the art of
              financial and political nit-picking. Of course, one can go through
              their accounts and pick up this, that and the other thing, but the
              major issues must be addressed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In financial and governance terms, Northern
              Ireland is a total mess. As a member of the electorate said to me
              recently, the Assembly appears to be a sort of theme park. It is a
              Disneyland, in which the political classes of Northern Ireland can
              play.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as the financial background of the
              governance of Northern Ireland is concerned, the fundamental
              mistake was made when those major parties involved in negotiating
              the Belfast Agreement failed to extract from the British
              Government a substantial contribution, amounting to billions of
              pounds, to address the shortfall in infrastructure that had
              occurred in the previous 10, 20 or, as has been suggested by some,
              30 years. That shortfall was believed to be in the region of £9
              billion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One lot was so interested in getting a devolved
              Assembly in order to get its hands on the levers of power that it
              entirely ignored that shortfall. The other lot was so interested
              in getting what it believed to be the extracting of transitional
              institutions for a united Ireland that it did not address the
              problem either.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The result, and the major financial problem
              with which the Assembly must cope, is how, on a limited budget, it
              can maintain the day-to-day financial demands and requirements
              without ever having the capital to address the huge deficit in
              infrastructure that it will never be able to address by saving
              money out of the annual operational costs in the block grant.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Take, for example, some of the problems in the
              Health Service to which Mr Close referred. Members know about the
              dreadful state of the orthopaedic services, paediatric services
              and cardiac units in Northern Ireland. It is not simply a question
              of pumping money for additional running cost into those
              institutions. Many of them do not have the appropriate capital
              investment in their infrastructure to deliver. I know of the
              recent case of a patient — not a National Health Service
              patient, but a BUPA patient. He was a senior figure in the
              accountancy world who had advised Governments; he was once the
              chairperson of a health trust. According to his cardiologist, he
              required cardiac surgery within seven days.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The earliest that the surgery could be
              performed in Northern Ireland, even if he were to pay for it, was
              in two and a half months’ time. The surgery was supposed to be
              performed within seven days. The cardiac surgeon advised him that
              he might have had to wait two years if he were a National Health
              Service patient. The problem was the total absence of the
              infrastructure that would have enabled cardiac surgeons, if they
              were available, to carry out the operation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close gave a litany of defaults in the
              orthopaedic service. Many of our major orthopaedic units have
              suspended all elective operations for hip replacements for the
              elderly and other remedial surgery. There is no money for those.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion gives an estimated figure of
              £574,419,000, which is based, presumably, on 45% of what will be
              required for the full year. The cost of administering Government
              through the Assembly and the 10 Departments over the coming year
              will probably be in the region of £1·2 billion. Upwards of 10%
              of the entire block grant will be spent on administration — on
              the additional cost of 10 Departments, which are not designated as
              such on the basis of any economic approach or on grounds of
              efficiency or effectiveness. There are 10 Departments because a
              cobbled-together political arrangement required 10 Departments.
              The money will be spent not only on the additional cost of those
              Departments but on the additional costs of the Departments’
              liaising with each other, and on the organisation of a traumatised
              and wrecked Civil Service, whose staff have oscillated from old
              Departments to new Departments. There is a whole range of
              additional costs. It costs approximately £1·2 billion to run
              this place.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close mentioned bureaucracy and increased
              government. None of the quangos, which we were promised would go
              when the tier of Government represented by the Assembly was
              established, have gone. All we have done is multiply the
              bureaucracy, the furnishings, the deep-pile plush carpets and
              reserved spaces, and create a bureaucracy that is stifling the
              governance of the Province.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the 26 councils and umpteen
              quangos, we have the biggest quango of all — here — a quango
              that is going to absorb in the region of £45 million in the
              coming year. Not only is this Assembly a quango by its very
              existence, the number of Members it contains cannot conceivably be
              justified on the basis of any rational comparison with any of the
              other devolved institutions in the United Kingdom. It certainly
              cannot be justified when compared with Scotland, which has far
              greater powers and a wider range of tax-raising abilities than we
              have. The Scottish Parliament has 129 Members for 5·5 million
              people. In addition to our 26 local councils, we have 108 Members
              for 1·6 million people. Wales has 60 Members for 3 million
              people. So much of the misgovernment of Northern Ireland has
              emanated from basing decisions, not on what was best for the
              governance of Northern Ireland, but on what was the most suitable
              political playpen for the political classes and on how the
              greatest possible number could participate in it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we must not just look to the Health
              Service — there is also Mr Empey’s Department. Mr Empey is
              presiding over a financial empire that is in total decline. One
              need only read the brief for tomorrow’s debate on job losses in
              East Antrim to see what that Department is doing. It is estimated
              that there will be 4,000 job losses in that area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did the Department of Agriculture, for example,
              do a great deal to rescue the pork industry? It certainly
              minimised the effects of foot-and-mouth disease, aided by the fact
              that we are separated from the mainland by 21 miles of water.
              However, as Dr Paisley pointed out, what has it done to help the
              agriculture industry?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Province has perhaps the best grammar
              school system in the UK, with an enormous number of children from
              both communities in Northern Ireland going to our own
              distinguished universities and to some of the most distinguished
              universities on the mainland and abroad. That system is about to
              be butchered on the shrine of some form of misguided political
              correctness, some sort of equality issue that states that the
              world is equal. It will be butchered, not on the basis of equality
              of opportunity, which we would all endorse, but on the basis of
              reducing every opportunity to some form of equality pap that
              everyone can ingest.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we examine the Assembly’s function and
              what it was designed to do — namely, to provide good governance
              for all the people in Northern Ireland — and consider the money
              that has been provided and that is being used, not in relation to
              some aspiration to maintain the Union or any equal aspiration to
              create Irish unity, we find that it is failing miserably because
              the very basis of governance is directed to fulfilling the
              ambitions of the political class in this Disney theme park that
              passes for Government.</p>

              efficiency in schools, access to rheumatoid arthritis treatment,
              help for north Belfast and youth and community work. Does the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All those issues, while important and valuable
              in themselves, are absolutely peripheral and marginal to the
              essential governance of Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What are the main services that people in a
              modern society look to their Government to provide? Health, for
              one — the Health Service is a mess. That is acknowledged by
              everyone, whether Unionist, Nationalist or any other variety of
              politician. It is the worst mess in the United Kingdom. Our
              waiting lists are 50% longer than those in the rest of the UK,
              where waiting lists are already considered to be a disgrace.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are on the verge of wrecking a perfectly
              good education system. I am not talking about the abolition of the
              11-plus — I believe that that needs to be looked at.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not talking about preserving grammar
              schools just because that is where middle-class children are
              educated. I received such an education, and I was certainly not
              middle class, as were many others. Instead of fiddling about
              waging some sort of class war on education, whether we are in Sinn
              Féin, the Ulster Unionist Party, or any other party, we should be
              looking at how we can improve that part of our educational system
              that is not functioning as it should be, rather than taking a
              hatchet to that part which is good. That is not happening because
              political battles are being fought about other issues.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Value for money is very much the order of the
              day. Is the public getting value for money from this Assembly? The
              Assembly was supposed to provide more accessible, more sensitive,
              more effective, more accountable Government — it is doing none
              of those things. All the major services that the people expect a
              Government to provide have got far worse instead of better under
              devolved Government. Now this is not necessarily an attack on
              devolved Government as an abstract philosophy; it is an attack
              upon devolved Government as practised in this Assembly, and based
              upon a system which is not democratic at all. <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, look at the cost of the Office of
              the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister for last year,
              which was £35·5 million, give or take a few thousand — only
              marginally less than the cost of running the entire Assembly. What
              does the office administer, and what does it do? Money is being
              wasted on maladministration here. I see an hon Member smiling.
              Perhaps he would not be smiling if he was one of the 136 elderly
              folk who cannot get a community care package because of
              maladministration. Bed blocking costs £1,500 to £2,000 a time,
              but if a fair sum was paid to private nursing care, the cost could
              be a third of that price — but that is quango control.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly has done absolutely nothing to
              attack the cost of bureaucracy in administration and so reform its
              finances. We had a nicely delivered speech from the Minister of
              Finance and Personnel, but was it his speech, or was it the speech
              of the army of bureaucrats that are preparing everything? This is
              not devolved Government — this place is a bureaucrats’
              paradise. Nothing in that speech addressed the sort of problems
              that Mr Close mentioned. We need fundamental reform of the
              financial system and better use of the funds available to us. I am
              not an admirer of devolution — certainly not in the form of this
              Assembly. However, we have devolution, and I am a democrat.
              Regardless of party, we should look very carefully at how
              devolution, as practised in Northern Ireland, is serving the
              people. There is little in these Estimates to indicate that it is
              doing that efficiently.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hesitate to follow Bob McCartney, but much of
              what he said about how we are delivering, or trying to deliver and
              perhaps not succeeding, is correct. However, I want to take up his
              last point about a public administration review. In January 1999,
              we were told that this public review would be undertaken. Three
              years later there is not one quango fewer, not one trust fewer and
              not one board fewer.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No Department can plan anything until the
              matter of public administration has been resolved. The Department
              of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the Department of
              Education cannot be blamed for all the ills. However, they do get
              the blame; and the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public
              Safety, in particular, is blamed for the waiting lists, the lack
              of orthopaedic surgery and the lack of cardiac surgery.</p>

              merely saying that until the review of public administration has
              been sorted out, every Department will be hampered in how it
              advances its particular agenda. That is all I was saying.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is right when he says that we are
              overburdened in comparison to Scotland or Wales. However, we must
              take into account the special circumstances and the fact that this
              Assembly came into being to resolve a political question rather
              than an economic or a social one — although we are attempting to
              address those along the way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the core of this — and this was touched on

              approach at the centre to resolve pressing social, economic,
              health, education and housing problems. The fact that a public
              administration review has been taking place since January 1999
              without having advanced one iota indicates the lack of collective
              responsibility for resolving these matters.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Certainly, there may be difficulties with one
              party, which is prepared and happy to live off the largesse of the
              Good Friday Agreement without bearing the responsibilities that
              derive from the agreement, a party whose members put their fingers
              and thumbs into the political pie of the Good Friday Agreement and
              pull out the political plums without bearing their share of
              collective responsibility.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the last big debate about health in this
              Chamber, it was said over and over again that health was being
              starved of money. Seamus Close said that Mark Durkan acknowledged
              that health was the priority in the Programme for Government when
              he introduced his Budget. Yet health still remains to be
              prioritised for funding. During the Budget debate Mark Durkan said
              that what he was giving to health would allow the health programme
              merely not to stand still. Bob McCartney and other Members have
              made it clear that it must do more than not stand still. If we
              care, if our function is to meet the social needs of the people
              whom we are elected to serve, health must be at the very centre of
              how we deliver our responsibilities. If the Executive cannot get
              their act together on their collective responsibility to health,
              then how can they get their act together in dealing with other
              responsibilities?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Confederation for Health
              and Social Services (NICON), which is at the core of the Health
              Service, has already indicated that the Health Service requires an
              extra £100 million a year, or £1 billion over 10 years. That sum
              is necessary to allow the Department of Health, Social Services
              and Public Safety to plan a strategy that can deliver at the point
              of need and that can address the serious shortcomings in all the
              disciplines in the medical services, such as orthopaedics, cardiac
              surgery and cancer in all its manifestations. The Health Service
              is badly behind in its infrastructure and is unable to address
              long waiting lists and delays in dealing with cancer. We have had

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, the long-term aspect has not been
              addressed. As a priority in the Programme for Government, the
              Executive undertook to address the long-term ability to deal with
              the shortcomings in the Health Service. If any Minister goes to
              the Executive to plead for their particular area of
              responsibility, they will get only what they ask for. There needs
              to be a commitment at the centre of Government, not just one
              Department, to this area that affects everyone; it affects the
              social, economic and health well-being of the community. There
              should be a collective responsibility in addressing that issue and
              the obvious shortcomings in that particular Department. That has

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In their Programme for Government, the

              that has not been addressed. If it had been seriously addressed,
              then we would not have the ‘Belfast Telegraph’ and all health
              disciplines continually complaining about a lack of funding. The
              sad fact is that the people at the coalface, those who are most
              anxious to see an end to waiting lists in whatever discipline, are
              those who are suffering the most.</p>

              Minister. It is not the responsibility of one Minister. The
              Executive are responsible for addressing health issues and the way
              in which they are failing the Health Service. I will not make a
              plea on behalf of the Minister of Health, Social Services and

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a member of the Committee for Agriculture

              deal with brucellosis, tuberculosis and other diseases — the
              figures are shocking. What could we do with that money if we had
              it today? Veterinary scientists who know as much about the matter
              as some of our departmental specialists have asked me whether the
              vaccination of all farm animals has been considered. All two- or
              three-day-old cattle must be vaccinated against various diseases.
              The need to vaccinate animals becomes clearer every day, but
              insufficient thought has been given to the matter. The millions of
              pounds that are spent at the moment are a drain of resources from

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened to the questions to the Minister of
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety today, and I asked her
              an important question. I also attended an event at the Long
              Gallery today during which cancer and the work of Macmillan Cancer
              Relief were discussed. I do not want to compare the two
              discussions. The number of doctors per capita in Northern Ireland
              by comparison to the equivalent figures for other countries does
              not bear thinking about. It almost seems as if people here do not
              care.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An environmental point that was not made is
              that if nothing is done about the pollution of this country we
              will gradually poison ourselves. It used to be possible to use
              water from a well, but that is no longer the case, because
              everything is at risk of pollution.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Departments get their act
              together. As a member of the Agriculture Committee, I would have
              liked to have had the opportunity to propose how much money is
              needed for specific purposes. Although I do not miss many
              meetings, I did not have the opportunity to make my case. In
              December 2000 we put forward a case for an early retirement scheme
              and long-term low-interest loans for the agriculture sector. Not
              enough serious thought has been put into those issues. However,
              bearing in mind what is happening in various sectors, a time will
              come when the people who come after us will say that we had our
              opportunity and did not take it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close and Ms Morrice talked about the number
              of accidents on our roads. What have we been doing to counteract
              that? What cost do you put on a life? People have talked about how
              much it costs to run the Assembly. What is the cost of saving one
              life, five lives, or ten lives? It is bound to bear fruit
              eventually. There are many things that the Assembly could be
              taking a greater interest in.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Look at the size of the budget we have to
              discuss — and see how few Members are sitting in the House
              today. Those who are not here should be ashamed of themselves. I
              do not know where they are. Ministers — with their big
              Departments — should be here today to fight their corner. They
              should show more interest. They need not leave it to the
              Back-Benchers to do it for them. That will not happen. I will not
              take the blame for people who should be making more of an effort
              to debate the matters that come before us.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have talked about the many issues that face
              this country at present. Mr John Kelly pointed to the three main
              questions — health, standards of living and food protection. We
              can do something about those matters. With all due respect to the
              Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and her
              Department, it would not matter who held that post. The Minister
              and the Department must address the crisis. There is a large
              backlog — and we have had a mild winter. I dread to think what
              might have happened in our hospitals had the winter been a rough
              one.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the big hospitals — Craigavon Area
              Hospital — is in my constituency. Problems are emerging there
              week in, week out. If that hospital had the facilities and the
              nursing manpower, it could do something about the existing
              problems. The nurses there are heavily overworked, and the
              hospital does not have the facilities to cope with the number of
              patients coming through its doors. More money should be put into
              recruiting young doctors, because there is a scarcity of them.
              Doctors will not come into the Health Service unless they are
              going to be able to provide proper care and attention. When you
              consider the challenges they face and the hours they have to work
              you cannot blame them for not going down the Health Service route.
              Dr Adamson, who is sitting behind me, is a very experienced
              doctor, and I am sure he will bear out what I am saying.</p>

              more into their confidence and allow them to have a greater input
              into determining budgets. We must be realistic: if we are not,
              then the work of the last three or four years will have been in

              Ireland Audit Office spring Supplementary Estimates for 2001-02.
              The Audit Committee has statutory responsibility for agreeing and
              presenting the Audit Office Estimate, and as Chairperson, I am
              speaking in support of its bid for a Supplementary Estimate of
              £49,000. That amount was included in its original submission to
              the Audit Committee for its 2001-02 funding. However, for
              technical reasons, it was not possible for the money to be
              included in the Main Estimates, and it was agreed with the
              Department of Finance and Personnel that it should be provided by
              a Supplementary Estimate. The Audit Committee has agreed the
              amount requested in the Supplementary Estimate, and I commend it
              for the approval of the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second matter concerns the Northern Ireland
              Audit Office Vote on Account for 2002-03. The amounts requested
              for the Vote on Account are £2,096,000 in cash and £2,320,000 in
              resources. The Audit Committee will soon meet with the Comptroller
              and Auditor General to discuss his office’s spending plans for
              2002-03. In the meantime, I am satisfied that the amounts have
              been calculated using the standard formulae, and I commend them to

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am just regulating the technicalities. The
              budget of approximately £4·5 million is a huge sum of money that
              must be spent in the way in which it was intended. There must be
              no flaws in the procurement procedures, and it must be clearly
              shown that the public gets excellent value for money. The task of
              verifying that money is properly spent falls to the Northern
              Ireland Audit Office under the control of the Comptroller and
              Auditor General.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to place on record my total confidence
              in the Audit Office and its staff. The reports that the office has
              produced have enabled the Public Accounts Committee to scrutinise
              public spending in a way that was not possible under direct rule.
              The Public Accounts Committee has tackled its job without fear or
              favour, and it deserves the support of the entire Assembly. I am
              sorry that it does not always receive that support. The reports
              are, without exception, balanced and fair. I have left it to
              others to express concerns about health, education, agriculture
              and other issues that have been discussed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to use my limited time to highlight the
              absolute need to ensure that all Government Departments and
              non-departmental Government bodies play their part in rebuilding
              this economy that has been so damaged under direct rule. During
              that time bad practices crept in, accountability was less than
              acceptable, and on some occasions a degree of arrogance evolved
              when money and, indeed, people were being dealt with. Reports
              prepared by the Audit Office are agreed and signed off by the
              accounting officer responsible for the Department to which the
              report relates. There is a genuine wish that reports are not
              delayed before they are signed off. It is fundamental that the
              reports are published quickly, so that the Public Accounts
              Committee has the opportunity to scrutinise them with the
              Comptroller and Auditor General before arranging a public hearing
              at which the relevant Department’s accounting officer has an
              opportunity to answer questions. That is fundamental to change for
              the better.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that I have the full support of the
              Assembly when I say that Members will take it seriously if they
              discover that reports are held up unnecessarily. If that were to
              become widespread, it would cause enormous damage to the work of
              the Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee. The problem is
              not widespread by any means, but there is concern that a report
              relating to the Northern Ireland Tourist Board has not been signed
              off in order that it could be published this week. As I have said,
              that concerns me and, no doubt, others.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister recently undertook to ensure, as
              far as is practical, that reports are not unduly held up. I draw
              that fact to the Assembly’s attention in the belief that the
              current delay will be brief.</p>

              applied to the 16 poorest councils. That would have been a major
              injustice that would have directly contradicted the Executive’s
              targeting social need policy. It is interesting to note that the
              proposal to cut district council resources arose because of
              inescapable new pressures — some £2 million — on EU
              international obligations. My Committee examined the nature of
              those new pressures and fully supported the priority that the

              shall return to that subject later.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall explain to the House what my Committee
              did to scrutinise the Department of the Environment’s budget
              proposals for 2002-03. We obtained the full breakdown of the
              Department’s discretionary expenditure of £14·6 million,
              having set aside inescapable expenditure such as salaries, EU
              obligations, local government derating and the resources grant. We
              questioned senior officials to justify that expenditure, having
              categorised it by priority — high, medium and low — and to
              explain the consequences of not meeting each item of expenditure.
              We scrutinised the Department’s potential asset sales, the scope
              to increase the use of receipts to fund baseline expenditure and
              the potential to fast-track EU compliance expenditure for 2002-03
              to utilise moneys being surrendered in this financial year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I noticed that some Members in the House feel
              that their Committees have not been able to get enough information
              from Ministers or from Departments. If they accept such a
              situation, that says more about them than about the Departments,
              as I assure the House that when my Committee desires to have
              information, we are not put off easily.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee concluded that there was little
              scope or flexibility in the Department’s budget to make savings
              or switch resources. It is essential to protect the sizeable
              budget element, to implement EU obligations, and to maintain and
              build on much needed services, such as planning services, where
              there is a clear increase in demand. In the light of the Committee’s
              conclusion, and the reality of emerging EU international
              obligation budget pressures, I ask the new Minister of Finance and
              Personnel, along with his Colleague the Minister of the
              Environment, to consider ring-fencing the provision for local
              government services and the EU international obligation provision
              within the Department of the Environment’s budget.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">District councils are at the forefront of many
              important initiatives under way to protect our environment that
              link directly to EU Directives. For example, waste management
              plans and the local air quality schemes are important issues.
              Therefore, to ring-fence the local government budget would provide
              the financial stability to allow councils to implement quickly
              that essential work, which would benefit all the people of
              Northern Ireland. My Committee has taken a particular interest in
              recent months in getting the three regional waste management plans
              funded and operational.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We questioned representatives from the three
              groups and also departmental officials on two separate occasions
              in an endeavour to find ways to hasten their work and to help them
              to meet their EU obligations. Members of the Committee welcomed
              the long-awaited launch of the plans last week, and I assure the
              House that my Committee will continue its monitoring and will do
              whatever is necessary to ensure that those plans are delivered
              quickly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee was alarmed to learn that £1
              million of the Department’s budget for waste management was
              surrendered in October 2001. Having pressed the Department of the
              Environment and the Department of Finance and Personnel, the
              Committee has received written assurances that any shortfall in
              the waste management budget for 2002-03 will be favourably treated
              in in-year bids, bearing in mind that the work is essential to
              meet EU obligations. The Committee was reminded of the importance
              of that work last week, when it was advised that failure to meet
              the EU Directive on waste management could incur United Kingdom
              fines of £400,000 a day at the end of the year. The Northern
              Ireland Executive Budget would contribute directly to such fines
              if Northern Ireland failed to implement the Directive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee recognises the strong case for
              increasing expenditure in some other Departments but makes the
              point that a sizeable increase in the £111 million allocated to
              the Department of the Environment’s baseline would be marginal
              in the Northern Ireland block of over £6 billion. That increase
              would, however, have a significant impact on the protection of the
              environment — a Cinderella during direct rule. The Assembly
              should consider allocating proper funding to secure and sustain
              Northern Ireland’s primary asset before it is too late.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall remove the hat of the Chairperson of
              the Committee for the Environment and speak on other issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr John Kelly stated that we were overburdened
              and that additional resources were necessary and quick action was
              needed on the public administration review. Coming from Sinn Féin
              those are interesting remarks. It was to please Sinn Féin party
              sponsors that the Assembly was overburdened, in relation to the
              size of Northern Ireland, with 108 elected Members. It was to
              placate Sinn Féin’s greed that 10 Departments were formed
              instead of six. That was to allow Sinn Féin to get its greedy
              hands on two ministries. It was also to placate the idealism of
              so-called Sinn Féin that over £50 million is being spent on
              cross-border bodies. All of this was at the insistence of Sinn
              Féin and its fellow travellers. It is rather rich, to say the
              least, for Sinn Féin to lecture the Assembly about the need for
              allocating money to Departments for which it has responsibility.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that people’s health is a
              priority, and the House has recognised that in allocating
              resources in the past, and I trust that it will do so in the
              future. I have said it before, and I shall say it again — it is
              not simply the allocation of resources that makes an effective
              Department. One of the major catastrophes of the Department of
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety is not just lack of
              funding in the past but that the Department is without leadership.
              The ship is rudderless because the Minister is totally
              ineffective, without vision or effort.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a crisis in the Health Service. Mr
              Close mentioned the British Medical Association. Much of the
              Department’s work has been dictated by various Royal College
              instructions and diktats, rather than by a consideration of the
              whole picture and the needs of acute services throughout the
              community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, the elderly feel forsaken. We had
              several debates on that issue in the Chamber. We allocated money
              for nursing care for the elderly in nursing homes. However, we
              have been told that the elderly will continue to be drained of
              their savings until October. It will be another eight to ten
              months before the will of the Assembly will be implemented.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was the Assembly’s will that the
              Department should take the responsibility for nursing costs. The
              Department will not take that responsibility immediately. The
              Minister tells us that the elderly will have to wait until
              October. They will have to pay for their own care, and their
              resources will be drained away while the Assembly’s resolution
              that the elderly should be relieved of that financial burden is
              set aside until October.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have heard the fanciful statements about who
              is to blame. New Labour blames the Conservatives for everything.
              Certainly, there are problems for which the Conservatives must
              carry the blame. However, we have had direct rule under the
              Conservatives and under Labour. The lack of resources is the
              responsibility of the Labour Government as well as of the former
              Conservative Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently the ‘Belfast Telegraph’ published
              an article showing that six years ago, under direct Conservative
              rule, there were 22,000 nurses in Northern Ireland. However, under
              the Assembly and the Minister there are 16,000 nurses. Surely
              there is something wrong. It cannot be blamed on the then
              Conservative Government, because the figure of 22,000 refers to
              the period when the Conservatives left office. The lower figure
              refers to the period under the new Labour Administration and then
              the Assembly. If the figures are correct — and they have been in
              the public arena — the Department of Health ought to hang its
              head in shame.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is why our nurses are overworked and why
              many of them are at the end of their personal resources and
              suffering health breakdowns. That decline did not happen under the
              Conservative Government, behind which the Minister seems to hide,
              but under her stewardship. The bottom line is that the Minister is
              not capable of doing the job.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we want more resources, we should look at
              the 10 Departments, the constant stream of finance that goes to
              the cross-border bodies, and the number of elected representatives
              in this Chamber. There are quangos and a public administration
              review that does not seem to get off the ground. Many people
              heralded that the Assembly would grasp the quangos and the public
              administration by the neck and arrest the decline in our public
              services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That has not been the reality. We have gone in
              the opposite direction. The stream of finance to the quangos flows
              on; money flows into more quangos and cross- border bodies, which
              are not answerable to this Chamber of elected representatives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The increase in finances being pumped into the
              Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister must be
              examined. Resources must be scrutinised carefully in order to
              determine the purpose for which they are being used.</p>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us consider the roads. I appreciate that
              the Minister is right in relation to finances for particular
              schemes. However, the Minister cannot evade his responsibility in
              relation to the infrastructure. Unless money is allocated to the
              Department for Regional Development, the need to enhance the
              infrastructure throughout the Province cannot become a reality.
              Members agree that transport — roads and rail — has in the
              past been a disaster with regard to finances. Transport was put on
              the back-burner, as were many other things. However, that is no
              excuse for the Assembly not providing for, or meeting, the
              challenge.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I mentioned the Magherafelt bypass. The bypass
              would not only enhance the economic future of my own district of
              Magherafelt but also that of Cookstown, which is where all traffic
              must go in order to reach the seaports and airports. The constant
              blockages and the time wasted sitting in traffic in Magherafelt
              are detrimental to the economic development of the Cookstown
              district as well as Magherafelt. Adequate finances must be made
              available, and that is the responsibility of the Minister of
              Finance and Personnel.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farming has been mentioned already. I reiterate
              the demand for a retirement scheme that will allow farmers to
              retire with dignity. Many of the problems facing that industry,
              more so than any other, have not come about as a result of the
              irresponsibility or neglect of the farming community in Northern
              Ireland, which has produced primary goods and given us its best.
              Many of the challenges that have arisen, such as BSE and other
              problems in the pig and sheep sectors, have been out of the
              control of farmers. Farmers looked to the Department of
              Agriculture and Rural Development for guidance. They were given
              guidance, to which they adhered. Unfortunately, farmers paid the
              price for listening to that advice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A retirement scheme would allow farmers to
              retire with dignity and honour. However, there must be a young
              entrants scheme so that the young people of the Province’s rural
              community can see a future and a vision for farming. If Northern
              Ireland’s farmers do not provide food, farmers in some other
              part of the EU will do so instead. Why should our farmers have
              their backs to the wall because of negativity in the Department of
              Agriculture and Rural Development and in the Administration?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farmers are being assisted elsewhere. When
              Northern Ireland’s pig farmers had their backs to the wall, the
              Department was unwilling to help them. We were told that EU
              regulations would not allow that. France is in the EU, and it was
              one of the guiding fathers of those regulations, yet the French
              Government were able to help their farmers. The French Government
              provided resources for their farmers and bailed them out when
              their backs were against the wall. Ministers told me that EU rules
              could not be broken. Of course, France and the Irish Republic can
              break the rules, but Northern Ireland cannot. In the end, those
              farmers who were supported by their Government managed to stay in
              the field.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They continued and, in actual fact, their
              financial position has been enhanced. It is sad to say that our
              Government let many farmers go to the wall. It is also sad to say
              that many of the banks and finance houses in this country that
              goaded the farmers into debt turned on them when their backs were
              against the wall and looked for their pound of flesh, rather than
              assisting them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to speak on a subject as an elected
              representative for my constituency. It is very difficult to get
              through even as many as eight questions in Question Time,
              especially questions on health. A person speaks in gibberish and
              then in English, and that is given as an excuse for not answering
              questions. Fewer questions are answered because it takes double
              the time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Education, in reply to a
              question, talked much today about our children being equal. I
              invite any Member of the Assembly to visit schools in Magherafelt
              and see if our children are equal. There is a primary school and a
              secondary school in Magherafelt in the state, or controlled,
              sector that are in deplorable conditions. In the maintained
              sector, millions of pounds have been spent in St Mary’s.
              Millions of pounds have also been spent, and are currently being
              spent, in St Pius’s. In the person’s own constituency,
              however, Magherafelt High School is in a deplorable condition.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Children are not equal. Protestant children in
              that constituency are being discriminated against. We are
              compiling the figures, because they will speak for themselves.
              When equality of treatment for all schoolchildren is paraded as a
              supposed ideal, I, as a public representative, must ensure that
              equality of treatment for all schoolchildren — in the
              controlled, maintained and independent sectors — will be a
              reality and that discrimination against the state or controlled
              sector will be brought to an end.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All is not well in education — far from it.
              Even in this debate I trust that, as an elected representative, I
              have the opportunity of blowing the trumpet with a very certain
              sound to ensure that we have action rather than pious words.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We know, as the wider public knows, that the
              resources from the Treasury are not sufficient to meet the needs
              of this society. One of the few ways of raising funds for health,
              education, roads and all other services that have been mentioned
              today that are needed by people in our constituencies is through
              the rates. Although no one in the House likes to raise the issue
              of rates, realistically we must depend on rates to raise much
              needed revenue. It is, of course, essential to develop innovative
              means of funding and efficiency so that we can reduce our
              dependence upon rates.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement. I am very
              aware of the pressures faced by the Executive in meeting demands
              with limited resources. As a member of the Committee for Finance
              and Personnel, I am heartened by the statement. It is clear that
              the new Minister is as committed to making those funds go a long
              way as his predecessor was. It is important that we support and
              approve the actions of the Minister of Finance and Personnel. His
              job is a difficult and complex one, and he is doing it fairly and
              professionally. However, it is insufficient just to offer
              congratulations from these Benches.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Members, and particularly those in the
              Executive and the Committees, must work ceaselessly in pursuit of
              the goals of everyone in our community. We must be watchful of
              expenditures that do not meet existing priorities. We must
              continually question the use of resources in every Department and
              ask if such use represents value for money. The pressures on the
              Health Service have been discussed today and have been recognised
              by the Minister and the Executive. In the 2001 Budget, the whole
              allocation of £27·8 million for Northern Ireland announced in
              the pre-Budget statement went on health, together with an
              immediate cash injection of £8 million for this year. In total
              the amount allocated to health for the next year represents an
              increase of 9·7% on the current year’s provision. That must be
              welcomed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been said before that the Health Service
              needs resources, but the House must be assured that funds are
              being spent as efficiently and effectively as possible. I,
              therefore, welcome the needs and effectiveness evaluations that
              have been undertaken in several Departments. Will the Minister
              tell us when those reviews will be completed?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that the reviews of the
              Executive programme funds were under way. I agree with the concept
              of those funds; they are a sign that the new Administration is
              committed to using the funds in an innovative way that truly
              supports cross-departmental actions. In reviewing the Executive
              programme funds, I ask the Minister to ensure that the concept
              remains intact. What is the timetable for the completion of that
              review?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate that the Barnett formula can be
              misunderstood. It is not simply a case of seeking a review of the
              formula, with the subsequent assumption that we will receive a
              larger share of the block grant. Members should take into account
              the risk involved in pressing for a re-examination of the Barnett
              formula — it could end up with a negative result. I ask the
              Minister to address the issue in his summing-up and to outline how
              the Executive intend to take it forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the changes brought about by the
              monitoring process and budgets, which we decided for ourselves.
              Local decision-making is beginning to take effect, and we can set
              our own priorities. Again, everyone should welcome that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I share some of the frustrations expressed
              about the process and timing of the Supplementary Estimates. The
              issues are difficult, and Members want to understand them fully
              and contribute to the process. Perhaps the Minister will consider
              providing a summary of the decisions or take steps to assist us in
              fully buying into the budgetary process.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the Supply resolution, and ask the
              House to do the same, and more, to build a resource base for the
              future.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this point much of what had to be said about
              the general issues surrounding the allocation of resources has
              been said. I do not want to make a plea for special cases in areas
              in which I am particularly interested or which would benefit the
              constituency and the groupings that I represent. That plea ought
              to be made, but I will look first at the general concept of the
              debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members spoke about the opportunity to
              scrutinise. Ms Lewsley said that we must work ceaselessly and be
              watchful of expenditure that does not meet priorities. Mr Savage
              wanted a bigger input into determining the Budget. I listened to
              special cases for health, for cutting waiting lists, for dealing
              with the environment, farming issues and all the other areas of
              disadvantage. I find it difficult to believe that Members want to
              have a bigger input into the Budget but also want to examine
              matters that should not be priorities. What priorities do they
              have in their minds?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How enslaved are they to their party Whips?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it a bigger priority to spend over £50
              million on the political correctness of cross-border bodies than
              it is to spend the money on hospitals so that people who are
              hobbling about in pain can have hip replacements? Is it a bigger
              priority to give the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
              First Minister a budget equivalent to that required to run the
              Assembly? The Programme for Government states that its budget
              should be used to</p>

              his previous professional expertise that there is a strong
              argument that the significant demand for healthcare is practically
              infinite in the United Kingdom because it is provided free at the
              point of use. Can he help the House by outlining how many extra
              millions are necessary for healthcare? All the £50 million from
              the North/South bodies could be put into the health system, only
              to find that it makes little difference.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that the Member raised that point,
              because I intend to speak about resources. We could, perhaps, pump
              another £50 million into the Health Service and find that it is
              still not enough. However, even if that were the case, I should
              prefer to see that money put into services that affect the lives
              of constituents than see it go to politically correct institutions
              that are in place only to satisfy the demands of Sinn Féin and
              the SDLP.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question of whether the Assembly has made
              the Administration accountable has not been asked. Either that or
              Members really do have a skewed sense of what is important. My
              Colleague Dr McCrea reminded us that we were told that there would
              be an assault on quangos. Quangos, to use his words, would be
              &quot;grasped by the neck&quot;. They have been grasped by the
              neck — they have been hugged.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The two main parties in the Assembly have
              definitely hugged them. They could not wait to set quangos up and
              put some of their prime members on them. They did not want to do
              away with quangos; they wanted to institute more of them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Has the Assembly addressed the way in which the
              costs of administration have burgeoned? It has not.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the reasons for that is that the
              Assembly’s pro-agreement parties have put in place layers of
              administration to suit their own political demands. Some are too
              afraid to upset the others and are therefore whipped into backing
              certain views. Their words in the House show that they are not
              happy that money should be spent in such a way. However, their
              votes in the Lobbies belie their words, because they vote for the
              very things that they say they oppose. This should be a
              significant debate — it should be a debate about priorities and
              resources. At the end of the debate, Members should vote according
              to how they have spoken. That will not happen, because they will
              find someone else to blame. Mr John Kelly epitomises that
              approach.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety has received a big increase in resources, as Dr
              Birnie mentioned. Nevertheless, we are told that there is still a
              crisis. They used to be able to blame the Brits. There are still
              Members who blame direct rule, even though direct rule ended four
              years ago, just as the Labour Party still blames the
              Conservatives. Mr John Kelly has refined that approach; he no
              longer blames the Minister responsible, but the Executive. Someone
              else is always to blame. He should consider how the Minister of
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety has used resources. She
              seems more interested in employing linguists to do her
              interpretations than she is in employing doctors and nurses to do
              what patients need; yet we still hear criticism and people crying
              and moaning that they need more resources.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Certain areas must be addressed. I shall not
              say a great deal about this matter — I said that I would not
              make pleas for special cases. However, we must consider housing
              provision. I say that because I am on the Social Development
              Committee and have a special interest in that matter. It is wrong
              to think that we can rejuvenate run-down areas of Northern Ireland
              if we do not put money into urban regeneration, including housing.
              It is fair to ask for additional resources. I have not been
              pleading many special cases. On occasions, I have made pleas for
              more money for the roads network or for schools — I recently
              tabled a motion on the need for additional capital for school
              buildings. However, it is not enough continually to hold out our
              hands to the Exchequer and say that the Barnett formula must be
              improved or changed. I would dread the Exchequer’s doing that.</p>

              saying one thing in the Chamber and voting for another in the
              Lobbies. Does he recall that when an attempt was made to raise
              additional capital by raising the regional rate he and his
              Colleagues walked through the &quot;Noes&quot; Lobby?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not enough to dip our hands into the
              pockets of people who struggle from day to day to pay their bills
              and to keep their businesses going. It is not enough to pick money
              out of the wallets of people who are living just above the
              threshold of benefit support and say that we expect them to pay
              the bill for our folly. I have already outlined in the Assembly
              ways in which we could change the spending priorities that would
              not require us to put small businesses and vulnerable people on
              low or medium incomes in greater difficulty. The Member should not
              say that I simply walked through the &quot;Noes&quot; Lobby and
              left the problem to the Minister of Finance and Personnel.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have suggested ways. Of course, the easy way
              out is to simply go along with the present pattern of expenditure
              and say, &quot;Let the poor ratepayer pay for it&quot;. However,
              that is not an answer, and, at the end of the day, that will cause
              great difficulty.</p>

              better to be honourable and tell people that you are taxing them
              — then at least they will know whether to support you.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you for that useful intervention.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now turn to some of the points that Dr Birnie
              made. We must look for innovative ways of obtaining the additional
              resources needed to deliver public services. Perhaps the Assembly
              should be a little more innovative and should examine how current
              ways of delivering services could be changed to bring in
              additional finance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been recent discussion about raising
              money through bonds to bring in additional revenue to deal with
              some of the capital and service requirements in Northern Ireland.
              That also requires a radical examination of how those services are
              delivered and whether they are delivered solely through the public
              sector. I have no problem with that. I believe that many people in
              Northern Ireland do not care whether their services are directed
              solely by a public body or whether they are delivered by a body at
              arm’s length from the public sector, which is run on a
              non-profit-making basis and which can draw down extra resources,
              provided — and this is the important thing — that they get a
              decent service. People are interested in the outcome; not where
              the input comes from. There is a range of services that we could
              deal with in that way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have heard opposition in the Assembly to PFI
              because it puts money in the hands of private contractors. I have
              no great difficulty with PFI schemes and, indeed, if more capital
              projects can be delivered in that way, I am quite happy to
              consider it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly must look beyond dipping its hands
              into the pockets of the taxpayers, many of whom cannot afford it,
              and holding out a begging bowl to Westminster. If it can be proved
              through needs assessment that we are entitled to more money then
              we should be arguing the case. However, we cannot always rely on
              saying &quot;We deserve this&quot;, whether justified or not.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fundamental issues of the Assembly have
              been addressed in the debate: whether the Assembly has a mechanism
              which holds the Executive accountable; whether Members are so
              constrained by their party Whips that they do not vote in the way
              that they speak, and whether we are prepared to address the
              radical issue of how we obtain additional resources beyond the two
              main ways that we addressed the issue in the past, in order to
              deliver some of the services that are much needed.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate has been used to make general and
              particular points relevant to the Budget. Many Members have used
              it for wider purposes, rehearsing well-worn arguments on the
              nature of our political institutions and their origin — but that
              is the nature of such debates. In my response, I shall attempt to
              focus on those matters that directly pertain to issues raised in
              my introductory remarks.</p>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s debate provides a further valuable
              opportunity to hear and consider Members’ concerns about our
              spending plans. This is only the second occasion on which we have
              presented Supplementary Estimates to the Assembly. In many areas,
              our budgetary process is in the early stages of development and is
              still evolving. Undoubtedly, it will evolve taking note of the
              recommendations and points made by Members in their contributions.
              I am no guardian of the kind of status quo that some allege we
              have, and I share with Members the desire and the conviction that
              ran through many of the contributions — ensuring that the
              Government are efficient and effective in meeting the needs of all
              our people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The spring Supplementary Estimates draw
              together the spending decisions made by the Executive during the
              year. Some Members seem to be approaching these Supply resolutions
              as if they were being presented for their consideration for the
              very first time. Of course, that is not the case. We have been
              through these issues in statements on the monitoring rounds and in
              the considerable period allocated to the consideration of the
              Budget before it was adopted before Christmas. That period allowed
              all Members, both in Plenary and in Committee, considerable
              scrutiny and consideration of the priorities in today’s Supply
              resolutions. I remind Members that these same issues have been
              before them for consideration in much the same terms as they are
              being presented today. Members should not speak as if this were
              the first time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several points and questions were raised during
              the debate, and I shall cover as many as I can now. Other, more
              detailed, questions, such as those posed by Ms Morrice, will
              require a more considered response later. Mr Molloy, Mr Close and
              others again raised concerns that people have not had enough time
              to consider the Supplementary Estimates; I have already dealt with
              that. I want to reaffirm what Mr Close said: we continue to look
              for improvements in scrutinising the spending allocations and the
              Estimates. I want to address the point fairly and frankly. There
              will never be much more time for Committee and Assembly scrutiny
              at this stage of the cycle, which falls tightly between decisions
              on December monitoring and the need for completing the approved
              process before the end of the year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I reiterate that there is much more
              time to examine the issues, at several stages. First, the most
              important stage in each cycle is the autumn, when the Assembly can
              consider the issues that arise between the draft Budget and the
              revised Budget. Secondly, there is a considerable period between
              now and the debate on the Main Estimates in June. The motion
              covers an amount on account for 2002-03; the Main Estimates will
              simply complete that process in more detail.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Committees can, and should, take up issues
              relating to the Estimates for 2002-03 between now and the debates
              about them in June. There is a considerable amount of time left,
              therefore I do not accept the complaint of some Members that there
              is not always sufficient time to scrutinise the matters fully. I
              recognise that the timescale in this part of the cycle is tight,
              but we are revisiting issues in respect of which there has been
              much opportunity for debate and scrutiny.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, and most importantly, we are about to
              begin an important spending review. In looking to the future,
              Committees and the Assembly can now begin to scrutinise and
              analyse spending plans for 2003-04. Seamus Close pointed out that
              the Estimates were prepared on a resource basis, as were the Main
              Estimates last June, and cover allocations previously announced
              after the June, September and December monitoring rounds, all of
              which were the subject of detailed statements to the Assembly. The
              Estimates also cover the second round of allocations from the
              Executive programme funds, which were the subject of a statement
              to the House on 3 December.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Information on all the significant issues that
              were addressed today has been available to the Committees. The
              Committees could have pursued any matter with their Departments
              through the available channels on the basis of information that
              was provided in the context of earlier monitoring decisions and
              Budget proposals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was impressed by the Chairperson of the
              Committee for the Environment’s point that that Committee had
              set about prioritising and, in consultation with the Department,
              addressing the priorities that had been set by the Department and
              itself. He said that there should be no reason why other
              Committees might not adopt a similar approach and that it should
              not be difficult to obtain the level of access to departmental
              officials that the Environment Committee had to its Department. I
              believe that it is. Therefore, we should examine carefully how
              Committees contribute to the prioritisation and scrutiny process,
              both in retrospect and in prospect.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a great deal of sympathy with many of
              the views that were expressed, particularly the need to allow more
              time for consideration of the issues and to provide more
              user-friendly documentation. We will re-examine the issue and
              consider what improvements we could make. I will continue to take
              on board the Finance and Personnel Committee’s views in that
              regard. I trust that the Committee will acknowledge that in my
              short period in office I have lost no time in making myself
              available to it when my presence was requested. I have also made
              myself available to the Committee Chairperson and Deputy
              Chairperson.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I again emphasise that Committees are free to
              ask questions at any stage of the processes that are now being
              concluded in these Estimates. That applies equally to discussions
              about the annual Budget and each monitoring round. Committee
              members do not need a signal from the Minister of Finance and
              Personnel that they may begin their scrutiny.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several members have reasonably pointed out the
              sheer complexity and comparison of the material in front of us. I
              share the sense that there are more questions than answers, and
              that answers are sometimes hard to find. The details in the
              Estimates are necessary to fulfil the legislative obligations on
              Departments and on the Department of Finance and Personnel, which
              mirrors practice elsewhere. I wonder what Members’ reactions
              would be if we were to provide less information. I imagine that
              the point would rightly be made that we were concealing details
              that Members were entitled to have access to as regards how we
              spend the finances available to us. So, regrettably there is a
              degree of detail and complexity in the documentation before us.
              That follows a requirement that I — and I would like to think
              that many, if not all, Members of the Assembly — would want to
              see upheld. We should be fully accountable; and we should provide
              all of the detail necessary to be accountable to the House for all
              of the expenditure that is undertaken in its name.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is still a case of a fundamental review
              of our processes, but we must confirm this in terms of resources
              and capital — as now required under resource budgeting — and
              deal with the varied responsibilities of different organisations
              in Departments, non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs),
              North/South bodies, et cetera, all of which affect the complexity
              of the material in front of us. I have no difficulty with the
              proposition that we should continually review and update our
              processes in all of these regards.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Francie Molloy and Seamus Close expressed
              concerns about the amounts of funding that have regularly become
              available for in-year allocation. It is clearly an important
              principle that money not required for the purpose for which it was
              originally allocated should be made available for reallocation by
              the Executive and the Assembly. The nature of the in-year
              monitoring process also means that it is important that
              Departments identify easements as early as possible in the year,
              so that the funding can be deployed elsewhere. Monitoring rounds
              are therefore designed to deal with short-term, emerging spending
              pressures and easements. They are not a proper means of addressing
              longer-term, strategic spending priorities, and successful in-year
              bids do not imply that the additional resources will be available
              in subsequent years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I imagine that, just as in the
              spending plans of almost any institution, if we were not in a
              position to address immediate pressures — emergencies — which
              cannot by their nature be anticipated when the detailed budgeting
              exercise is carried out, there would be significant complaints and
              concerns raised. If we were not to have the kind of flexibility
              that in-year monitoring provides us with, we would have to resort
              to an exercise such as reducing expenditure on programmes that
              were already in train. Members would find themselves faced with
              unenviable choices in that situation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While we endeavour to ensure that our budgetary
              planning is as precise and as focused as possible — I made this
              point to the Committee, and I did not hear any resiling from it
              — it is almost impossible to imagine a situation in which
              expenditure planned considerably in advance is going to be carried
              out in precisely the manner and to the last pound that it was
              planned for at that initial point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a href="#top">TOP</a></p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I explained in my opening remarks, the
              financial planning and budgetary cycle is lengthy. We are also in
              a time of transition, with new Departments undertaking new areas
              of work, and that can make it difficult to forecast accurately in
              advance. The Executive have agreed that we should look at our
              financial monitoring systems to see if we can understand the
              reasons for those underspends, with the aim of improving our
              forecasting.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive programme funds referred to by
              Patricia Lewsley are a means by which the Executive are determined
              to break away from inherited spending patterns and to ensure that
              resources are targeted in line with the Executive’s strategic
              priorities. They are a clear response to the demand, frequently
              heard in this Chamber, that we should be innovative and break away
              from the old patterns of expenditure. I do not believe that we can
              break away completely. Many Members, upon scrutiny of current
              expenditure, would agree that much of it is well justified and
              necessary in order to ensure that the services that it is there to
              provide can continue to be delivered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Notwithstanding that, the Executive have
              clearly stated that they want, within those constraints, to be
              innovative. We welcome views from Committees, and from the Floor
              of the House, with respect to how we might more effectively target
              Executive programme funds in future. Those funds represent a
              significant financial investment, and we need to be sure that they
              are achieving their objectives. We also wish to ensure that the
              processes for managing and allocating the funds are as efficient
              and effective as possible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is why the Executive are carrying out a
              review of the operation of the Executive programme funds. That
              review has been informed by the report of the Committee for
              Finance and Personnel. While the Executive have still to consider
              the review, there are some issues that will need to be addressed,
              such as the promotion of cross-cutting work by Departments and
              greater administrative simplicity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members, including Seamus Close, John
              Kelly and Jane Morrice, referred to the problems in health and
              personal social services. I should not forget to add to that list
              Robert McCartney, who made one of his infrequent appearances among
              us this afternoon. Those problems are of great concern to the
              Executive, and we recognise that there are very real problems that
              need to be addressed. Next year, health spending will be some
              £224 million higher than the provision for the current year. That
              is almost 10% — 9·7%, for those who are keen on mathematical
              accuracy. That represents a very significant addition and clearly
              demonstrates the importance that we attach to that area. I
              recognise that some Members may not consider that level of funding
              to be anywhere near adequate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As an Executive, we have to live within our
              overall budget, and additional funding for health and social care
              means less funding for some other area. The scale of the challenge
              facing the Executive has been made very clear today by the number
              of calls for increased spending on a variety of different
              programmes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also remind Members of the positive steps
              which the Executive have taken to control deficits and to try to
              ensure proper financial management and control in the Department
              of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. In response to a
              point raised by Jane Morrice, I confirm that the need for
              resources of £10 million for trust deficits was drawn to the
              Assembly’s attention in Mark Durkan’s statement on June
              monitoring. It is not something new that has been sprung upon us
              today. The Executive’s decision was made public during the
              summer recess.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also need to recognise that additional
              resources represent only part of the solution. We must ensure that
              the expenditure that we are allocating is used to the greatest
              possible effect. To that end, we are carrying out a needs and
              effectiveness evaluation into health and social care so that we
              can better understand what we achieve with what we spend.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will appreciate that there are no easy
              answers. We will be paying careful attention to the question of
              health expenditure in our analysis of next year’s spending
              review. The Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel
              questioned the proposed local strategic partnership formula. This
              issue has caused concern, and I attempted to address it earlier
              during Question Time. I can confirm that the proposed allocations
              are consistent with the overall objectives of the Peace II
              programme, and that the use of population weighted by deprivation
              is a specific European Commission requirement in the operational
              programme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Francie Molloy also called for greater
              investment west of the Bann, invoking new targeting social need as
              the basis for his call. The policy aims to tackle social need and
              social exclusion throughout Northern Ireland. This will mean using
              more of our existing resources to benefit people and areas in
              greatest objective social need. It also means delivering our
              policies in ways that are more helpful to those in need. New
              targeting social need is implemented through a range of policies
              and programmes, and I am confident that it will have a positive
              impact on tackling unemployment and addressing inequality wherever
              those problems exist.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eddie McGrady raised the question of additional
              funding announcements for English programmes such as health,
              education and transport. I can confirm that my officials closely
              monitor those areas as part of their regular liaison with the
              Treasury. Of course, any resultant resources are referred to the
              Executive for decisions on allocation, usually in the next
              available monitoring round, rather than simply going to the
              comparable programme here. However, I caution Members to read the
              small print when they hear announcements made in Whitehall or
              elsewhere before making points about an immediate consequential
              allocation here, proportionate to what may or may not have been
              announced across the water.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady asked whether funding was available
              for the implementation of the Hayes review. The Executive will
              shortly be considering how to take that review forward and will be
              carefully examining the potential expenditure implications over
              the coming months. Mr McGrady also asked about residential care
              for the elderly. Last year, the Minister of Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety established an interdepartmental
              working group to examine the costs and implications of introducing
              free personal care. Once this group reports its findings, the
              Executive will need to consider the implications of this policy in
              light of their other priorities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same Member also raised the identification
              of additional sources of funding for public services. This is a
              key area for further consideration, and its importance to the
              Executive is evidenced by its inclusion as a priority in the
              Programme for Government, with actions on such issues as
              public-private partnerships and a review of rating policy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eddie McGrady, Rev Dr Ian Paisley and Rev Dr
              William McCrea raised the issue of funding for agricultural
              development in 2002-03. The position on the vision group has been
              advised to the Assembly on several occasions. The consultation
              period has ended, and the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
              Development has begun to draw up a strategic plan of action to
              take the process forward. Early retirement and new entrants
              schemes will be considered as part of the action plan. As yet, no
              funds have been allocated to implement the vision group’s
              recommendations in 2002-03. As Members will appreciate from what I
              have just said, a great deal of the hard work is being undertaken
              to formulate the precise proposals that arise out of the vision
              group’s report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley raised the issue of a
              definition of rural proofing. Executive approval to a formal
              definition of rural proofing has not yet been given. However, the
              concept of rural proofing is a process that ensures that all
              relevant Executive policies are examined carefully and objectively
              to determine whether they have a different impact in rural areas.
              It examines the characteristics of rural areas and, where
              necessary, what policy adjustments may be made to reflect rural
              needs and to ensure that, as far as possible, public services are
              accessible on a fair basis to the rural community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ian Paisley Jnr and Jane Morrice asked why
              payments in respect of animal disease compensation have risen
              sharply in recent years, and George Savage also raised the issue
              of variations. It has been normal practice to allocate additional
              resources to the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
              in-year to meet pressures in that area. However, steps were taken
              in the 2000 spending review to enable the baseline to reflect the
              needs more accurately. Reviews of all aspects of control measures
              for brucellosis and tuberculosis are currently under way, and
              consideration will be given to the introduction of further, or
              different, measures to lower their incidences. The reviews will be
              completed in two to three months.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jane Morrice sought confirmation that no moneys
              would be returned to Brussels from the Peace I programme. Our
              latest estimates show that we expect to achieve a full spend under
              the programme, although it will be some time before we receive
              formal confirmation of that. With respect to pensions and their
              allocation in the Department of Finance and Personnel budget, the
              costs are borne in annually managed expenditure and, therefore, do
              not restrict or affect the pressures available for allocation by
              the Executive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the detail, the main reason for
              the £19 million rise is increased transfer costs — in other
              words, scheme members who transfer to other schemes. The second
              reason for the increase is the early retirement of members who
              have reached 60 years of age. They fall within the scope of the
              scheme for the first time. The age profile of the Civil Service
              and a consequent higher number of staff reaching retirement age
              also contribute to the increase.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea raised a point about
              nurses. Some years ago there was a reduction in the numbers
              entering training for nursing, which has led to a decline in the
              numbers entering the profession. The Department recently increased
              the numbers to be admitted to training, but it will take some time
              to increase the numbers working in the profession. Sammy Wilson
              suggested that better use of resources allocated to North/South
              bodies could be achieved by channelling those resources elsewhere,
              especially to health.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Members of the Assembly that — as I
              have attempted to underline several times — health is a priority
              of the Executive. However, that is not to say that we should spend
              all of our money on health and none on anything else.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members will be aware through reports
              brought to the Floor of the House by Ministers attending meetings
              of the Council, the North/South Ministerial Council is developing
              programmes of considerable benefit in a wide range of areas, from
              trade, to education, to cultural matters of benefit to communities
              North and South. As the projects associated with the plans of the
              North/South Ministerial Council and its various implementation
              bodies roll out, the establishment of the Council will be
              vindicated by the benefits which will be felt, particularly in
              border areas, and throughout the North and South.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have attempted to cover almost all of the
              main points made by Members in their contributions. However, I am
              aware that I have been unable to cover all of the points that they
              have raised. Those that have not been touched upon in my
              concluding remarks will receive a written response, either from
              myself or from the Minister directly responsible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once again, I want to acknowledge that I regard
              this debate as having been significant, certainly for myself, as I
              am still in my infant days with regard to the responsibilities in
              the Department of Finance and Personnel. The learning curve is
              steep, but it has been a helpful contribution to progressing up
              that curve, whether from Members whose remarks were highly
              critical of what I, as spokesperson for the Executive today, am
              attempting to do or from the smaller number whose remarks were
              complimentary. Nonetheless, I acknowledge Members’ contributions
              in both respects.</p>
