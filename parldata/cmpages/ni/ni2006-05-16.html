			<td><p class="H1DocumentHeading">The Assembly</p>
				<p class="H2DocumentDate">Tuesday 16 May 2006</p>
				<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 2.00 pm (Madam Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
				<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
				<p class="H3SectionHeading">Assembly Business</p>
				<p class="H4StageHeading">Roll of Membership</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  In accordance with the Northern Ireland Act 2006, the Secretary of State has  directed that the Assembly should sit on Tuesday 16 May 2006 at 2.00 pm to  consider business as it appears on the Order Paper.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I have had an opportunity to scrutinise the entries in the  Roll of Membership, and I am satisfied that all 108 Members have taken their  seats in accordance with Standing Orders.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Regarding designations of identity, six Members entered  designations that I have deemed to be &ldquo;Other&rdquo; for the purposes of Standing  Orders. Members will find details of the designations in the minutes of  proceedings for yesterday&rsquo;s sitting.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">At the end of yesterday&rsquo;s sitting, a matter was raised as a  point of order, and I agreed to give it careful consider&shy;ation. I am currently  seeking advice from Speaker&rsquo;s counsel, and I shall report back to the House  when I have had the opportunity to consider the matter fully.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Robert  McCartney</strong>: On a point of order, Madam Speaker. Before the business of this  body commences, I wish to make a point of order on the status of this body and  you as its appointed Speaker. The media in general, and the British  Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in particular, continue to refer to this body as  &ldquo;the Assembly&rdquo;. That has caused widespread public confusion, which should be  removed.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Madam Speaker, you are aware that this is not the Assembly  to which Members were elected in November 2003: it is simply a body that the  Secretary of State has invited the Members then elected to attend.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Thank you, Mr McCartney. Can I stop you there? According to the Northern  Ireland Act 2006, this is &ldquo;the Assembly&rdquo;. It is not the Northern Ireland  Assembly and will not be the Northern Ireland Assembly until we restore full  devolution. I was appointed by the Secretary of State, as were the two Deputy  Speakers, under the Act, which is at the direction of the Secretary of State.  All Assembly business is at the direction of the Secretary of State.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Robert  McCartney</strong>: Perhaps, Madam Speaker, you would permit me to finish my point  of order. The Assembly, or this body, like Parliament, Congress or the French  National Assembly, elects its Speaker to determine the Standing Orders for the  conduct of business and the nature of the business to be debated. None of that  applies to this body, convocation or assembly, however it may be described.  You, Madam Speaker, were nominated by the Secretary of State, and, as you  rightly say, the Secretary of State describes how business is to be conducted  because he determines and amends, on a daily basis, the Standing Orders. He  also determines what the business is to be. Now you, Madam Speaker, I believe  unwittingly, said yesterday that you were the servant &mdash;</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Mr McCartney, have you a question?</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Robert  McCartney</strong>: Yes, but I have to frame it.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I have to say that your information so far has been quite inaccurate. As I said  before, this is &ldquo;the Assembly&rdquo; and it is at the direction of the Secretary of  State. All business must first be agreed in the Business Committee; it then  goes to the Secretary of State, and an Order Paper comes back. That is the way  it is. Unfortunately, until we get restored devolution that is the way it will  remain.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Robert  McCartney</strong>: Madam Speaker, with respect, that may be the case. However, yesterday  you declared that you were, and hoped to be, the servant of this Assembly.  Since the New Testament was published:</p>
				<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;No man can serve two masters&rdquo;.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Which is to be your master, Madam Speaker?</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Order. After my appointment by the Secretary of State, I asked, in my personal  statement, that Members realise that I am here as their servant. I hope that  when we get full devolution we can look at the matter and, if necessary, elect  a Speaker as you suggest. I think that we have had enough of that point of  order.</p>
				<p class="H3SectionHeading">Secretary of State Motion</p>
				<p class="H4StageHeading">Economic Challenges and <br>
					Proposed Working Group</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I wish to advise that the motion was referred to the Assembly by the Secretary  of State and is not subject to amendment. The Business Committee has agreed  that a minimum of two hours be set aside for the debate. The Committee also  agreed that the first round of speeches should be limited to 10 minutes, with  subsequent Members being allowed five minutes. I intend to send a copy of the  Official Report of the debate to the Secretary of State.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion made:</p>
				<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Assembly considers the economic challenges  facing Northern Ireland, in the context of both the UK and all island  economies, to be a key priority for a restored Executive and calls on the  Business Committee to take forward establishing a working group on this issue  to make recommendations to a restored Executive. &mdash; [The Secretary of State.]</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  It is fitting that we discuss the Northern Ireland economy after this morning&rsquo;s  presentation from the Northern Ireland Business Alliance. I put on record my  appreciation of those who gave it. It was informative.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Like so many people, families and communities, Northern  Ireland&rsquo;s entire economic fabric was targeted for destruction by terrorists.  When the IRA gave its stand-down order last year, it claimed that on every  front where it had visited death and destruction, it was, and I quote,  &ldquo;entirely legitimate&rdquo;.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Those who gave their unqualified support to that claim must  convince us that they now have a true concern for our economic well-being. One  of the first duties of an Administration is to advance its country&rsquo;s economy.  Ongoing criminality means that Northern Ireland is still denied devolution in  which local economic affairs are administered by locally accountable  representatives. However, it is my hope that others will embrace democracy and  that we shall have it.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The absence of full devolution should not inhibit direct  rule Ministers from exercising their powers to do what is right by Northern  Ireland&rsquo;s economy &mdash; and there is much to do. Northern Ireland has enjoyed  steady economic growth, with employment at an all-time high. However, our  manufacturing base is eroding steadily, basic business costs are on the up, and  reliance on the public sector remains dangerously high.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">We need to find ways to diminish or even eradicate those  elements that are a cause for concern and ensure that any economic indicator  points in the right direction. Any future Executive must grapple with eight key  foundations to encourage and underpin economic growth. These are a reduction in  red tape and regulation; a concentration on skills development; an enhanced  infrastructure; an improved planning process; lower business costs; a more  attractive taxation system; reform of Invest Northern Ireland; and an efficient  Government. If ever there were unnecessary intrusion of politics into business,  it is in the expansion of business-based bureaucracy.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">A priority for any future local Administration should be  the unravelling of as much Government-generated red tape as it can. Businesses  should be set free and allowed to get on with their work. Our economy lacks the  required skills in many sectors, and that is not helped by high levels of  economically inactive people. Business and Government need to combine to bring  the right people with the right skills through the education system.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">A proper partnership between an Executive, business and the  individuals themselves is required to tool our economy for an increasingly  competitive and cut-throat global economy. My party is consistent in calling  for any future economic package to be ploughed into enhancing our ailing  infrastructure. Thirty years of terrorism have deprived our roads, water and  sewerage systems of much needed funds. Business would benefit as much as the general  population from a better infrastructure.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Too many potential new investors or existing companies with  an eye to expansion are put off by our cumbersome and constricting planning  laws and procedures. An overhaul of the planning process could assist business  growth immensely. Increased energy, insurance and fuel costs and new costs such  as industrial rates deter growth and even discourage many from continuing to  operate in this country.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Some of those costs are the Government&rsquo;s direct  responsibility. The Government must strike the right balance between making  business a financial contribution to the economy and ensuring that business  retains its competitive edge. My party and I have pressed the Government hard  on reducing our corporation tax rate, and some months ago I secured an  Adjournment debate on that subject in the House of Commons. Some progress was  made with the then Minister with responsibility for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment, and I hope to take this up soon with her replacement.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">In our competition with the South &mdash; and let us not forget  that the South is our economic competitor &mdash; corporation tax is the main and  crucial difference. A rate of corporation tax lower than that of the Republic could  increase the overall tax take as existing companies expand and new ones enter  Northern Ireland. If that is too unpalatable for the Government, then we need  to examine the possibility of bringing about a cocktail of measures that has  the same net effect of lower overall tax for businesses.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Does he agree that there will be a major  problem in getting a reduction of corporation tax in Northern Ireland with the  continuing joint administration between the British Government, the Northern  Ireland Office and the Southern Irish Government?</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">It is highly unlikely that the South of Ireland that he  refers to as our competitor will allow us to introduce a more incentive-based  corporation tax system in Northern Ireland than exists in the Republic.</p>
				<p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  I do not think that we should have that defeatist attitude, but I see where the  Member is coming from. I accept that it will be difficult, but through a  cocktail of funding we may be able to get to the level that we require.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I would be grateful if the Member could address his remarks through the Chair.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  That is not a problem, Madam Speaker, and I apologise. I will ensure that I  keep looking in this direction.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  A very pleasant view it is too.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>: Madam  Speaker, you will notice that I did not say that.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Reform of Invest Northern Ireland is also required, but  equally important is a refocus of its work. Instead of concentrating on micro  businesses that merely redistribute wealth or looking into the world for  solutions to all our economic ills, let us make the most of what we have, sell  it well, and assist it to the full instead of chasing pipe dreams.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Any future Executive should make efficiencies in its own  structures. Efficiency does not necessarily equate to job losses in the public  sector, but there should be a realisation and recognition that we can no longer  rely on the public sector to drive Northern Ireland. Progress on those issues  is absolutely essential if Northern Ireland&rsquo;s economy is to lead in the right  direction. However, I caution everyone not to fall into the trap of thinking  that the Assembly is the answer to everything, given that we are as susceptible  to global economic trends as every other economy.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Government must fix what is wrong instead of pursuing their  fascination with fads and fantasies such as an all-Ireland economy. The motion  is interesting, however, in that it refers to the UK economy, recognising our  place there, and simply to an all-island economy, recognising the existence of  two jurisdictions. Perhaps we could help our Southern neighbour and use the  gravitational pull of the much larger UK economy to drag the South closer to  the United Kingdom. We wish for good relations with our nearest neighbour. We  are willing to co-operate if there are clear lines of self-interest for  Northern Ireland, but the economic and financial cake is far greater and the  benefits far larger.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: Does my hon Friend remember that the South of Ireland benefited by  &pound;5 million a day for a number of years from the European fund? If Mr Simpson  gave me that for Northern Ireland, I, too, could have a tiger machinery for  business &mdash; the Celtic tiger &mdash; I am sorry, I missed its nationality.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  I do not know whether to comment on that, Madam Speaker. A debate will soon  take place in the Province on whether the Celtic tiger is sustainable, so it  will be interesting to hear the outcome of that. To concentrate exclusively on  an all-Ireland economy might do well for a tree-hugger but not in the real  world.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I remind the Member that his time is drawing near. <em>[Laughter.]</em> Time is short,  Mr Simpson.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  I am nearly finished. We have had many advantages that have often been  overlooked, not least our inherent spirit of entrepreneurship. Government  should work alongside business and not against it. That can become the  challenge that faces us to start us on our way to a brighter economic country.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  In recent years, an element of complacency has entered into the treatment of  our economy. This is partly due to the fact that we have been consistently  producing low unemployment figures that are very appealing on the surface and  look as though we are, in fact, making progress, but they hide a number of  underlying weaknesses.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">No regional economy, such as our own, is isolated from the  real world. We are well aware of that. In Northern Ireland, to some extent, we  live in a public expenditure bubble, which is relatively high. However, many  would argue that it is entirely consistent with our needs. Nevertheless, our  entrepreneurial private sector is much smaller than those in other regions of  the United Kingdom and, indeed, further afield.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">We must highlight, therefore, that, although the surface  level of unemployment appears low, it disguises the fact that there are skills  shortages and that we are bringing in foreign labour. Many manufacturing plants  in Northern Ireland are dominated by labour from other parts of the European  Union or from further afield. It disguises also the fact that there are still  large numbers of people who do not have fulfilling and worthwhile jobs.  Although that situation is, to some extent, disguised by events, it is an  underlying fact that must be taken into account.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Just as our politics and society need devolution, it is  important to note that the experiences in Scotland and Wales have shown that  those regional economies, which face similar challenges to our economy, have benefited  from local Ministers and devolved institutions.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  Does the Member agree also that the advantages of devolution in those two parts  of the United Kingdom &mdash; Scotland and Wales &mdash; have been based on coalition  Government, agreed voluntarily by democratically elected parties? Is today not  a fine example of how the democratic parties here could move ahead to form a  voluntary coalition?</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  The Member makes a valid point. Indeed, one hopes the day will come when that  is exactly how Governments are formed here &mdash; if we have them. However, not only  have the devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales delivered coherent  economic strategies, related education and skills policies to economic needs,  and worked in partnership with the business and trade union sectors, they have  used UK, European and international platforms to talk up their regional  economies. Indeed, even though they do not have devolution, regions in the  north-east and north-west of England have developed elaborate skills policies  and have been trying to retain their young graduates so that they can reduce  the brain drain.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">As Northern Ireland&rsquo;s business community knows, the  contrast between the performance of devolution in other parts of the UK and our  direct rule Administration is inevitably stark and obvious. Clearly, Northern  Ireland used to be the odd man out in the UK, as the only area with devolution.  Now, the situation has turned around, and we are the odd man out because we no  longer have devolution. Although we should not exaggerate what devolution can  do, it can make a contribution.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Recognising the key role of the manufacturing sector must  be fundamental to the economic vision of any future devolved Administration in  Northern Ireland. Again, the lead given by the Scottish and Welsh devolved  Administrations offers a model for us in this part of the UK. Scotland&rsquo;s  manufacturing strategy, entitled &lsquo;Created in Scotland&rsquo;, and the Welsh  manufacturing forum are evidence of a genuine commitment to a dynamic future  for the sector in those regions.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">While the Scottish Executive have given a commit&shy;ment to  keep business rates competitive, alongside a small business rates relief  scheme, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s manufacturers are, of course, facing the imminent  end of industrial derating. This historical concession pre-dated our entry into  the EU. Thereby, it was not contrary to EU competition laws. Now, manufacturers  will be disadvantaged because of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s differences and because of  the fact that our energy costs, which were the quid pro quo promised to the  manufacturing sector if rates were introduced, have not been reduced. The  commitment of &pound;200 million made by Minister Pearson in September 2003 to offset  the cost to industry has not been followed through as envisaged.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Consequently, the manufacturing sector is facing the double  whammy of increasing rates and energy costs and, of course, transport costs.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">This Assembly ought to be able to address that fundamental  issue. The manufacturing sector has convincingly demonstrated that the  Administration&rsquo;s present policy could cost the Northern Ireland economy job  opportunities.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The hon Member for North Antrim, Dr Paisley, made the point  about aid to the Republic &mdash; I believe it was called the cohesion fund, and it  was available to only four countries in the European Union &mdash; which has given  them an enormous boost, but in fairness they have gone further and identified  their next target area, namely fourth-level education. When we were dismantling  our technical school and college education, they introduced it, and that  provided a flow of labour qualified to meet the needs of industry. A local  Administration could tailor policies to the needs of local businesses.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Ensuring that our workforce has the skills to compete in  the knowledge-based economy of the twenty-first century must be a priority.  Whether it is ensuring that our higher education institutions and colleges are  attuned to the needs of our economy, or addressing the scandal of poor literacy  and numeracy skills among our school-leavers, any economic vision for Northern  Ireland will be mere words unless small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and  multinationals have access to a skilled labour market.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The hon Member for Upper Bann, Mr David Simpson, mentioned  regulation. Attempts have been made to reduce regulation but, sadly, much of it  derives from European Union legislation, to which our national Government sign  up without necessarily understanding the downstream consequences &mdash; and they  certainly do not have to meet the downstream costs.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Does the Member accept that when we sign up to EU directives we &ldquo;gold-plate&rdquo;  the regulations, thus making them far more severe in this part of Europe than  in other parts? Perhaps that is what we should be addressing.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  That is a valid point. It is often said that a seven-page document from Brussels  comes out of a Whitehall Department as a 70-page document. We seem to be  excessively rigorous in the enforcement of these measures.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I am sure that the Member is aware of the recent report titled, &lsquo;Investing in  Regeneration, Unlocking the Belfast Opportunity&rsquo;. It makes a salient point  about the problem of over-regulation, which the Member has touched on. However,  it also states that in 2004 in excess of &pound;1 billion was taken away from local  investment in Northern Ireland and put into GB, principally because regulation  here was preventing the entrepreneurial spirit from flourishing.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I agree that there has been a significant and proud tradition of innovation and  entrepreneurial skills in this part of the United Kingdom. Somehow we seem to  have moved away from that. At this morning&rsquo;s presentation, Mr Paisley Jnr  referred to the paintings of industrial scenes in the Senate Chamber, and that  is very poignant. A local devolved Administration could contribute to  encouraging the restoration of such industry. Of course, that cannot be  achieved without the link to education at basic, further and higher levels.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">We should not ignore the challenges, but nor should we fail  to recognise the potential of the innovative approaches that our colleagues in  the rest of the United Kingdom have taken. Devolution can mean the end of  complacency and the beginning of a new, dynamic, nimble and agile approach &mdash; an  expression that was used in this morning&rsquo;s presentation. I commend those ideas  to Members.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farren</strong>:  The SDLP supports the general terms of this motion. We accept that, as we  prepare for devolution, we need to examine not just how we can modernise and  develop the economy of Northern Ireland on its own, but how we must do so  bearing in mind the opportunities offered by a joint approach to Ireland-wide  economic development, as well as the opportunities that exist in the wider EU  and global contexts.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I stress the SDLP&rsquo;s outward-looking approach, because of  frequent accusations that we are fixated on looking inward or southward and  have no regard to other dimensions and contexts &mdash; the SDLP recognises the  global nature of the economy in which we live.</p>
				<p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP&rsquo;s objectives include maximising the economic  potential of the whole island through a joint approach to planning and  delivering infrastructure developments in roads, transport, energy supply,  telecommunications, health, education and many other services where it makes  sense to do so and where, in the words of the Good Friday Agreement, such  developments would be to the &ldquo;mutual benefit&rdquo; of communities in both parts of  the country. As has often been stated recently, those opportunities have never  been better. At current estimates, over &pound;100 billion will be spent over the  next decade on basic infrastructure, North and South.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The distance we must travel in order to become a more  successful economy can be measured in the gap between two major investments  announced just three months ago: one for an enlarged retail development in east  Belfast and the other for a pharmaceutical enterprise near Cork. Each promises  around 400 new jobs, but there the similarities end.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The investment in east Belfast &mdash; welcome as it is &mdash;  promises jobs at the lower end of the skills range; many are part time and many  are at the lower end of the wage scale. In contrast, 80% of the jobs at the  pharmaceutical enterprise in Cork, announced in the same week, will be for  highly qualified and skilled graduates. When did we last have such investments?  It is very hard to recall, because they have been few and far between.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">To reach the point where the norm is investment offering  many more opportunities for highly skilled, well-paid technicians and  graduates, where those investments challenge our universities and institutes of  further and higher education to produce a workforce capable of servicing  technologically and intellectually challenging employment and where research  and development increases from its current very low levels, needs a much more  concerted and comprehensive approach than at present.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">That approach must be supported by new fiscal and other  incentives that put us on a more level playing pitch with the South&rsquo;s  headline-grabbing 12&middot;5% corporation tax and with the many other economies  emerging in central and eastern Europe. Those economies are liable to attract  much of the mobile international investment, if we are not able to match the  incentives that they offer.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Although I welcome and acknowledge that our neighbour&rsquo;s economy is doing  extremely well, does Dr Farren accept that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s economy was  blighted and stymied for years by gunmen and gangsters, who carried out the  most vicious campaign of terror against the economy to wreck this country, to  wreck investment and to wreck stability &mdash; and all in the name of Ireland? Does  he thoroughly oppose that?</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farren</strong>:  Not only the effects of the troubles, but the failures to develop sustained  partnership arrangements within this institution and to sustain the North/South  institutions established by the Good Friday Agreement have continued to inhibit  the development of the economy. The SDLP is working to ensure that all  institutions are restored, so that we can ensure that the economy moves forward  in the way that we all want.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">To return to my theme, incentives alone will not be  sufficient to enable us to move the economy forward in a step change.  Underlying the success that we have seen in the South, there has been a strong  social partnership with real buy-in from all of the key partners: trade unions;  the voluntary sector; and business. This partnership has been in existence for  well over 15 years, and it has given a high degree of stability &mdash; both  political and social &mdash; to the South&rsquo;s economy. The right fiscal incentives and  the right workforce are also key to thriving economies worldwide.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, if we are to move from a public sector-dependent  economy to one that has a greater reliance on wealth creation, we will not do  so over the heads of the social partners. We also need a similar strong social  partnership. I do not believe that the Economic Development Forum (EDF) as it  is presently constructed &mdash; representative and all that it is &mdash; is the best  forum for ensuring the kind of objectives that I believe need to be set for a  real vibrant social partnership.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">In such a partnership, poverty elimination stands side by  side with wealth creation and greater productivity as common targets. The  delivery of quality public services is a common concern. Equality and fair  treatment of all workers &mdash; whatever their origin or background &mdash; are  guaranteed. The delivery of such a social partnership requires the leadership  that a return to devolution, to the North/South Ministerial Council and to all  the other elements of the Good Friday Agreement alone can provide.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">While the SDLP supports the motion of creating a working  party as a necessary means of preparing for devolution, it is no substitute for  devolution. The sooner that we can move towards achieving that aim, the better  it will be &mdash; not just for our politics but also for our economy.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Madam Speaker, I welcome the debate. However, may I say that for months my  colleagues in the Alliance Party have been trying to persuade the Secretary of  State to set up an economic forum involving elected members of the Assembly.  The economy is an issue that has gained consensus across all the political  parties, and I am pleased that over recent weeks I have shared a cross-party  platform on matters relating to the economy.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The modern economy is very complex. We have the whole issue  of globalisation. Who would have thought that we would see such development in  the likes of China and India as we have seen in recent times? We are also  dealing with issues relating to the enlargement of the European Union, and in  Northern Ireland we are in a unique situation in which our nearest neighbour is  dealing in a different currency. Therefore, there are a lot of challenges to  deal with, but there is also a great number of opportunities. It is also worth  saying that society is changing rapidly, and I suggest that in every decade  over recent times there has been a new industrial revolution. That is a  challenge for us all to meet.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Following on from this morning&rsquo;s meeting with the business  sector, an important factor to consider is that in many ways it is up to us to  create the climate in which we can move from a public-sector economy to a  private- sector economy. An important issue in relation to that is for us to  provide the necessary joined-up government.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I pose this question to Members: was the artificial  creation of 10 Departments helpful to moving forward the economy? We must deal  with that issue. When we had the Review of Public Administration (RPA), the  Departments should have been reviewed at the same time.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we realise the problems that  businesses face daily due to lack of co-operation among various Departments. We  have been dealing with planning, which is one of the big issues. Other Members  &mdash; Sammy Wilson in particular &mdash; and I have been working on planning, which is  one area that must be investigated.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">We have discussed corporation tax, particularly when  compared with the lower levels in the Republic of Ireland. I know that I will  not receive universal support in the Chamber, but I still believe that this  Assembly should request tax-varying powers. Those powers could allow us to deal  with the issue of corporation tax, as well as a number of other public issues.  We have seen how the Scottish Parliament has successfully reformed services as  a result of its having tax-varying powers.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the tax burden increased when the Scottish  Parliament got its hands on tax-varying powers? That seems to be at odds with  the argument being made that we should try to encourage the private sector to  invest in Northern Ireland, because we know that higher taxation and  private-sector investment are not compatible. Higher taxation will tend to  discourage the private sector from investing here.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  certainly believe that if we are to move forward the economy, we must find some  way to bring about the necessary fiscal reform. The issue of tax-varying powers  should be considered.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Although it is an enchanting argument that we should have a different rate of  corporation tax &mdash; I understand how attractive that would be to various  businesses &mdash; will the Member respond to these two points?</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">First, does the Member think that a different rate of  corporation tax will help to create the 141,000 jobs that we need in Northern  Ireland before 2015?</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, if we get tax-varying powers, does he accept that  the British Government will ask for a quid pro quo, which could involve putting  the Barnett formula on the table? To do so would unravel a very beneficial  formula that provides us with the rest of our subvention.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  As we found out from this morning&rsquo;s discussions, there is more than one issue.  We must develop an entire package of reforms in order to create the climate in  which the economy can move forward. In fact, the DUP, along with the other  parties, met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Hain, to  discuss industrial derating. The purpose of industrial derating was to allow  Northern Ireland to compete with the lower rates of corporation tax in the  Republic of Ireland. At least some consensus exists. It is important, however,  that we develop a package of reforms.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I am also concerned about the amount of investment that is  being taken out of Northern Ireland, because of the complex situation here, and  invested in other parts of the UK. If I may say so, considerable investment is  going to the Republic of Ireland as well. That issue must be dealt with. If we  are to create the 141,000 jobs to which Ian Paisley Jnr referred, there must be  reform.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Investment in research and development was highlighted this  morning. The small-business sector is important, so we should acknowledge one  of the biggest problems, which is the fact that 89% of those currently employed  in the private sector work for companies that employ 10 or fewer people. That  issue must be addressed.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I also hope that the Assembly will get the opportunity to  deal with the reform of the education system. It is important that the  education system that we develop recognises and acknowledges the needs of  modern society and business. When Nortel was expanding some years ago, the  local further education colleges provided courses to develop the skills  necessary for it. The education system should recognise the needs of business  and the economy.</p>
				<p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Apart from Ian Paisley Jnr no one mentioned tourism this  morning. It is an important element of the modern Northern Ireland economy, and  we can see it expanding throughout Northern Ireland not only yearly, but daily.  Tourism must be provided with the necessary facilities to expand. Finally,  Madam Speaker &mdash;</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Dodds</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Yes.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Dodds</strong>:  Tourism is vital to the economy and could form part of a new vision for the  economy in Northern Ireland. The Member also referred to the reform of the 10  artificial Government Departments. We also need to look at the creation of the  artificial cross-border bodies that deal specifically with tourism. Northern  Ireland pays twice as much to Tourism Ireland &mdash; over &pound;22 million a year &mdash; as it  invests in tourism in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Tourist Board  announced five signature projects, but the one for Belfast has no central  Government funding promised for it and is proceeding with an application to the  Big Lottery Fund. Tourism can advance Northern Ireland &mdash; <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
				<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I hope that the Member agrees that not only is  tourism important but that the cross-border bodies are also important.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  appreciate that very much, but &mdash;</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I am sorry, Mr Neeson, but your time is up.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Robert  McCartney</strong>: On a point of order, Madam Speaker. Unless the Chair limits  interventions, Members will not give way, since the time spent on an  intervention comes off their speaking time.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Order. Members must limit their own interventions.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr N Dodds</strong>:  On a point of order, Madam Speaker. There would be merit in considering the  procedure in the House of Commons: if a Member intervenes in a time-limited  speech, an extra minute or so is added for each intervention, with a maximum of  two interventions allowed. It is then up to the Member to decide whether they  wish to give way, and if they do they are not penalised for that.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Dodds. We will certainly consider that at the next meeting of the  Business Committee.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  This morning&rsquo;s meeting underpinned the importance of this debate. I am sure  that most Members would agree that real peace in Northern Ireland, if we ever  get it, would have to be underpinned by economic prosperity. However,  underpinning any successful Western economy these days is the necessity for  everyone of working age at all levels to attain skills and knowledge. I would  like to consider briefly three areas that require understanding and attention  to deliver a highly skilled workforce: the background to skills development;  skills in the context of industry&rsquo;s needs; and the development of  entrepreneurial skills.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Under the Industrial Training Act (Northern Ireland) 1964,  Northern Ireland once had a vocational training programme that was the envy of  Europe. Statutory training boards covered all major sectors of industry, and  the government training centres provided excellence in basic training for those  undertaking apprenticeships. That is no longer the case; that system of  training was demolished by a Conservative Government.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Recognising the need to move away from what were purely  voluntary arrangements for vocational job training, the Government have seen  fit to develop an infrastructure referred to as the Sector Skills Develop&shy;ment  Agency (SSDA). The recent formation of the SSDA &mdash; and, coming from that, the  Sector Skills Councils &mdash; is a welcome move. While they go some way to meeting  industry&rsquo;s needs, they do not completely fill the gap left by the closure of  all but one of the statutory boards. The recruitment by employers of eastern  European labour to meet skills shortages evidences that.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The UK-wide Sector Skills Councils are currently  establishing their presence in Northern Ireland, and the type of provision  varies from industry to industry. In order to ensure that the sector skills  requirements are met, each council is developing an agreement for its sector.  It is fundamentally important that those agreements, developed as they are  within a UK-wide framework, are resourced and placed in the context of Northern  Ireland industry.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The Government&rsquo;s recent programme of job-training  provision, Jobskills, was described as one of the worst initiatives the Public  Accounts Committee had ever examined. The poor ethos, delivery and standard of  this &pound;500 million programme must never be repeated. It let down the business  community. It created poor morale among many trainees and within the bodies  that delivered the programme.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Embedded in the Jobskills programme was the modern  apprenticeship training programme. The scheme did few favours to our brightest  young people who wanted to embark on vocational training as engineers,  electricians or plumbers, with many leaving the programme without qualifying.  The replacement programmes, as Jobskills is under review, must offer those who  want to &ldquo;serve their time&rdquo; &mdash; our future technicians and technologists &mdash; training  of the highest quality, based on real jobs, rather than just training places.  The young people who take up apprenticeships need good guidance when they are  ready to make a career choice. They also need to know that there is a career  path in their chosen occupation. Let us remember that many of Northern  Ireland&rsquo;s leading businessmen started their careers as apprentices.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The business community needs assurances from Government  agencies that a well-trained, educated labour force will be available to meet  identified needs. The economy demands a joined-up skills strategy.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">In its document &lsquo;The Skills Strategy for Northern Ireland:  A Programme for Implementation&rsquo;, the Department for Employment and Learning  (DEL) identified three different types of skills. First, there are the  essential skills of literacy and numeracy and, increasingly, information and  communications tech&shy;nology. It is sad that in my constituency 17,000 people  have difficulty with reading and writing. Secondly, DEL identifies  employability skills to enable young people to learn to work as part of a team  and to undertake problem-solving exercises. Finally, perhaps the most important  from the economic perspective, there are the work-based skills, specific to a  particular occupation or sector.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The document sets out how DEL will take those proposals  forward in partnership with employers and their representative bodies &mdash;</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  Madam Speaker, if I could just finish &mdash;</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I am afraid that the Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Birnie</strong>:  Why should we debate this motion? Well, economic policy is a classic example of  how direct rule is not working. There has, first, been pervasive delay in the  making of policy. In February 2005, the Northern Ireland Office published &lsquo;Economic  Vision for Northern Ireland&rsquo;. That document stated that it would be followed in  autumn 2005 by a joined-up economic strategy for all the Northern Ireland  Departments. Autumn came, then winter; now we are in summer 2006, and there is  still no economic strategy.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Of course, our Secretary of State loves to chide MLAs for  supposedly not doing their assigned jobs. It is worse than that, however.  Economic policy under direct rule has shown signs of irrationality. When a new  policy is introduced, it must be benchmarked by looking at what was done before  to see what worked and what did not work. Unfortunately the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the other Departments have not been doing  that under direct rule.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">&lsquo;Economic Vision for Northern Ireland&rsquo; was published last  year with much heralding. It outlined two major targets to test and evaluate  economic improve&shy;ment: first, raising the productivity of people at work; and  secondly, raising the proportion of the population in work. There is no quarrel  with the objectives; they are sensible. It should always be remembered that  some people argue that up to 500,000 people here live in relative poverty.  Surely it would have been sensible, before or during the introduction of  &lsquo;Economic Vision for Northern Ireland&rsquo;, to ask what had become of what was  still, at that point, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s economic strategy, &lsquo;Strategy 2010&rsquo;,  which was published in 1999. Some Members may remember it.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">It seems that &lsquo;Strategy 2010&rsquo;, like so many others  policies, be they in education or in health, has been consigned to that great  dustbin of policy documents as if it were some redundant plan that Stalinist  Russia threw out. We have never been told whether the policy was working. Did  it realise its targets, of which there were 10? In about half of the targets &mdash;  for example, gross domestic product per head here; wages here relative to those  in Great Britain; new-firm creation; R&amp;D spending; and possibly export  levels and high-technology structure of industry &mdash; Northern Ireland was either  falling behind Great Britain or was doing no better than keeping pace. One  economic strategy was failing, but the direct rule Minister simply pulled  another one, like the proverbial rabbit, out of the hat. That is not rational  policy-making.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The motion, which the Secretary of State has handed down to  us in a non-amendable form, refers to the Northern Ireland and Republic of  Ireland economies. The Ulster Unionist Party is not afraid of soundly-based,  mutually beneficial, democratically accountable co-operation, but we must ask  for some economic realism. The Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland  economies are already well integrated. That was recognised in a report this  spring by the Irish Business and Employers&rsquo; Confederation, which is the Republic  of Ireland&rsquo;s equivalent of the CBI. The report showed that the flow of road  traffic across the Irish border every day is the same as that between England  and Scotland. Members may say, &ldquo;So what?&rdquo; The combined population of England  and Scotland is 10 times that of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  That statistic hardly suggests that the two Irish economies lack economic  integration.</p>
				<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;People of the same trade seldom meet together, even  for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against  the public&rdquo;.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">That was written in the eighteenth century by Adam Smith,  the founder of economics. I would not apply that quotation to the Northern  Ireland Business Alliance and what they said this morning, but there are two  necessary points of caution. We must sift business proposals, because not all  are for the general social good, and different business leaders suggest  different things, such as calling for a change in the rate of corporation tax  or for tax allowances.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Madam Speaker, this debate comes three and a half years late &mdash; certainly too  late for the 400 people in the Coleraine area who have lost their jobs in the  past 10 weeks.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">There have been redundancies and threats of redundancies  across the North.</p>
				<p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: Will  the Member give way?</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  No, I have only five minutes.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">We can expect more redundancies when industrial derating  changes rise above 25%. Sadly, many of those jobs will be lost in the most  disadvantaged areas of the North. If the economy is to prosper and the haemorr&shy;haging  of the population is to stop, unconditional power sharing must be restored. If  it is not, the situation will become worse. Indeed, the North/South bodies must  be taken off care and maintenance, and the political trips to Killarney must  cease to be one-day wonders. Personally, I fancy Kinsale.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Since this Assembly met last, the agricultural industry has  gone into rapid decline, with thousands of farmers losing their livelihoods.  The textile industry has been decimated, and many more jobs in call centres and  in the engineering and electronics sectors have gone abroad. Our skills  shortage, which has been referred to several times, is a serious problem.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Members, the chatting that is going on means that it is becoming hard to hear  the Member who is speaking.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  can cope with it, Madam Speaker. It is not a problem.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">In the North of Ireland, 250,000 people are experiencing  the skills shortage that Sir Reg Empey spoke so eloquently about earlier. That  is a problem for this Assembly. Mind you, judging by the rapport across the  Floor, I am not so sure.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Commitments to decentralise the Civil Service must be made  to catalyse the regeneration of the economies of our towns across the North.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>:  Will the Member give way to a fellow westerner?</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  have already said that I will not give way.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The 19% rise in regional rates has left many businesses  reeling, with no idea how they will absorb this hike now that competition from  the multinationals is at an all-time high.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">As a direct result of the Review of Public Admin&shy;istration,  many people in local councils will lose their jobs. Again, no one has outlined  how those jobs will be replaced. For the past three-and-a-half years, there has  been no Public Accounts Committee to investigate fraud and to query the way in  which civil servants spend public money. That is totally irresponsible. If a  working party is to be set up to consider the economic challenges facing  Northern Ireland, it must be understood clearly that it is time-limited and  cannot be viewed as part of an ongoing shadow Assembly. The SDLP will play no  part in that and expects full devolution to be delivered before the deadline  set by the two Governments.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">We must mark today as a milestone from which there is no  turning back. No u-turns, no somersaults, no side deals &mdash; only a genuine desire  to earn our money by working for this generation and for future generations.  Perhaps it is unwise to dream, but I have a vision of a future where there is  no bitterness &mdash; such as that which I have experienced across the Chamber &mdash; and  no desire to do people down because they are different or hold political views  that are at odds with others. Is it too much to expect that division can be replaced  by diversity; that hope will replace hopelessness; and that a new vision will  overcome the darkness of the past, which left everyone blind? I thank those  Members who had the courtesy to listen to me.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  My contribution is unashamedly parochial. Over the past 10 years, the  constituency of Strangford has witnessed a colossal downturn in its indigenous  manufacturing industries. The promised peace dividend has not materialised.  Industries and businesses, which have formed the foundation of the local  economy, are declining and disappearing at an alarming rate.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The cumulative effect of the demise of Harland and Wolff;  the job losses from Bombardier Shorts, TK-ECC in Dundonald and the textile  industry; and the decline in the fishing industry has been to rob the area of  its traditional employment base. At the same time, however, Government has  sought proactively to ignore that fact and to avoid, as much as possible,  marketing the Strangford and east Belfast area as a location suitable for  inward investment.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">If 5,000 jobs had been lost in constituencies such as West  Belfast or Foyle, there would have been a markedly different response from the  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. Instead, there seems to be a  fundamental unwillingness to develop a strategic approach to the crisis.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">It is as if, when investors fly into Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  capital, there is a &ldquo;No Left Turn&rdquo; sign at the exit from Belfast City Airport.  Instead the Department seems more concerned with rerouting investment to  nationalist areas of the Province, at the continued expense of areas such as  Strangford.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I wish to make it clear that I have no difficulty with  nationalist areas attracting new investment, but I do object to an uneven  playing field and the institutional discrimination practised against my  constituency and others in the east of the Province. One wonders what must  happen in my constituency before the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment sits up, takes notice and acts to deal with the crisis.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The inherent danger associated with the continuing decline  of our traditional industries is that we are not only losing jobs but witnessing  the removal of opportunities for future employment, and skills development and  retention. As the manufacturing base continues to shrink there are an  ever-decreasing number of opportunities for those with relevant skills. Some  TK-ECC employees came from industries that had closed down, such as the textile  firm in Newtownards and mid-Down.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Trimble</strong>:  Is it not a rather old-fashioned view of the economy to keep harping on about  manufacturing industry when the most profitable forms of industry are tradable  services? These are growing significantly in Northern Ireland and the level of  profit is much greater than in traditional manufacturing industries, where we  cannot hope to compete with cheap metal-bashing in the East.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  You may say that, but I could not possibly comment. I feel that every job is  important.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  And every sector.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  And every sector. Thank you for that prompt.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Every time a factory closes, opportunities for employment  are removed.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: Your husband is helpful.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Sometimes.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">If action is not taken to address the situation, the local  manufacturing industry will be consigned to the pages of the history books. Mr  Trimble seems keen for that to happen.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The TK-ECC situation also illustrates the fragility and  uncertainty that comes with new jobs that are not anchored in Northern Ireland  and which can easily be transferred to sites outside Northern Ireland and the  rest of the United Kingdom. It did not go bankrupt; it was simply axed by its  parent company. A company, therefore, can come to Northern Ireland, take  advantage of generous Government grants, and subsequently up sticks as soon as  the benefit has been obtained. With so much being made of the growth in call  centres, one only has to look to the Prudential to see that job security in  this sector is all but non-existent.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Invest Northern Ireland holds 917 acres of unused  industrial zoned land across the Province, of which 8&middot;6 acres lies in the  Strangford constituency &mdash; less than 1% of the total. The Government need to  look at equality in this respect.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members to address their comments through the Chair.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Members have referred to the fragile condition of our once-thriving  manufacturing industry &mdash; and I say that in its widest sense, not its  traditional sense &mdash; and the adverse impact of derating changes on the viability  of many of our firms. Across the UK, the manufacturing sector is perilously  small at 15%, compared with our competitors in Germany, where it is over 30%.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">In the process of downsizing we have lost 500,000 jobs  across the UK, but at the same time this Government have created over one  million public sector posts. Daily we are assailed by the Northern Ireland  Office, the local arm of the Labour Government who have created these public  sector jobs, and told that we must correct the problem. They are the people who  have caused the problem over the last 30 years.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Our local manufacturing sector has been halved over that  period, with a further 18,000 jobs predicted to disappear over the next decade.  Our wealth-creating base has been systematically reduced until it is now almost  non-existent. Simultaneously, there is the spectacle of venture capital flowing  out of Northern Ireland, often to fund developments elsewhere, and yet many  patents created by research and development projects within our universities  are still unexploited, mostly through lack of finance.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Those findings, if properly harnessed and financed in a  co-ordinated and coherent manner, could provide a platform from which to launch  new businesses. If clear links could be developed between those university  projects, available venture capital and a focused skills training programme for  our workforce, the potential would exist to achieve something worthwhile for  our economy.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Many of the vital components required to build a vibrant,  successful economy, which increasingly moves from the comfort zone of the  public sector and confidently embraces an expanding, adequately financed,  sector-focused private enterprise model are already in place. The future  co-ordination of efforts between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment and the Department for Employment and Learning, together with the  expertise of Invest Northern Ireland, must be seamless. No longer can any  vestiges of the silo mentality be tolerated. Equally, those elements within the  private sector must move away from lecturing and hectoring mode and instead  work in conjunction, providing real vision, entrepreneurial drive and a determination,  along with politicians, to lead this community forward into a vibrant and  economically stable future.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Employment and Learning corporate plan  perhaps provides a good basis for harnessing the largely untapped expertise of  the further education colleges, through its document &lsquo;Further Education Means  Business&rsquo;. It is also in a position to ensure that the enormous research and  development potential of our universities is properly focused. I should point  out, Madam Speaker, that there are about 2,000 jobs directly involved in  research and development &mdash; much, much too low if our economy is to grow.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The small size of our manufacturing base might also lend  itself to closer scrutiny of emerging opportunities, perhaps in niche markets.  That, in turn, when supported by a focused upskilling of sectors of our  workforce, could provide a much needed source for value-added jobs. The  decision as to whether the relatively small size of the Northern Ireland  economy represents a threat or an opportunity lies firmly in the hands of the  wider business community, academia in all its forms, the financial sector, and  politicians &mdash; both local and national.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I firmly believe that it is the agreed will of all those  sectoral interests that Northern Ireland plc should not only survive, but  thrive. This debate is an important initial step towards the completion of that  necessary journey. I support the thrust of the revolution &mdash; sorry, resolution &mdash;  if not the method. <em>[Laughter].</em></p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">That was a Freudian slip; I have been sitting beside Sammy  Wilson for too long.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I support the thrust of the resolution, if not the method  by which it has arrived on the Floor of the Chamber.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I speak in this debate on the Northern Ireland economy with particular  reference to my constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone. Madam Speaker, I  have been waiting quite some time to say the words &ldquo;my constituency of  Fermanagh and South Tyrone&rdquo;, and I am delighted to be able to say them today.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  As the most westerly part of the United Kingdom, Fermanagh and South Tyrone has  its fair share of economic challenges, but likewise there are many strengths  for businesses that are not being recognised by Government because of its  rurality. The strengths are clearly in the quality of the workforce; a  workforce and a community that has suffered greatly from the downturn in  manufacturing. I note the comments of the Member for Upper Bann, but his attitude  clearly shows why the last failed Administration did not deal with the clear  signs that the manufacturing industry was on a downward spiral.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The community will again suffer in Fermanagh and South  Tyrone, and in the west in general, when the Royal Irish Regiment is disbanded.  Where will those men and women go for employment? That is a question that we  have been asking, but we are yet to hear the answer. Frankly, if jobs and  business opportunities do not present themselves locally, those people will  move from rural areas and the depopulation of the west will continue apace &mdash; a  trend accelerated by the publication of Planning Policy Statement 14 as  Government policy.</p>
				<p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The infrastructure is poor in the west. Recently, I had the  opportunity to host a visit to Fermanagh by my colleague, Jim Allister MEP, who  wanted to look at these matters. My right hon Friend, the Member for North  Antrim, Dr Paisley, mentioned European funding and the fact that the Republic  of Ireland is a huge net beneficiary from Europe. As a region, Northern Ireland  must not continue to be discriminated against in comparison with other European  regions. Indeed, my party has set that as one of its primary objectives in  Europe. While Jim Allister was in Fermanagh, we learnt of the many problems  facing companies in the constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone, including  energy costs, poor road infrastructure and the differing tax systems in  Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, not to mention the ongoing and  increasing threat of industrial derating, which is hanging over firms.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">My Friend, the Member for West Belfast, Mrs Dodds, referred  to tourism and the difficulties faced by Belfast&rsquo;s signature project. At least  Belfast has a signature project. It was a quite bizarre decision taken by the  Government not to include Fermanagh, which is Northern Ireland&rsquo;s lake district,  in signature status. It is a decision that must continue to be challenged and  that I will continue to challenge.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  Does the Member agree that it is highly regrettable that the Member of this  Assembly who represents the constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone in the  House of Commons is not present in her place this afternoon; is never present  in her place in the House of Commons; and, therefore, is incapable of  representing the people who elected her? The sooner the Member behind me is the  Member of Parliament for that constituency, the better.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  You may say that, I could not possibly comment. I will comment, however, on the  fact that the Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, who sits here and in  another place, does not come to represent the interests of her constituents.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The motion looks for solutions. Solutions to all these  problems can be found through joined-up thinking, and that is why I support the  creation of the working group. However, let me be clear: when looking for  solutions, such a working group must take all of Northern Ireland into account  and not just, as is regrettably so often the case, seek solutions to fit a  Belfast-centric model. One size will not fit all in this instance, which is why  I ask that when the working group is set up, it be geographically  representative. I hope that the Secretary of State will take cognisance of that  point when it comes before him.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I end with a positive message from the west. Business plans  are in place for St Angelo airport, situated to the north of Enniskillen, and  if the plans come to fruition, the vision of two local businessmen will offer  significant economic potential for Fermanagh and, indeed, the whole region. The  Member for North Antrim, Dr Farren, made mention of quality skilled jobs, and  if the project comes to fruition, the jobs provided will be just so. We need to  foster and assist the entrepreneurial talents of our indigenous people, and I trust  that the working group will take that into account and make it its primary  focus, and that the Government agencies involved with projects such as these  will act expeditiously.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  There are major economic challenges facing all of us. It is clear also to the  SDLP that the people who sent us here expect us to do something about those  challenges and to act very soon to correct the punitive policies of the direct  rule Administration. Pending restoration, the current political imperative to  enable us to act on those challenges lies with the British and Irish  Governments, but the community imperative demands that we get our acts  together; get all the institutions up and running, as per the Good Friday  Agreement; and set the economic and infrastructure agenda for the next 25  years.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">That is a major challenge, which is now more compelling  than ever and will not wait for another generation to implement. Despite the  improved headline unemployment figures, our economy is not in good shape. By  comparison with anywhere else in these islands, a low proportion of our people  are economically active. By comparison with almost anywhere in the world, we  have an inordinate dependence on the public purse. To put it bluntly, our  economy is unsustainable, even in the medium term.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Of all the challenges facing us in the economic sphere, the  first and major one, the absolute starting point for regeneration and  resurgence, is the lack of political stability.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">What our people need above all is a better life; we in this  Chamber have the power to give them that. They need each of us to commit  ourselves to the re-establishment of political institutions without delay and  to a final end to sectarianism, violence, terror, criminality and racketeering,  and to stand up for a lawful society and for policing institutions. That is  what is needed to unlock our economic potential, to attract more inward  investment, and to emulate and share in the outstanding growth and development  in the Southern part of our island.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">There is also a challenge for each one of us to put in  place political structures that will say goodbye to disadvantage and  deprivation, which is still rife in certain parts of Northern Ireland.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  No, I will not give way; I have only five minutes.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">There is also a challenge to each one of us to end the  geographical inequalities and inequities of the past. We must ensure that each  of our citizens has full access to all educational, employment and economic  opportunities. We cannot do these things if we permit the current lack of  regional balance, with developments clustering in the east and deprivation  clustering in the south and west, to continue. There will not be balanced  development unless and until we can offer well-distributed infrastructural  investment on the quality levels demanded by investors &mdash; a revised and upgraded  infrastructure with the development of all transportation networks on an  all-island basis. Hence our policy of wanting the establishment of an  all-island infrastructure and transportation body.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Solid, joint intergovernmental political action is now  required to establish that body and to put it on board the North/South agenda.  Economic competitiveness depends on the sound development of roads and railway  infrastructure on an all-island basis.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Trimble</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  No, I will not give way; I have only five minutes.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Many infrastructural challenges that would improve our  economy and job-creation potential await us. There is a compelling need for all  the political institutions of the Good Friday Agreement to be restored  immediately in order to ensure that the infrastructural challenges that we need  to address to meet the economic demands and challenges that we were told about  this morning are fully addressed for the benefit of all on this island.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  May I remind Members that several Members are making their maiden speeches in the  House. I ask Members to accord them some courtesy.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  From the boardroom to the shop floor, from the innovative and inventive to the  inquisitive and the motivational, from the understanding and development of new  technologies to the production of reliable skilled tradesmen &mdash; all in the  beginning have first to be taught and then to find the opportunity to excel in  their choice of future employment.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The consequences of damaging the business community&rsquo;s  confidence in our education system&rsquo;s ability to secure proven academic and  vocational entrance into the world of employment are too dire to contemplate. In  this small nation of 1&middot;6 million people, education has to be the keystone that  guarantees Northern Ireland a role not only in job creation but in bringing  forward those who can more than hold their own in sustaining our economy by  competing with the best of other economies. A strong economy and an excellent  education system are dependent on each other. Each will have a lasting effect  on people&rsquo;s standards and their quality of life.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Therein lies a challenge. It is, if you wish, a gauntlet to  be received and acted on, or some day soon it will be stroked across our faces  because too many failed to engage at the first hurdle and too little was done  about it in this place.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I refer to House of Commons Hansard and a speech by the  late Harold McCusker on 19 June 1979. He said:</p>
				<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I cite the previous Secretary of State for Northern  Ireland as my reason for saying that, because when he visited various parts of  the world to attract industry to Northern Ireland at a very difficult time,  what was one of his principal arguments?</p>
				<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">It was that we have one of the finest educational  systems in the United Kingdom. He could show a record in A-level and O-level  achievement which was better than that of anywhere else in the United Kingdom.  He was citing that as one of his principal arguments for encouraging industry  to come to Northern Ireland at the same time as he was setting about  dismantling that system in the Province. &rdquo;</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Somehow, I have heard that before. Is it not incredible  that, some 27 years later, in this Chamber, I would use Harold McCusker&rsquo;s  analogy linking education and business to make the point that, if we want to  attract the best business investment, we must offer the best of all educational  opportunities?</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I support setting up a working group. Let it draw its  expertise from this body, and let it report sooner, rather than later. Let it  not be just something that we discuss here and then find that it goes to the  consultation chamber.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I end by saying that, uniquely, this debate could result in  myself and others not making just our maiden speeches, but our only speeches in  this Chamber. I hope that, as we contemplate this motion and our  responsibilities to the economy, this will not be the last time, and that we  will participate in debate and send a message and a signal to the public that  this is the place to do business, and this is from where our economy will be  driven and survive.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  Following my good colleague Arlene Foster, I will mainly focus on the rural  constituencies. The constituency of West Tyrone has much to gain from the  establishment of a meaningful working group to consider the economic challenges  that face our Province. Over the past 35 years, West Tyrone has witnessed the very  fabric of its economy torn apart by terrorism. In the most recent years, it has  suffered severely from huge job losses.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">In Strabane, hundreds of jobs have been lost at companies  such as Adria and Herdmans, while Omagh has seen the closures of the Desmonds,  Nestl&eacute; and Rixell factories, with little or virtually no support or assistance  from Invest Northern Ireland when it was requested.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Added to that, we have the uncertainties and concerns  surrounding the current vacuum in the provision of proper acute healthcare  provision for the south-west quarter of Northern Ireland. Although lifting the  ban on exports of UK beef gave some hope to the rural economy, West Tyrone is  set to suffer yet another blow through the decision to close the St Lucia and  Lisanelly Army bases.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Far too often in the political storm surrounding these  announcements, the fate of the many civilian workers is forgotten. Those are  the people who will often struggle to find new employment as a result of having  previously being employed in security bases. The closure of those bases will  bring a large number of people out of economic productivity. It will be a huge  challenge to ensure that the economy can be developed and that there are  employment prospects for all those people.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">There is, of course, also the added knock-on effect from  the reduction of spending power, which will affect shops and other businesses  in the surrounding area. When we access the indices of deprivation measures,  areas such as West Tyrone are shown to be in need of help from a detailed look  at the economy. Although I have mentioned some of the larger businesses that  have closed in recent years, there are still many companies operating in rural  areas that must be given the opportunity to compete on a level playing field.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">A border region such as West Tyrone would severely suffer  from a decision to push ahead with the end of industrial derating. Businesses  in Omagh and Strabane have to look only a few miles across the border to see  their competitors operating in a low-cost environment. While I appreciate that  it is not the place for Government or this Assembly to do the job of  businesses, we must create the best possible conditions for businesses to  compete.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Businesses operating across Northern Ireland, particularly  in rural areas such as West Tyrone, have much higher costs to contend with,  such as electricity and transport costs, to name a few. However, one advantage  that we have been able to highlight has been the derating of industrial  businesses.</p>
				<p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
				<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Manufacturing industries are not unwilling to pay  rates, but they have rightly pointed out the need for the current rate of 25%  to be kept. That is on a level with the rate set by the Government for freight  transport companies and would allow the Government to set a sensible level of  rating while not forcing companies to operate at an unsustainable cost base.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The Government have stated that they will listen to the  views of the Assembly. I hope that they will follow that through and listen to  what has been said today regarding the problems facing our economy and the  measures that can be put in place to help remedy them. Areas such as West  Tyrone face many problems, and I hope that a meaningful working group will help  to deliver a strong and stable economy in my constituency.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  At the outset, I wish to express my disgust at the absence of one party from  the Chamber. So much for its commitment to the Northern Ireland economy; but  then it was always more committed to the night shift than the day shift.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">A number of aspects of the Northern Ireland economy must  change if the situation is to improve. The Province has a massively inflated  public sector, and it is essential that we move quickly from a  public-sector-dominated economy to one that is much more heavily influenced by  the private sector. Such a transition, clearly, must be delicately overseen and  managed.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Private sector investment must be encouraged, as it will  prove difficult to sustain the current levels of public expenditure. Likewise,  it is difficult to see how, in the short term, the private sector could fully  compensate for the decline in historic levels of public expenditure. We  currently spend billions more than our economy generates.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">A comprehensive, new economic strategy for the Province is  needed; a budget allocation for economic development should be ring-fenced and  utilised to encourage job creation.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The size of central Government should be reduced. For many  years, since the signing of the outdated Belfast Agreement, my party has  advocated that.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I remain to be convinced that the Review of Public  Administration will effect any substantial savings. In fact, it has been  suggested that the new structures for local government, health and education  will cost more. A reduction in the number of Government Departments would be  much more productive.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Economic and social policy and its delivery should not be  considered in isolation from plans for infra&shy;structure, education and training.  It will be difficult to increase our competitiveness globally, unless we are able  to develop a world-class infrastructure in Northern Ireland. Our schools and  education system must encourage children to consider careers in business.  Similarly, school leavers must be provided with the necessary skills to  succeed. Greater effort must be directed towards improving the marketing and  sales techniques of our graduates and workforce.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Our current investment in innovation, research and  development is among the lowest in the world. The managed transition away from  the public-sector-led economy requires private sector expansion, increased  foreign investment, growth in indigenous businesses and an increased  entrepreneurial spirit. Relaxing unnecessary legislation and speeding up our  labour planning process will stimulate investment in infrastructure and housing  as well as reduce reliance on public expenditure.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">There may be some areas in which working with the Irish  Republic will prove to be in our interest and aid competitiveness. That is what  it is about, and it is not an excuse for others to make foolish attempts to  obtain political capital.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The percentage of the working-age population in employment  or at participation level is at a record low. To meet the UK average  participation level by 2015 means creating 68,000 additional jobs in Northern  Ireland. Furthermore, our growing population means that 40,000 extra jobs are  also required over the same period. Add that to the anticipated number of job  losses over the next decade in such sectors as manufacturing and agriculture,  and the overall total is above 140,000. Therefore, to reach by 2015 the average  work participation rate for the rest of the United Kingdom, 140,000 new jobs  must be created.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">When economic indicators are considered, areas of the  Northern Ireland economy appear to perform well. Northern Ireland has performed  best of all UK regions over the past decade in growth in employment, reduction  in unemployment, and the percentage of school leavers with qualifications. The  last statistic is one that Northern Ireland Ministers conveniently ignore when  they attack our education system.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Business survival rates are also quite good in the  Province, but there are a large number of other indicators on which we fare  badly. These include long-term unemployment, business formation, activity  rates, the proportion of private sector employment, average earnings, and the  percentage of the working-age population with more than two A-level passes. It  would be remiss of me not to mention business crime, regrettably all too  common, and on the increase. As one who has had some experience in the fuel  retailing business, I know the impact of smuggling and racketeering, emanating  in many cases from the paramilitaries. Business leaders and politicians must be  seen to fully back the PSNI and all other agencies in the fight against crime.  This gangsterism has caused, and is causing, job losses in businesses and small  businesses around Northern Ireland.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  I want to talk briefly about our skills base. Colleagues have covered the issue  of tax rates and the need for some co-ordinated plan. However, how can we hope  to compete without a properly developed skills base? A Member has described  Northern Ireland as having one of the lowest participation rates in the United  Kingdom. The economically inactive surely need to be encouraged to take full  advantage of the training programmes available.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">More importantly, we have a difficulty with schools. We are  sending 25% of children out of schools into the workplace ill-equipped to deal  with the jobs available. There are problems with mathematics, speaking in  public, writing letters and particularly in the modern age, computer skills.  How can our children compete in the job market if we are sending them out of  our schools not equipped to do the jobs?</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">In a more confusing area, we are sending our children out  of universities incapable of going into the industrial world. Colleagues will  be aware that Bombardier Shorts has a special course for its university  graduates. It finds it has to retrain them in mathematics, speaking and writing  letters, because they come out of university not equipped for these jobs. It  will not allow them into the company without taking this course.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Unless we get our act together with a co-ordinated plan  that allows us to train our schoolchildren properly so that they leave with the  skills required; go through university gaining the skills required; and at the  end of all this co-ordinate with industry on the skills required by industry,  and not on what academia thinks is needed, then we are really going to get  nowhere on this issue.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  We in this House are faced with an awesome responsibility in relation to the  political future of this Assembly and of the institutions under the Good Friday  Agreement. That responsibility is a heavy one and is one that we should take  very seriously. Many people have come to this House with very little hope,  indeed some with no hope.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I remind the House that C S Lewis, who was educated not far  from here at Campbell College, said that between little hope and no hope lies  an ocean of opportunity. We do have an ocean of opportunity. One of the most  vital tasks of this House is to prepare an economic plan that the incoming  Executive can implement on behalf of all the people whom we represent, not just  in our constituencies, but throughout the whole of Northern Ireland. That is an  important task. It is not something to take lightly. There is a false sense of  security in the House that the economy will plough on despite everything. That  is untrue. This economy is highly subsidised and dependent on the public  sector. We need to shift that balance to an entrepreneurial economy in which  everybody will be enriched.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">We look across the border to the Republic and see the  amazing success of the Celtic tiger. That success was based on one basic  resource: a highly educated young population. We have that educated young  population and we can adjust our education system to service the needs of our  future economy and of an entrepreneurial society. We can do that, but we must  get our act together politically. The first building block of reconstructing  our economy is to create political confidence that will inspire people outside  this jurisdiction to come and invest money to create industry in which all our  people can partake. That is our solemn task in this House today and throughout  the coming months.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">It is a pity that some people have absented themselves and  have evaded or avoided their responsibilities to complete that task. There is  nothing in the motion that is antipathetic to the idea of creating a new  Northern Ireland Executive. In fact, the motion is very much attuned with the  creation of that Executive. Those people have no political excuse for not being  in this Chamber. They are denying their constituents and the rest of the people  of Northern Ireland an opportunity for this House to unite around a  comprehensive economic programme that can rebuild this society, which has  suffered for too long not just from them, their supporters and their allies,  but from others who have taken advantage of the situation. Therefore, we must  renew our efforts to deal with that situation.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">A second important building block is the creation of a new  fiscal policy that will encourage industry in Northern Ireland. We have a land  border; one of our colleagues said that, in many ways, the economy is  integrated both North and South, but we must have a competitive, level playing  field for Northern Ireland. Therefore, we must fiscally attune the situation  here with that pertaining in the Republic. It is vital that we get that fiscal  policy well defined so that we can all unite behind it, and when we go to the  Westminster Government, we can say that we have a consensus on which we are all  agreed. That will transform our economy and society. We have another advantage,  namely that we are members of the European Union, which is an extensive market  of which we should take advantage.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Finally, if the Secretary of State is serious about this  motion, he should take the serious step of ending the introduction of punitive  measures that will undermine business in Northern Ireland.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  There was much talk today, both this morning and this afternoon, about the size  of the public sector and the private sector. However, let us be clear that the  problem in Northern Ireland is not that the public sector is too big. I am not  going to stand here and advocate sacking a single teacher, nurse or police  officer. The issue is how we grow the private sector.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">It is a simple fact that, within the last decade, in the  Republic of Ireland, the public sector has grown. However, the private sector  has grown enormously. The balance in the Republic has shifted and we must  emulate that.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I wish to refer to some points made by other Members. The  key ingredient for growing that private sector is getting away from the current  low-skills and low-wage expectation of much of that economy. There is a real  need to do much more on worker skills and training, and on integrating the work  done by business with further and higher education.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">There are real problems in the pseudo-competition that  exists among a number of institutions. The Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development showed the way when it established the three-campus College of  Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">It deals in a collaborative way with all the aspects that  are relevant to one of our major sectors. Unfortun&shy;ately, the competition among  colleges to obtain money by getting people into the lecture halls means that we  may not have the necessary level of co-operation. There is much need for  competition in the private sector, but there is greater need for co-operation  in the public sector to deliver the range of services that is needed to build that  private sector economy.</p>
				<p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I refer to the speech &mdash; sorry, the intervention &mdash; by Mrs  Dodds during Mr Neeson&rsquo;s speech; a key issue regarding tourism has not been  teased out properly. There is no doubt that we need to build on our tourism  honeypots, but there is, moreover, no doubt that the tourism Northern Ireland  will attract is heritage tourism or green tourism, and that can apply in every  part of Northern Ireland. It is easy to see areas such as my constituency of  South Antrim, which sits wedged between the Belfast honeypot and the Causeway  Coast honeypot, as being purely for people to drive through, from one honeypot  to another. Yet there is potential for developing other aspects of tourism in  those areas. We cannot simply leave tourism to crowding people into central  Belfast or one or two other resorts.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">If we are to look seriously at the target of 141,000 new  jobs, we must consider what can be done to attract foreign direct investment.  There is no doubt that the record that Northern Ireland had some years ago has  slipped recently, and it is a major target for Invest Northern Ireland to  reach. We must consider the possibilities and we also have to be realistic, in  that certain trades may work to our good, but there are others that we can no  longer realistically depend upon. We cannot depend upon heavy engineering as  being a growth area; we may or may not hold on to what we have. We need to find  such issues as tradable services to avail of the opportunities that are there,  and we must also consider the expectation that we will not attract the foreign  investment that we hoped for to grow our own SME sector. There are major  challenges in developing investment, training and R&amp;D in a sector which is  so dependent upon small and medium-sized firms. Yet, if we do not, we will not  achieve the growth that is possible in Northern Ireland.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">On the issue of taxation, it is clear that merely the  ability to fiddle with the regional rate and industrial rates will not meet the  needs of this sector. We are in direct competition with a low corporation tax  economy and low excise duties across the border. During the economic briefing  this morning, the business leaders suggested the need for a detailed research  project on how lowering tax rates might improve total tax take in terms of  corporation tax and income tax, and there is no doubt that that is of key  importance.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">However, another aspect, which has been almost ignored this  afternoon, is how we actually seek to build a shared future in this society.  There is no doubt that the successful economies across the world are those that  are open, welcoming and integrated. We are getting a share of that with our new  citizens coming from eastern Europe, but it is clear that until we provide  opportunities for every person in this society, regardless of background, we  will not have the economic growth that we need.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  It is almost 20 years since I last spoke in this Chamber, and, on that  occasion, the party opposite &mdash; the SDLP &mdash; was not present, but I genuinely  welcome its presence today. Also, on that occasion, the party known as Sinn  F&eacute;in was absent, and, once again, it is absent today. Republicans ought to have  learned by now that abstentionist politics does not get them anywhere, and it  fails their constituents. They ought to be here today, putting their point of  view. Their failure to attend the debate just demonstrates &mdash;</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Please address the motion, Mr Donaldson.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  &mdash; demonstrates their apathy, Madam Speaker, towards the business community and  towards addressing the problems in our economy, and that is highly regrettable.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  The motion calls for the establishment of a working group, and I hope that Sinn  F&eacute;in will not be absent from that. It is essential that all the parties put  their shoulders to the wheel to address the issues that concern the people that  we represent. The presentation from the business leadership this morning was  important, and I do not understand why Sinn F&eacute;in could be there to hear it but  did not have the good grace to come and debate the issues that were raised.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">We have a window here, an opportunity. There is leverage in  advance of the Administration being re-formed at some appropriate time in the  future. There is leverage to apply to the Government at Westminster. We must  use this opportunity to get what we need in order to build a strong economy.  Unfortunately, that will not be helped if one party absents itself from the job  at hand.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">We heard this morning that long-term unemployment in  Northern Ireland is the highest in the United Kingdom. Of particular concern is  the fact that youth unemploy&shy;ment here is also the highest in the United  Kingdom. We need to offer our young people some hope &mdash; especially those who  find themselves unemployed. That is why this debate is important.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I listened with interest to the comments made by the hon  Member for Upper Bann, who is, unfortunately, no longer in his place &mdash; as is  the case across the water. It will come as a disappointment to his colleague,  who is a party officer. Of course, being an officer in the Ulster Unionist  Party Assembly Group means something rather different after yesterday.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Mr Donaldson, please keep to the motion.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  There is a lot of emotion, Madam Speaker.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">His colleague Basil McCrea, whom I have worked with very  closely on the issue of industrial derating, will have been disappointed to  hear the hon Member for Upper Bann say that manufacturing is not the future for  our economy in Northern Ireland. Manufacturing is the future, as indeed are  tradable services. Of course we welcome investment in those areas, but we need  to support and develop the manufacturing sector.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The reality, as we heard this morning, is that only 65  businesses in Northern Ireland employ more than 500 people. Many of these are  manufacturing companies, and they need our support. Montupet (UK) Ltd, in my  constituency, has over 700 employees. The company faces an industrial rates  bill of almost &pound;1 million. What will that do for the future employment  prospects of the people who work at Montupet in Dunmurry, or, indeed, at  Harland and Wolff, which is facing a potential rates bill of &pound;4&middot;375 million?</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Surely we should be doing something to help the  manufacturing sector. Indeed, we took a cross-party delegation to meet the  Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to put the case for capping those  rates. That set an example. The working group would be able to take that issue  forward, and other matters affecting the wider economy.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">We need to help our economy; we need to help our  businesses; we need to support our manufacturing sector. That means an end to  the ongoing situation where the Government are taxing our businesses out of  business. We, as political leaders, have a responsibility to do something about  that. An all-party approach in the working group is the way forward.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Northern Ireland is over-dependent on the public sector. The days of  significant increases in public sector funding are over. We face a bleak and  degrading future if Northern Ireland has to rely on diminishing public funding  in the long term. As politicians, we must help create the space for existing  businesses and new enterprises to develop. More importantly, we must not create  barriers to industrial development.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Engineers, scientists and entrepreneurs are the drivers of  the economy. Politicians must contribute political stability. That may be the  greatest contribution we can make to our local economy. We must all lead by  example and not allow historic intransigence or emotive rhetoric to be  misunderstood by our impressionable young people. We must all support the  police and act to end all criminality and street conflict. Was that not agreed eight  years ago, but not delivered by some?</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">We must ensure that Northern Ireland is business-friendly  and learn lessons from other successful regions. We must forget about the  politically charged rhetoric of an all-Ireland economy, which detracts from establishing  genuine good relations. Manufacturing sales and exports surveys from last  November reveal that 43&middot;5% of Northern Ireland exports went to other regions of  the United Kingdom, while 11&middot;6% went to the Republic of Ireland. We must not  narrow our vision to the so-called all-Ireland economy, but help local  businesses to improve and export against European and global competitors.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>:  We heard Mrs Foster, John Dallat and Tom Buchanan, representatives from the  west, talk about the economic difficulties there. Does my Friend agree that it  would be better for us as an Assembly to consider the east-west dimension  within Northern Ireland, and with regard to the UK, rather than the  Belfast-Dublin economic corridor?</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The figures that I quoted clearly indicate that I do.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">We must look for markets wherever they exist, because with  businesses and export markets come jobs. We must allow business to establish  where the markets are. If business activity is to be led by Government policy  intervention, it must be mutually beneficial and subject to genuine local  democratic accountability and scrutiny.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The recent industrial derating issue has shown how  disengaged our locally unaccountable Northern Ireland Office Ministers are from  the needs of the local business community. Our businesses compete over a land  border and within a different fiscal regime, and that has not been taken into  consideration. The Treasury and Northern Ireland Office Ministers appear unconcerned  about the potential for company relocation to the Republic of Ireland, which is  seen by some as more business-friendly. Why should we allow Invest Northern  Ireland to spend millions encouraging inward investment when the full rates  proposed for industrial premises have the potential to export or end many  existing jobs? Clearly the planned manufacturing rates increases must be  halted. A convincing and collective case must be put to the Treasury for the  improvement of fiscal conditions to encourage development within Northern  Ireland.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">A prosperous economy will create opportunities for young  people and enable any future Northern Ireland Executive to blossom. Market  leaders such as Schrader Electronics, and FG Wilson in my own constituency,  have led with R&amp;D. They are worldwide leaders, and their exports are  significant. As a region we need to change our approach to wealth generation.  We must become more business-friendly. The efforts of our schools and colleges  must closely meet the needs of local industry.</p>
				<p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">We would have liked to improve the wording of the motion,  but, regrettably, that has not been possible. In particular, there is a need  for a restoration-of-devolution committee, without which this is a lot of hot  air. We could have six months of hot air, so I urge that such a committee be  established as soon as possible so that we ourselves can make decisions in the  future. I support the motion, and I hope that other Members will do so also.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dawson</strong>: I  am glad of the opportunity to take part in this useful, and mostly  constructive, debate. I agree with the Member from North Belfast, Mr Maginness,  and my own colleague from Lagan Valley that it is a scandal that the Benches  opposite are empty today as we discuss the economic future of Northern Ireland.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">However, it is not surprising that Sinn F&eacute;in, which has  nothing to offer economically, is not here to debate the economic future of the  country. Whatever its public reason, I suspect that its real reason for not  being here is that its Members cannot handle having to operate in a situation  where they are armed only with the powers of argument and persuasion, like the  rest of us.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Many issues have been referenced over and over again today  by Members, both in the Northern Ireland Business Alliance meeting earlier this  morning and in this afternoon&rsquo;s debate. Reference has been made to skills,  education, reducing bureaucracy, improving planning infrastructure and  processes, developing infrastructure, and reducing business costs, including  industrial rates. The working party can constructively examine and take forward  all of those issues and make recommendations to the Secretary of State on how  the economy can be bettered. However, whatever the future arrangements, we must  ensure that an Audit Committee is not allowed to strangle a developing  flexibility and entrepreneurial culture in Northern Ireland, as it did in the  past.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I wish to refer to two specific issues. First, there is the  issue of North/South co-operation. I have no hesitation in saying that in  regard to strength, scale and long-term stability, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s best  economic interests lie within the United Kingdom, and within a United Kingdom  context. However, my political convictions do not preclude me from  wholeheartedly supporting the principle of economic co-operation with our Irish  neighbours where that co-operation is practically and not politically motivated  and where it is of economic benefit to the people of Northern Ireland. Trade  between our two jurisdictions is of considerable benefit to many companies in  Northern Ireland. That is the stuff of normal trade and politics; it is not the  domain of politicians.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farren</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dawson</strong>:  No, I will not.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I have no hesitation in encouraging companies to avail of  that trade or in providing the opportunity for them to avail of that trade.  That might refer to some matter on which the Member wanted me to give way.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">However, no one should forget for a second that the  Republic of Ireland is our economic competitor. Often, in the clamour to  promote a false all-island economy, that fundamental fact is forgotten, along  with two other harsh realities: there are two currencies and two tax regimes in  the island of Ireland.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">That takes me to my second point, which is corporation tax.  I can understand the reticence of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government in relation to  differential tax rates across the kingdom, but there are precedents. The  challenge to the working party and others will be to convince Her Majesty&rsquo;s  Government of the negative effect of a 30% corporation tax in Northern Ireland,  in comparison to our competitors in the South. Another challenge will be to  convince the Government that because Northern Ireland&rsquo;s position is unique &mdash; in  that it shares a land border with another European state and is in transition  from over three decades of violence and civil strife &mdash; it deserves a period of  managed special treatment.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">If, as they claim, the Government are serious about  improving Northern Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and making it world class, the  Secretary of State&rsquo;s single most important step would be to consider seriously  a lower corporation tax rate for Northern Ireland, below that prevailing in the  Republic of Ireland. That can be done either by changing the headline rate or  by a cocktail of measures focusing on research and develop&shy;ment, marketing and  training that would help not only foreign direct investors, but indigenous  companies.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">That, Madam Speaker, brings me to my conclusion. Although  on some occasions it seems that Northern Ireland is struggling as an economy,  and there are economic challenges facing us in the twenty-first century,  Northern Ireland is well placed to meet those challenges. With the right  incentives and the right level playing field, Northern Ireland can go forward  to a better future.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
				<p class="Q3Motion">That the Assembly considers the economic challenges facing  Northern Ireland, in the context of both the UK and all island economies, to be  a key priority for a restored Executive and calls on the Business Committee to  take forward establishing a working group on this issue to make recommendations  to a restored Executive.</p>
